It， therefore， represents a significant global health burden， disproportionately affecting those in the world’s poorest countries. However， deaths from PPH can be prevented. This study aimed to determine the prevalence， probable cause and risk factors and management of primary postpartum haemorrhage in patients delivered at a tertiary health care hospital in West Bengal， India. Methods： This study was a prospective observational study conducted in the Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology of Burdwan Medical College and Hospital， Burdwan， West Bengal， from April 2020 to September 2022 after getting approval from the Institutional Ethical Committee. 100 case of PPH was chosen randomly after applying exclusion criteria. The template was generated in an MS excel sheet， and analysis was done on SPSS. Results： In the present study most common age group developed PPH was 21-30 years. Multiparas are at higher risk of developing PPH. In this study， 77% of the population is multipara. In the present study， 52% of the population had blood loss due to PPH being less than 1L. only 6% had blood loss of more than 2L. A most common cause of PPH. In this study， 70% of the population had Atonic Uterus， 19% had traumatic PPH， and 11% had retained conception products. Most of the cases of the study population were managed by medical management (58%). 42% of the study population was managed surgically. Conclusions： Mostly， the women who delivered vaginally developed PPH. Every effort should be made to create awareness. Regarding maternal health， associated Fetal and maternal morbidity can be reduced.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Complication， postpartum haemorrhage， maternal mortality\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Traditionally Postpartum haemorrhage is defined as the loss of>500 ml of blood after completion of the first stage of labour. This is problematic because almost half of all women delivered vaginally shed that amount of blood or more when losses are carefully measured. According to the American College of Ob-stetricians &. Gynaecologists (2017d) Postpartum Hemorrhage is defined as cumulative blood loss >1000 ml accompanied by signs and symptoms of hypovolemia. And almost a third of women undergoing caesarean delivery have blood loss that ex-ceeds 1000 m1.1\n\n【4】Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of ma-ternal deaths， accounting for about 35% of all maternal deaths.\n\n【5】There is a continuing trend of reduction in maternal deaths globally； however， developing countries still experience higher maternal deaths than developed countries.Most deaths (about99%) from PPH occur in lower and middle-income countries compared with only 1% in industrialized nations.4.5\n\n【6】The World Health Organization estimates that， of the 529000maternal deaths occurring every year， 136，000 take place in In-dia， amongst which postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is the most commonly reported complication (29.6%). Haemorrhage is con-sidered the major cause of maternal death in India： 38% of maternal deaths were by haemorrhage， primarily postpartum haemorrhage， according to an SRS analysis. Several studies have stated that obstetric complications are inevitable. In 2015， roughly 303，000 women's lives were estimated to be lost during and following pregnancy and childbirth. Most of these deaths occurred in low-resource settings， and most could have been prevented.\n\n【7】With the above background， the present study has been done to determine the prevalence，probable cause and risk factors and management of primary postpartum haemorrhage in patients delivered at a tertiary health care hospital in West Bengal，India.\n\n【8】Method and Materials\n\n【9】The study was conducted after receiving approval from the ethical committee of Burdwan Medical College and the hospital.\n\n【10】Study design\n\n【11】Prospective observational study.\n\n【12】Study population\n\n【13】All the mothers admitted for Obstetrics management at MACH developing Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH)， all referred cases of PPH who delivered outside， and all the cases who developed PPH after home delivery attending Emergency Obstetrics ward over one and half years.\n\n【14】Study area\n\n【15】Obstetrics and Gynaecology department of Burdwan Medical College and Hospital， Burdwan， West Bengal， India.\n\n【16】Study period\n\n【17】April 2020 to September 2021.\n\n【18】Sample size\n\n【19】100 cases of PPH were chosen randomly after applying exclusion criteria.\n\n【20】Inclusion criteria\n\n【21】The cases admitted to the Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecol-ogy of Burdwan Medical College & Hospital， Burdwan， devel-oping PPH due to uterine atony， trauma in the genital tract， and retained tissue.\n\n【22】Exclusion criteria\n\n【23】Thrombotic causes and drug-induced bleeding diathesis.\n\n【24】Study tools and techniques\n\n【25】Predesigned， pretested schedule， BP Instrument， Condom Catheter， Balloon Catheter， Balloon tamponade， Uterine Pack， Drugs (Oxytocin.

All the ante mothers admitted at BMC.F-1 for obstetrical management developing PPH， all re-ferred cases of postpartum hemorrhage (delivered outside)， and all cases of already developed postpartum haemorrhage after Home delivery attending Emergency ward of obstetrics were selected from such 100 patients with proper histories were taken， and they were examined thoroughly.\n\n【28】Age， Parity， Risk factors (such as Anemia， prolonged labour， Preeclampsia & Eelampsia， twin pregnancy，APH)， mode of de-livery， place of delivery classifications of PPR amount of blood loss， causes of PPEl， types of interventions and maternal out-come noted. Investigations such as blood for 1-1b%， TC， DC， and ESR were sent. All vitals， such as HP， Pulse， and sp02， were monitored. After collecting all data from obstetrics wards and CCU ward records， data were analyzed using the appropriate statistical method.\n\n【29】Statistical analysis\n\n【30】Statistical analysis was done using Microsoft Excel and SPSS software. P<0.05% was considered significance level for the study.\n\n【31】The study proposal and other relevant documents were sub-mitted to the institutional committee for review and approval. However， the study commenced only after such approval was obtained in writing from Informed consent to participate in the study was obtained from all the eligible women.\n\n【32】Results\n\n【33】A hospital-based prospective observational study was carried out in the Department of Gynecology & Obstetrics， Burdwan Medical College and Hospital， Burdwan， West Bengal， India. All the mothers admitted for Obstetrics management at MACH developing Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH)， all referred cases of PPH who delivered outside， all the cases who developed PPH after home delivery attending Emergency Obstetrics ward over a period of one and a half from the period April 2020 to September2021. In addition， 100 cases of PPH were chosen randomly after applying exclusion criteria.\n\n【34】In the present study， the most common age group that de-veloped PPH was 21-30. This study's next common age group is 31-40 vears (31%). Less than 20 vears is 14%， and more than40 years is 7% of the population. Multiparas are at higher risk of developing PPH. In this study，77% of the population is mul-tipara. Almost 41% of this study population did not have any risk factors. 25% of this study population had anaemia， 11% had prolonged labour， 3% had preeclampsia， 7% had eclampsia， 7%had twin pregnancies， and 6% had APH. It is noted that those who developed PPH had a vaginal delivery. In the present study，35% of the population underwent a caesarian section， and 10%had an instrumental vaginal delivery. \n\n【35】In the present study， 52% of the population had blood loss due to PPH being less than 1L. only 6% had blood loss of more than 2L； the rest， 42%， had blood loss between 1-2L. 52% of the study population had their delivery in a tertiary care centre(BMCH). 12% of the study population had home delivery. After that， they attended BMCH emergency for developing PPH and other complications. It is noted that 94% of the study population had primary PPH，and only 6% had secondary PPH. \n\n【36】In the present study， it was observed that among the pop-ulation with more than 2 litres of blood loss due to PPH， 72%had a caesarean section. Only 14% had a vaginal delivery. That blood loss was less than 1L； 80% had a vaginal delivery. In this study， we saw who developed PPH after the caesarean section had more blood loss. The relationship between the amount of blood loss and the mode of delivery is statistically significant as P <0.001. \n\n【37】In the present study， most of the cases of the study popula-tion were managed by medical management (58%). 42% of the study population was managed surgically. Only 2% of the study population died， and 98% survived. \n\n【38】In the present study， all who died had Atonic PPH. The other two causes of PPH (Traumatic and RPOC) did not cause any death due to PPH. Among those who survived， 69.4% had Atonic PPH， 19.4% had Traumatic PPH，and 11.2% had RPOC.\n\n【39】Table 1 Distribution of study population according to age， parity， risk factor and mode of delivery.\n\n| Age Range  | Number  | Percentage(%)  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ≤20 years  | 14  | 14%  |\n| 21-30 years  | 4  | 48%  |\n| 31-40 years  | 31  | 31%  |\n| ≥40 years  | 7  | 7%  |\n| Parity  |  |  |\n| PRIMI  | 23  | 23%  |\n| MUIII  | 77  | 77%  |\n| Risk Factor  |  |  |\n| None  | 41  | 41%  |\n| Anaemia  | 25  | 25%  |\n| Prolonged Labor  | 11  | 11%  |\n| Eclampsia  | 7  | 7%  |\n| APH  | 6  | 6%  |\n| Tuin Pregnancy  | 7  | 7%  |\n| Preeclampsia  | 3  | 3%  |\n| Mode of delivery  |  |  |\n| C/S  | 35  | 35%  |\n| VD  | 55  | 55%  |\n| VD (instrumental)  | 10  | 10%  |\n\n【41】Table 2 Distribution of study population according to the amount of blood loss， delivery place， and PPH classification.\n\n| Amount of blood loss  | Number  | Percentage(%)  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Less than 1L  | 52  | 52%  |\n| 1-2L  | 42  | 42%  |\n| More than 2 L  | 6  | 6%  |\n| Place of delivery  |  |  |\n| Tertiary  | 52  | 52%  |\n| Outside  | 36  | 36%  |\n| Home  | 12  | 12%  |\n| Classification ofPPH  |  |  |\n| Primary  | 94  | 94%  |\n| Secondary  | 6  | 6%  |\n\n【43】Table 3 Distribution of the study population according to the relationship between blood loss amount and delivery mode very.\n\n| Mode of delivery  | <1L  | %  | 1-2L  | %  | \\>2L  | %  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| VD  | 41  | 80  | 13  | 31  | 1  | 14  |\n| VD (instrumental)  | 6  | 12  | 3  | 7  | 1  | 14  |\n| C/S  | 4  | 8  | 26  | 62  | 5  | 72  |\n\n【45】Table 4 Study population distribution according to intervention type and maternal outcome.\n\n| Type ofinteroention  | Number  | Percentage(%)  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Medical  | 58  | 58%  |\n| Surgical  | 42  | 42%  |\n| Maternal outcome  |  |  |\n| Survived  | 98  | 98%  |\n| Deceased  | 2  | 2%  |\n\n| Causes of PPH  | Suruived  |  | Deceased  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Causes of PPH  | No.  | %  | No.  | %  |\n| Atoric  | 68  | 69.4  | 2  | 100  |\n| Traumatic  | 19  | 19.4  | 0  | 0  |\n| RPOC  | 11  | 11.2  | 0  | 0  |\n\n【48】Discussion\n\n【49】Postpartum Hemorrhage is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among pregnant ladies worldwide， especially in devel-oping countries. This study was conducted in the department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of Burdwan Medical College and Hospital. 100 consecutive case were studied.\n\n【50】Age Group\n\n【51】Our study noted that 48% of the population belonged to 21-30years， and 31% belonged to the age group 31-40 years. 14% had ages below 20 years， and 7% were above 40. Whereas in a study by Thawal Y et al.， 43.8% belonged to the age group 25-28 years， and 31.2% belonged to18-24yearrs. In the Pooja G et al. study，43% were of the age group 21-25 years.In a study by Cadre S et al.， 40-54% belonged to the age group 21-25 years.-1\n\n【52】Parity\n\n【53】In this study， it is noted that multiparas are at higher risk of developing PPPH； 77% of the study population are multipara. Only 23% are primipara. In a study by Thawal Y et al.， 60%were multipara. In a study by Edhi MM et al.， only 38.5% were primipara， and the rest were multipara.102 In the Pooja G et al. study 53% were multipara.1 In a study by Gadre S et al.， 45.94%were primipara， rest were multipara.\n\n【54】Risk factors\n\n【55】This study noted that 25% of the population had anaemia， 11%had prolonged labour， 7% had twin pregnancies， 6% had APH， and 10% had eclampsia and preeclampsia.

In a study conducted by Ngwenya S， 72% had vagi-nal delivery， 16% had LSCS， In a study conducted by Edhi M.M et al.， 61.5% had a spontaneous vaginal delivery. 38.5%had a caesarean section， and 23，1% had a vaginal delivery with episiotomy.12 In a Gadre S et al. study， 51.35% had a vaginal delivery， 5.40% had instrumental delivery， and 43.24% had a caesarean section.11\n\n【59】Amount of blood loss\n\n【60】It is noted in this study that 52% of the study population had blood loss of less than 1 Litre due to PPH. Only 6% had blood loss of more than 2 litres. Rest (42%) had blood loss 1-2 Litre. In a study conducted by Thawal Y et al.，35% had blood loss of500-999 ml， 46.2% had blood loss of 1000-1499 m1.\n\n【61】Amount of blood loss depending upon mode of delivery\n\n【62】It is noted in this study that who had blood loss of more than2 litres， 72% of them had a caesarean section， and 14% had a vaginal delivery. Of those whose blood loss was less than I Litre，80% had a vaginal delivery. This study showed that those who developed PPH after the caesarean section had more blood loss. The relationship between the amount of blood loss with the mode of delivery is statistically significant (Pvalue<0.001) in this study. In a study conducted by Ngwenya S， it was seen that those who developed PPH after normal vaginal delivery. among them， 73.2% had blood loss between 500-1000 ml， and only 1.8%had blood loss of more than 1500 ml. Of those who developed PPH after caesarean section among them， 22.2% had blood loss of more than 1500 ml.\n\n【63】Place of Delivery\n\n【64】In this study， it is noted that 52% of the study population had their delivery)，in a tertiary care centre (BMCH). 36% of the study population delivered outside the hospital after that referred POP to tertiary care centre (BMCH). 12% had home delivery， and after developing PPH， they got admitted to BMCH. In a study conducted by Edhi MM et al.， 92.3% had their deliveries in a local hospital and 7.7% in a tertiary care centre.11 In a study conducted by Cadre S et al.， 64.86% had their deliveries in a tertiary care centre， 32.43% in local hospitals and 2.7% at home.\n\n【65】Classification of PPH\n\n【66】In this study， it is noted that 94% of the study population had primary PPH， 6% had secondary PPH. In a study conducted by Edhi NIM et al.， 69.2% had primary PPH， 30.S% had secondary PPH.12\n\n【67】In this study， it is noted that 70% of the study population had PPH due to an Atonic uterus. 19% due to trauma. 11% due to RPOC (Retained product of conception). In a study conducted by Ngwenya S， 82.4% had uterine atony， and 13.5% had perineal trauma. 2.7% had RPOC. In a study conducted by Solanke P et al.， 79.17% had uterine atony， 16.67% had a traumatic cause， and 4.16% had RPOC.’ In a study conducted by Yousuf F et al.，64.4% had an atonic uterus：13 ln a study conducted by Tondge G et al.， 69% had an atonic uterus.14 la a study conducted by Pooja G et al.， 69.3% had an atonic uterus.10 In a Gadre S et al. study，70.27% had an atonic uterus， 29.72% had traumatic PPH， and23% had RPOC.11\n\n【68】Management\n\n【69】It is noted in this study that 58% of the study population was managed medically and 42% surgically. In a Tanseem F et al. study， 85.35% underwent medical management. In a study by Thawal et al.， 70% had medical management， and 30% had surgical management. In a Solanke P et al. study， 70.83%had medical management， and 29，16% had surgical management.\"\n\n【70】Maternal mortality\n\n【71】It is noted in this study that 2% died， and 98% survived. In a study conducted by Ngwenya S， 5.4% died， and 94.6%survived. In the study conducted by Solanke P et al.， one died out of 96 patients； in the study conducted by Pooja G et al.，6.06% died due to PPH.10 In a study conducted by Tondge G et al.， 5.19% died due to PPH.14\n\n【72】The outcome of PPH depending upon cause\n\n【73】This is noted from this study that all who died had Atonic PPH. The other two causes of PPH (Traumatic & RPOC) did not cause any death due to PPH， Those who survived PPH， among them69.4%， had Atonic PPH. 19.4% had Traumatic PPH， and the rest， 41.2%，had RPOC. ln， a study conducted by Devi KP et al.，15.98% died of atonic uterine.\n\n【74】Limitation of the Study\n\n【75】The present study was conducted in a rural tertiary care centre. Most people belonged to a poor socioeconomic status where concern for women’s health was less， and there were irregular antenatal checkups. Due to time limitations， the study was conducted on a few patients. Further study may be conducted with a large number of patients.\n\n【76】Conclusion and Recommendations\n\n【77】Postpartum haemorrhage is a nice way of saying that we let our women bleed to death. In this era， with excellent uterotonics and active management of third stage of labour even today， PPI-1is the leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity. Pre-ventable maternal deaths indicate a gross violation of the human right of survival and highlight the gross failure of health services on almost all fronts， particularly regarding the choice of strate-gic interventions and their extent of coverage in the population. Proper anticipation， skilled management， and timely referral of PPH cases will lead to a significant reduction in maternal mor-bidity & mortality， as PPII is a significant contributor to maternal mortality so much so that the 5th millennium development goal aims to reduce maternal mortality by primarily reducing the number of cases of PPH. Every pregnancy should culminate in ahealthy mother and baby. To reduce maternal mortality， we need to ensure that all women have access to high-quality essential and emergency obstetric service at first referral unit (FRU) level.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Ventral and dorsal bony spur occurring at a single site is a very rare form of split cord malformation. We present an extremely rare case of an adult split cord malformation Type I who was neurologically intact， and had ventral and dorsal bony spurs and a skin defects around the exposed osseous septum. Only a few cases have been reported so far in the literature. She was operated on， her fibrous spur was removed， detethering of the filum， gathering of two hemicords in a single dura and myelotomy were performed. Her postoperative condition was uneventful. Although there were many vertebrae and spinal deformities with split cord malformation， it could not be diagnosed until adulthood as the patient did not have any symptoms.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Dorsal and ventral spur， split cord malformation， surgery at diastematomyelia， adult split cord malfor-mation\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Split Cord Malformation (SCM)， which is also known as di-astematomyelia， is a rare form of closed neural tube defects . It occurs as a result of congenital division of the spinal cord and has two types . Type I contains two hemicords， each of which surrounded by its own dural sac and separated by osteocarlagi-nous rigid septum. Type II contains two hemicords in a single dural sac separated by a non-rigid septum . The septum is usually located at the caudal end of the separation in Type Ⅱ.\n\n【4】Most children born with SCM are asymptomatic at birth. Symptomatic patients may exhibit pain， gait disorders， motorand sensory deficits and autonomic system disorders .Hy-pertrichosis， dermal sinus， hyperpigmentation， cutaneous he-mangioma and skin folding may be listed as skin conditions accompanying clinical findings . Within the 2 to 3 years lifes of patients asymptomatic at birth， neurological deficits develops due to tethered cord caused by bones spurs， fibrous bands or a thickened filum terminale . The consensus on this issue is that the bone spur causing diastematomyelia should be prophy-lactically operated promptly after diagnosis since it may cause tension in the spinal cord， and consequently， neurological deficitIt is very rare that ventral and dorsal bony spur occur at a single site . We present an extremely rare case of an adult with SCM Type I who was neurologically intact， and had ventral and dorsal bony spur and a skin defect around the exposed osseous septum. Only a few cases have been reported so far in the literature.\n\n【5】Case report History and Presentation\n\n【6】A 19-year-old female patient referred with bilateral leg pain and a mass on her back which was present since her birth. Patient with a history of spontaneous vaginal delivery at home after an unsupervised pregnancy. There is no prenatal diagnosis since her mother did not consult a doctor regularly and did not have an USG during pregnancy. The patient was suffering from back and bilateral leg pains， both exacerbated after puberty. However， no visualization was performed during her prior consultation with a physician for these pains， and analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs were administered.\n\n【7】Examination Findings\n\n【8】On physical examination， her height was 1.40 meter (4 feet 71/8inches) and had an osseous exposition on her back in the midline. She did not exhibit any signs of neurological impairment. Her aim for admittance was mainly depended on aesthetic reasons， as well as an ever increasing pain on her both legs. Lumbar (L) vertebra Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) findings revealed that the L2-L3-L4-L5 vertebra corpuses were fusional， and the intervertebral disk spaces could not be differentiated in these levels， and there was butterfly vertebra configuration in L4 verte bra posterior. In addition， vertebral posterior elements were joint and dysmorphic at these levels. The spinous processes were joint and deformed. There was an osseous formation that extended to the skin fold to the right of the middle line at the level of spinous process. The spinal cord ended at the L5 vertebrae level (tethered cord). A syringohydromyelia cavity reaching a thickness of 7 mm was observed at the most prominent point of T12-11 levels in the spinal cord. There was a septum that was considered to be osseous at L2-L3-L4 levels， which divided the spinal cord in two (Type1 diastematomyelia).\n\n【9】Operation and Postoperative Course\n\n【10】The patient was taken to the operating room for removal of fibrous spur， untethering process， gathering of two hemicords in a single dura.\n\n【11】The lumbar region was opened by including the bone lesion from the skin in the right paramedian region. The bone lesion was followed distally to reveal the location of the dura .The por-tion of the bone lesion up to the dura level was removed. Then the dura was opened at the upper and lower end of the septum. The intradural component of the bone lesion was followed up to the vertebral corpus from which it originated and removed. Arachnoid adhesions were opened. The lower end of the phy-lum was found and loosened by cutting. The dura was then primary sutured. The postoperative condition of the patient was uneventful.\n\n【12】The patient's postoperative MRI examination revealed com-plete removal of the bone spur and fixed tethering. At the first year follow-up of the patient， the wound was clean， the pain had dissappeared and there was no motor deficit\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】SCM is the division of a segment of the spinal cord into two parts with a fibrous or hard bone protrusion. It is a rare typeof neural tube defects  and is most commonly seen in the thoraco-lumbar and lumbar area J.\n\n【15】As there are too many and different definitions for SCMin the literature， or since it is not reported when there is no accom-panying pathology， it is difficult to predict its actual incidence. It was first described and named by Ollivier in 1837 .In1992， Pang et al. used “Type I\" and\"Type II\" terminology in split cord malformation.\n\n【16】The factor that causes diastematomyelia has not been fully explained .\n\n【17】Bremer . reported in 1952 that split was formed in the cord as a result of the persistence of the transient canal and that vertebral and cutaneous anomalies coexisted due to the joint effects of the mesoderm and ectoderm. According to the Unified Theory of Embryogenesis that was reported by Pang et al. in1992， all SCM types have a common embryogenetic mechanism. The formation of an adhesion between the endoderm and ecto-derm leads to an accessory neural-enteric canal that presses the endo-mesenchymal canal， which causes the formation of two hemi-neural plaques dividing the notochord. This is the most widely accepted theory nowadays .\n\n【18】Meningomyelocele， lipoma， teratomas and neuroenteric cysts may be listed as anomalies accompanying SCM . The study conducted by Wang et al. found that SCM is generally seen in children， 70% of patients are female and that the thoracolum-bar area is the most commonly involved site of SCM.\n\n【19】Patients present to medical care facilities with three types of symptoms including skin findings， neurological findings and orthopedic disorders emerged during childhood or infantile period . Frequently， sphincter disorders are also seen in pa-tients . Mahapatra . found that the female-male rate was1.3/1. Bladder and bowel disorders were reported in 28.7% of patients. In the study conducted by Mahapatra in 2011 with300 patients .， skin findings were detected in 60% of patients， and scoliosis or lower extremity deformity were detected in 80%of patient. The growth rates of spinal bones are higher than the growth rates of the spinal cord. Neurological deterioration and deformities may develop in patients due to the failure of the spinal cord to rise caused by the fixation of bone， fibrous or cartilage tissue or the traction of the filum terminale . Some surgeons recommend early or even prophylactic surgeries to avoid neurological deficits . Although it is suggested that neurological deficits may develop because of the formation of ischemia and tissue necrosis in the spinal cord with tension， no strong data are available to support this approach .\n\n【20】In the study of Beuriat et al. ， all patients were neuropsy-chologically normal except for those with meningomyelocele accompanying SCM. Although the spinal cord ends at L5 level in our patient， no neurological deficits has developed. This sup-ports the opinion that SCM patients accompanied by tethered cord who cannot undergo surgery may also be neurologically intact.\n\n【21】Skin symptoms are seen almost in half of the patients. The most common skin finding is hypertrichosis. Among other skin findings， capillary hemangioma， hyperpigmentation， subcuta-neous lipoma， aplasia cutis， hypertrichosis and neuroectodermal skin extensions may be cited . Our patient presented to our clinic because of a mass since birth in her back and pain in both legs. The mass on the back of our patient was osseous exposition. However， this mass did not cause any neurological symptoms until the patient became adult. The patient wanted to get rid of the lesion on the back for cosmetic reasons and painIn the past， it was considered that the bone that caused the split cord should be removed as soon as it was diagnosed be-cause it could cause tension in the spur spinal cord . However， as the pathophysiology of the split cord malformation was bet-ter understood， this approach was abandoned . There is no consensus on the surgical treatment and timing of Type 1 SCM patients who are asymptomatic and neurologically intact .\n\n【22】Usually positive results are reported in patients who undergo surgery. The dorsal spur must be carefully removed during surgery， all structures that cause tension in the spinal cord must be removed， and the spinal cord must be released completely.\n\n【23】Conclusion\n\n【24】Here， we have presented a very rare case. The interesting aspect of this case was that although there were many vertebrae and spinal deformities with SCM， it could not be diagnosed until adulthood as the patient did not have any symptoms until adult-hood except for the bone protrusion in the waist. Our patient was suffering from Type1 SCM， L2-L3-L4-L5 vertebrae fusion caused by tethered cord， dorsal and ventral bone spur. At first， we had some hesitations about the surgery due to the lack of neurological deficits in the patient. However， as we inform the patient about its risks， she still decided to undergo the operation， therefore， we performed it. During the surgery， dorsal spur was removed by performing total laminectomy at these levels as we knew that the bone tissue that emerged from the skin was a formation that reached the skin from the spinous process. Then， removal of ventral fibrous spur， untethering process， gathering of two hemicords in a single dura， in the inferior thoracic cord were performed. Each postoperative condition was uneventful.\n\n【25】Abbreviations\n\n【26】·SCM： Split cord malformation\n\n【27】·MRI： Magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【28】·L： Lumbar (L)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Methods： Prospective observational study conducted at a tertiary care hospital from April 2020 to March2021， 70 cases of clinically suspected dengue within the age group of 6 months to 15 years presenting with fever for less than 5 days underwent whole abdomen and chest ultrasonography. For seropositive cases， ultrasonography findings and their utility in early diagnosis and prediction of disease severity were analyzed along with their correlation to the clinical and laboratory profiles.Results：75.8% had primary dengue， and 24.2% had secondary dengue. 94% of cases demonstrated ultrasonography features suggestive of dengue-like hepatomegaly (81%)， ascites (63.8%)， splenomegaly(56.9%)， gall bladder wall thickness (46.6%)， Cholecystitis (44.8%) and Pleural effusion (41.4%). Ascites and pleural effusion correlated well with clinical severity (p<0.05). Ascites also significantly correlated with increased hematocrit(p=0.040) and thrombocytopenia (p=0). A significant correlation was observed between pleural effusion with decreased platelet count ((p=0.004) and decreased serum sodium levels (p=0.044). Gall bladder wall thickening >5mm correlated well with disease severity. USG showed 94.3% sensitivity， 16.67% specificity and 81.43% of diagnostic accuracy in the seropositive cases of this study. Conclusion： Ultrasonography is useful not only as an adjuvant for early diagnosis of Dengue fever but also as a marker of disease severity.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS dengue， disease severity， early diagnosis， seropositive， ultrasonography\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Dengue is endemic in more than 100 countries， which are in-cluded in the world health organization (WHO) regions. Dengue is deemed second in importance to malaria；the WHO\ncounts Dengue as one of sixteen neglected tropical diseases. Studies show that the sensitivity rate of NS1(Non-structural protein1) antigen is high in primary dengue (97.41%) than in secondary dengue (68.8%). With the availability of ultrasonography， diagnosis of dengue can be made as early as third day which could be lifesaving.Ultrasonogra-phy is an adjunct to clinical profile in the diagnosis of dengue fever\n\n【4】In pandemic situations like the current Covid-19 (Corona virus disease 19) crisis， the feasibility of a non-invasive and relatively simple investigation like USG as an adjunct for early detection and an indication of disease severity can be helpful for time management and， ultimately， reduction in mortality due to dengue.\n\n【5】Methodology\n\n【6】This prospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in South India from April 2020 to March 2021.\n\n【7】Ethical issues：\n\n【8】Approval for the study was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee of Rich Hospitals， Nellore， and Andhra Pradesh， India (NO-RICH/RES/2020/048). Written Informed consent was obtained from the parents of the children included in the study.\n\n【9】Inclusion criteria：\n\n【10】Children between 6 months and 15 years clinically suspected of dengue with a fever of less than 5 days who later proved serologically positive for dengue fever.\n\n【11】Exclusion criteria：\n\n【12】Age less than 6 months and more than 15 years， Clinical and Laboratory profile suggestive of dengue but negative for Im-munoglobulinG (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) serology， Children with Dengue managed as an outpatient， those who refused to join to study and duration of fever more than 5 days.\n\n【13】In this study， for the 70 children who had features sugges-tive of dengue， detailed history of presenting complaints was recorded in a pre-structured proforma. All the children enrolled in this study were subjected to whole abdomen and chest ul-trasonography on the day of presentation to the hospital， and dengue serology IgM and IgG were done after 5 days of fever. Among these cases， 58 who were found to be seropositive under-went laboratory investigation after 5 days of fever. A qualified radiologist used a Toshiba aplio XV ultrasonography machine with a 3.5 MHz curvilinear transducer probe. All children un-derwent laboratory investigations like complete blood count， serum electrolytes， liver function test， dengue serological marker， and chest x-ray(CXR). Based on clinical and laboratory features， these children were classified as per WHO classification 1； for these seropositive cases， abdominal ultrasonography findings and their utility in early diagnosis and prediction of disease severity were analyzed along with their correlation to the clini-cal and laboratory profiles. There were no dropouts in the study population.\n\n【14】Statistical analysis：\n\n【15】This data was statistically analyzed using the SPSS 16.0 and open Epi2.3.1 packages. Various statistical tools/measures like Pearson chi-square test， fisher’s exact chi-square test， sensitivity， specificity， positive predictive value， negative predictive value and diagnostic accuracy were applied to authenticate the result.\n\n【16】Results\n\n【17】In the present study， children aged above 10yrs were the most common age group (36.2%)， while children below lyr were the least affected. Of the 70 children in this study， 58 were seroposi-tive， while 12 were seronegative. In addition， these 12 children had nonspecific USG features like mesenteric lymphadenitis， pancreatic enlargement and liquid within the Morrison’s pouch， which could not be considered indicative of dengue.\n\n【18】Of the 58 children with seropositive dengue， 75.8 % had pri-mary dengue， 24.2% had secondary dengue， and the distributionof the clinical features in the study sample is as given in Table1. 55(94%) cases demonstrated ultrasonography feature sug-gestive of dengue. The ultrasonography findings noted were hepatomegaly (81%)，ascites (63.8%)，splenomegaly (56.9%)， gall-bladder wall thickness (46.6%)， cholecystitis (44.8%) and pleural effusion (41.4%). The vomiting had a significant correlation with ascites & hepatomegaly. Tachypnea had a significant correlation with splenomegaly. USG findings like ascites (p<0.05) and pleu-ral effusion (p<0.05) correlated well with clinical severity . Clinical & ultrasonography features of ascites had signifi-cant correlation. Clinical pleural effusion significantly correlated with ultrasonography features like ascites， pleural effusion， gall bladder wall oedema， cholecystitis and splenomegaly. On com-parison of USG features with laboratory parameters， ascites had a significant correlation with increased hematocrit (p=0.040) and marked significance with (p=0.00) with thrombocytopenia. A significant correlation was observed between pleural effusion with decreased platelet count ((p=0.004) and decreased serum sodium levels (p=0.044). Gall bladder wall thickening had a sig-nificant correlation with increased haemoglobin level (p=0.013)， increased packed cell volume (p=0.021) and decreased platelet count (p=0.005).Gall bladder wall thickening >5mm correlated well with severity\n\n【19】USG showed 94.3% sensitivity， 16.67% specificity and81.43% of diagnostic accuracy in the seropositive cases of this study. \n\n【20】More than 90% of cases had thrombocytopenia， a platelet count of less than 1，500，000. Among this， 31% had less than50000，37.9%had platelets between 50 to 1 lakh， and 2 children had a platelet count of 20000. Platelet count of <1，00，000 had a sensitivity of 63.9% and specificity of 75%. Ultrasonography evidence of plasma leakage was the most sensitive， with 65.52%observed among those having platelet count <1 lakh. Consider ing all factors， platelet count <1 lakh was the best marker， with a diagnostic accuracy of 65.71%， followed by ultrasonography with 62.86% . Ultrasonography evidence of plasma leak-age viz ascites and pleural effusion was compared with other factors such as Packed Cell Volume， platelet count and CXR. When all ultrasonography findings were considered together， the sensitivity was 94.83%， specificity 16.67% and diag-nostic accuracy 81.43% .\n\n【21】Discussion\n\n【22】USG findings in the study population\n\n【23】The present study showed the incidence of hepatomegaly (81%) similar to Balasubramaniam  and Rajib et al.  However， Syed et al. found hepatomegaly only in 30% of cases due to low dengue-positive cases \\[n=. The present study showed the incidence of ascites (63.8%) similar to studies done by Bal-asubramaniam， Motla， Rajib and Venkata Sai  et al. Studies done by Sacharet al. and Thulkar et al. had the highest and lowest percentage of patients with ascites， re-spectively. The incidence of splenomegaly (56.9%) in the present study was the highest among comparable studies， with other studies consistently showing an incidence of <40%. The inci-dence of gallbladder wall thickening in the present study (46.6%) was similar to those undertaken by Wahab， Srikiatchon， Wu and Thulkar  et al.， whereas Venkatasai et al. found gallbladder wall thickening at 100% of cases. Pleural effusion(41.4%) was found in a similar percentage of patients as Wa-hab， Motla，Wu and Thulkar et al. The percentageof patients with pleural effusion was highest in Venkata Sai et al. and lowest in Syed et al. The present study did not observe pericardial effusion， Peri/pararenal fluid collection and hepatic/splenic subscapular fluid collection.

Similarly， clinical evidence of ascites and pleural effusion was found in 7 and 10 patients， respectively， while ultrasonography evidence was seen in 37 and 24 patients. Similar findings were observed in Wahab  et al.\n\n【34】Similarly， USG picked up more cases of pleural effusion than chest X-ray (24 compared to 10)， a trend also observed by Wa-hab15 et al. and Thulkar et al.\n\n【35】Dengue severity\n\n【36】Of the 58 children with seropositive dengue， 75.8 % of the cases had primary dengue， and 24.2% had secondary dengue， which was similar to those found by Syed et al. 18. However， Sriki-atchon and Rajib et al. found the majority had secondary dengue .\n\n【37】Our study comprised 25.9% of severe dengue， similar to dis-ease distribution in studies by Srikiatchon 12 and VekataSai et al. 9 .\n\n【38】Ultrasonography findings like ascites， pleural effusion and gall bladder wall thickening significantly correlated with ab-normal laboratory parameters like low platelets， high packed cell volume， high hemoglobin and low serum sodium showing their implication in disease severity. Gall bladder wall thick-ening >5mm correlated well with severity. The present study also found that the incidence of gallbladder wall thickening， ascites， pleural effusion， hepatomegaly and splenomegaly in-creased with the severity of the disease. This is similar to the findings of Wahab15 et al. and Setiawan et al. How-ever， peri/Para renal fluid collection and hepatic and splenic subscapular fluid collection， described in previous studies as associated with disease severity， were not found in the present study. USG evidence of plasma leakage had the highest sensitiv-ity (65.52%) and specificity (50%) compared to clinical evalua-tion， hematocrit and chest radiography .\n\n【39】Other laboratory parameters did not correlate significantly with ultrasonography finding， hence no implication in disease severity .\n\n【40】Early identification of the suggestive ultrasonography fea-tures and management， including close observation or mon-itoring in pediatric intensive care， may reduce mortality， as suggested by WHO. In the present study， apart from fever(100%)， only a few clinical manifestations were observed un-der dengue with /without warning sign classification based on the world health organization in the early stage of the disease. However， ultrasonography identified more dengue cases with/without warning signs， as shown in . Almost15(25.9%) cases of severe dengue，31(53.4%) cases of dengue with warning signs and 12(20.7%) cases of dengue without warning signs were predominantly identified with ultrasonography in less than five days. In this study， only one case of shock and seizure manifestation was reported； based on the ultrasonog-raphy report， these children were closely monitored， and all children recovered without morbidity and mortality.\n\n【41】Limitations of the study include that it is a single centre-based study where the study population may not represent the entirecommunity. Therefore， it warrants further community-based studies， including pediatric Covid cases.\n\n【42】Conclusion\n\n【43】It can be concluded that ultrasonography is an important ad-juvant to clinical profile in diagnosing dengue， especially in underdeveloped and developing areas which are endemic with less availability of serological studies and also in Pandemic sit-uations， such as in the present ongoing COVID-19 and Mul-tisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C)， where dengue fever is a differential diagnosis， where a noninvasive in-vestigation like ultrasonography can help to clinch the diagnosis. Therefore it can be concluded that not only ultrasonography is useful as an adjuvant to early diagnosis of Dengue fever where the serologic diagnostic facility is not readily available but also as a marker of disease severity. Early diagnosis of dengue features by ultrasonography helps prioritise the management modality， thus decreasing the mortality rates.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Pathogenesis of leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) most frequently includes infection， immunological agents and drugs. A third-generation cephalosporin cefotaxime induced LCV has not been reported before in the literature.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A51 years old male patient admitted for decompensated cirrhosis to our gastroenterology clinic with complaints of abdominal distention and pretibial edema. He had low-grade fever so cefotaxime treatment was administered three times l g in a day intravenously. In seventh day of antibiotic therapy， skin rashes were occurred on lower extremities. After cefotaxime therapy was stopped skin rashes were disappeared on forth day. According to the Naranjo probability scale， the vasculitis experienced by our patient was probably due to cetotaxime.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】Drug induced LCV usually occurs after seventh day of treatment. Lesions usually disappear in a little time after drugs are stopped. In our case skin rashes were disappeared on forth day after cefotaxime therapy has been discontinued. So we thought cefotaxime caused to LCV lesions.\n\n【6】Key words： leukocytoclastic vasculitis · cefotaxime · drug induced vasculitis · alcoholic cirrhosisThe pathogenesis of leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) is still unknown . Most of the associated factors were infectious agents (streptococci， hepatitis virus)， immunological agents (rheumatoid factor， cryoglobu-lin) or drugs known to be potential LV-inductors； other factors were less common or quite recently described (enterovirus， Yersiniae， cirrhosis， primary liver cancer， Chlamydia， refractory anemia with an excess of myeloblasts . We report clinical and laboratory features， treatment， and outcome of one male patient with drug induced LCV.\n\n【7】was medium. He had icterus on his skin and sclera. His skin and conjunctiva were colorless. Pulmonary auscultation revealed rhoncus in the middle and lower zone of left lung and he had tachypnea. Abdominal examination revealed tense ascites and splenomegaly which was palpated 4-5 cm. Anorectal examination revealed grade 3 painful hemorrhoids.\n\n【8】CASE REPORT\n\n【9】In the laboratory results： Hemoglobin was 8.2 g/dl(normal： 13-15)， platelets were 235.000， leucocytes count was 7.400， AST was 42 U/L (normal：10-40)， ALT was 13 U/L， GGT was 14 U/L， ALP was 83 U/L， fasting blood glucose was 97 mg/dL， sodium was130 mmol/L， erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 8， C-reactive protein was 94.6 (normal：0-3.02)，AFP was1.07， hepatitis B surface antigen was negative， and anti hepatitis B Antibody was positive.\n\n【10】Fifty one years old， male patient presented with complaints of abdominal distention， pretibial edema， generalize pruritus and hematochezia. He had his-tory of alcohol consumption (350 cc/day alcohol and2 L/week wine) for 35 years， but he has not drunk in last 6 weeks. He had been diagnosed of alcoholic cirrhosis (ALC) 4 months ago. When he admitted to emergency service， in physical examination； Blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg， pulse rate was 108 and body temperature was 37.5°C. General health statusThe patient was hospitalized to our gastroenterology service with diagnose of ALC. Because of tachypnea and fever paracentesis was performed. Leucocytes were300 in ascites and 60 of them were polymorphonuclear leucocytes. Ascites fluid albumin was 0.2 g and total protein was 0.4 g. Serum ascites albumin gradient was2.1. The patient’s fever was 37.5 C so cefotaxime sodium was administered as 3x1 g/day intravenously.\n\n【11】Endoscopic examination showed esophageal varices， esophageal moniliasis and pangastritis. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed increased liver parenchyma echogenity. Intra hepatic and extra hepatic bile ducts were normal. Spleen was 150x 83 cm.\n\n【12】The patient’s fever was not increased after first dose of cefotaxime treatment. On seventh day of cefo-taxime therapy palpable purpura has occurred which was reaching 0.5-1 cm and was not disappearing with touch . Then as ascites culture was negative and fever was not continued， cefotaxime therapy was stopped on seventh day.\n\n【13】First day of skin rush， new lesions developed on lover extremities and sacrum. Skin biopsy was per-formed. Drug induced LCV was thought and anti-biotic therapy was stopped. On second day skin rash was diminished and on forth day it was disappeared completely. Skin biopsy showed LCV. The patient’s general health status was good and he was discharged from hospital.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n\n【15】Vasculitis is simply inflammation directed at blood vessels identified by histological examination. When blood vessel inflammation occurs， vessel wall destruc-tion with hemorrhage and aneurysm formation or stenosis due to intimal hyperplasia can occur， both of which may lead to tissue ischemia and infarc-tion. Vasculitis can be a primary process (no known cause or association)， or a phenomenon secondary to drug ingestion， infection， or the presence of a sys-temic disease (eg， rheumatoid arthritis) or to local factor such as trauma . In addition to infectious， drug， and systemic and chronic disease associations， epidemiologic studies on vasculitis have implicated geographic， genetic， and environmental factors in the risk for vasculitis . The onset of vasculitis after exposure to a trigger such as a drug or infection is 7to 10 days . Lack of resolution of the lesion after drug discontinuation does not exclude a diagnosis of drug-induced vasculitis， as most， but not all， lesions resolve with drug withdrawal .\n\n【16】For patients with cutaneous vasculitis secondary to systemic disease， the interval between the onset ofsymptoms and signs of the systemic disease can vary from days to years， mean of 6 months， before the on-set of cutaneous vasculitis .Our patient had been diagnosed of ALC 4 months ego. His ALC period was shorter than 6 months， and at follow up for 6 months skin rushes were not seen again. So we considered LCV did not occur due to cirrhosis.\n\n【17】LVC due to infection occurs after seventh day . Our patient had 37.5 C fever on admission and it was continued only two hours. White blood cells of ascites were 300 and 60 of them were polimorpho nuclear leucocytes. Although this value was thought us poor possibility of infection， as our patient was immune suppressive， cefotaxime was administered. As LCV lesions were disappeared on forth day of discontinuation of antibiotic therapy and two ascites fluid cultures were negative we considered skin rushes were not associated with infection.\n\n【18】LCV due to drugs occurs on seventh day of treat-ment， after stopped drugs lesions disappear in a short time . Totan and Islek reported LCV with sefprozil treatment . Islek et al reported a 13 year old girl with appendicitis developed hypersensitivity vasculitis on the fifth day of cefoperazone/sulbactam therapy. Their case of hypersensitivity vasculitis reso LyPCIlved gradually after removal of the agent on the seventh day and was not recur . Gavura and Nusinowitz reported a patient used clarithromycin because of pneumonia. LCV developed at sixty day in therapy of clarithromycin . Feriozzi et al reported cepho-taxime associated allergic interstitial nephritis and MPO-ANCA positive vasculitis . In our patient LCV was occurred on seventh day of cefotaxime therapy and lesions were diminished on second day and were disappeared on forth day of discontinuation of cefotaxime. According to the Naranjo probability scale ， the vasculitis experienced by our patient was probably due to cefotaxime. We thought LCV lesions were occurred due to cefotaxime.\n\n【19】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【20】Drug induced LCV usually occurs on seventh day of drug treatment. Lesions disappear in a short time after discontinuation of drug. As in this case LCV may occur with cefotaxime therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

However， this is not always the case where the radiological confir-mation suggests the occurrence of nonaneurysmal perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n\n【6】MeSH Keywords：\n\n【7】Cerebral Hemorrhage· Headache·Neuroimaging· Sinus Thrombosis， Intracranial·Subarachnoid Hemorrhage·ThrombosisCerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is an uncommon dis-ease with a high morbidity rate that has been increasing in frequency with multiple nonspecific symptoms and presenta-tions. Due to the involvement of multiple sinuses， a vast range of symptoms is observed in patients with CVST. These include headaches， seizures， lethargy， focal neurological deficits， and confusion . Acute spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage(SAH) signifies a vascular origin. The most common cause of spontaneous SAH is ruptured cerebral arterial aneurysm . Alternatively， nonaneurysmal perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage (PNSAH) presents as a distinct etiology from an-eurysmal rupture wherein the hemorrhage is centered ante-rior to the midbrain and leading towards prepontine and su-prasellar cisterns. Therefore， PNSAH is most likely associated with CVST due to close proximity.However， patients with CVST and clinical symptoms of PNSAH are rarely reported .\n\n【8】Likewise， subarachnoid hemorrhage is rarely the first presen-tation of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis . The diagno-sis of CVST manifesting with SAH demands a high index of clinical suspicion along with radiological confirmation to initi-ate treatment as early as possible to avoid the resultant mor-bidity. Therefore， other differential diagnoses such as the lo-cation of hemorrhage， the presence of an aneurysm， and the basilar artery dissection need to be verified. Hence，neuroim-aging via radiological confirmation and differentiation are the cornerstones in CVST diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【9】Here， we describe a case of CVST manifesting initially as PNSAH. The main objective of this report is to further highlight the fact of PNSAH manifestation in the context of CVST， and the role of neuroimaging in confirming the diagnosis.\n\n【10】Case Report\n\n【11】A 44-year-old woman developed sudden onset of a severe headache and presented at our Emergency Department with no history of trauma， coagulation disorders， or allergies. She reported no history of oral contraceptive use， or misuse of al-cohol， cigarettes， and drugs. Upon examination， the patient was noted to have papilledema， impaired pupillary light re-flex， neck rigidity with decreased range of motion， and marked weakness of the right upper and lower limbs. The patient was alert， with a blood pressure of 130/70， heart rate of 61， respi-ratory rate of 15， temperature of 36.8℃， and 99% oxygen sat-uration on room air. Pulmonary examination and EKG were re-corded as normal. The initial Glasgow coma scale 11/15 upon presentation and the level of consciousness deteriorated to9/15 in a few hours.\n\n【12】All initial laboratory results were normal， including complete blood count test results and coagulation profile. Comprehensive hypercoagulability tests of proteins C and S， fibrinogen， an-tithrombin IIl， antiphospholipid antibody， anticardiolipin an-tibody， and homocysteine were performed， and all findings were within normal limits.\n\n【13】The magnetic resonance arteriogram and venogram were done first， as CT angiography was not available at the time. The di-agnosis presented a reassessment of the cerebral venous si-nuses， which showed evidence of a filling defect in the left transverse sinus and an internal jugular vein， in addition to hyperdensity in the right prepontine and suprasellar cisterns. Moreover， the brain magnetic resonance imag-ing scan indicated the presence of parenchymal microbleed-ing in the midbrain . Accordingly， the patient was immediately started on a dose-adjusted intravenous antico-agulation therapy. Low molecular weight heparin (Nadroparin，6150AXalU， subcutaneous injection， twice daily) in combina-tion with intravenous warfarin 3 mg/day to maintain a tar-get international normalization ratio of 2.5. The clinical symp-toms of the patient gradually improved over the next week.\n\n【14】Three days after the patient was admitted， a non-contrast brain computed tomography (CT) scan was performed， which showed an ill-defined hyperdense area in the prepontine cis-tern signifying SAH . The results obtained in the ini-tial and follow-up CT confirmed the exclusion of basilar artery dissection and arterial aneurysm as a cause of SAH ； therefore， a lumbar puncture was not performed. The cere-bral angiogram showed a moderate filling defect along the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses， verifying the diagnosis of CVST made by the radiologist.\n\n【15】The patient continued to improve over the next 2 weeks with the resolution of her neurological symptoms. She was dis-charged without any neurological deficit after 2 weeks of hos-pital stay. She was switched to an oral warfarin with an INR target of 2-3 for 3 months while following up as an outpatient.\n\n【16】Further laboratory testing was commenced to determine the un-derlying etiology， and all tests were negative， including thrombo-philia workup. Magnetic resonance arteriography and venogra-phy were repeated at 1 month after discharge， and the images showed complete recanalization of both the left transverse si-nus and internal jugular vein. Currently， the patient is no longer taking anticoagulants and is free of any neurological symptoms.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】10% of cases are associated with nonaneurysmal hemorrhage presenting a negative angiogram for a saccular aneurysm . Accordingly， nonaneurysmal perimesencephalic hemorrhage portrays a distinct radiographic pattern confined to hemor-rhage at the anterior of the midbrain or pons where blood may extend to the brainstem， proximal Sylvian fissures， or into a suprasellar cistern . Since the CT imaging of blood patternsrepresented by nonaneurysmal subarachnoid are distributed in the perimesencephalic region， they can be described as a distinct clinical entity with an excellent prognosis， a benign clinical course， and minimal risk of rebleeding .Because aneurysmal ruptures are rarely associated with PNSAH like bleeding patterns， full cerebral angiography is recommended by radiologists to avoid missing any vascular malformations or vertebrobasilar aneurysms. If the angiography is negative， hemorrhage bleeding in the initial CT scan is essential to es-tablish a perimesencephalic pattern .\n\n【19】PNSAH caused by CVST presentation is still considered rare， and not all emergency physicians and neuroradiologists are fa-miliar with it .CVST is a difficult clinical diagnosis to make and requires radiological evidence to confirm due to its wide range of clinical presentations. The most commonly associat-ed symptoms are usually progressive and indolent headaches， a decrease in the level of consciousness， focal seizures， and focal motor and sensory deficits . The most commonly af-fected cerebral venous sinuses are the lateral， superior sagit-tal， transverse， and straight sinuses . Even though the inci-dence of CVST manifesting as isolated SAH is very low， reaching6.4%， researchers have previously reported the associa-tion of sinus thrombosis with dilation of the cortical veins that may rupture and cause bleeding in the subarachnoid space， re-sulting in SAH . The most accepted hypothesis is that theorigin of PNSAH is a venous pathology of straight sinus steno-sis， in which jugular vein occlusion may present as a contrib-uting factor to PNSAH. These arguments provide further sup port for CVST as a venous source of PNSAH .\n\n【20】The case we described here had typical symptoms of SAH， in-cluding a severe headache， neck stiffness， and motor weak-ness， and imaging evidence of SAH simulating a ruptured ar-terial aneurysm. Thus， establishing the diagnosis of CVST can be more difficult in the presence of SAH clinically.\n\n【21】The precise underlying pathophysiology of SAH caused by CVST remains undetermined， but multiple theories have been pre-sented by clinicians in accordance with their correlation. For instance， an increase in the vascular permeability due to the local inflammatory response may lead to blood extravasation to the subarachnoid space . Another theory indicates the development of venous parenchymal hemorrhagic infarcts lead-ing to rupture of veins in the subarachnoid space . Finally， sinus thrombosis extension into the superficial cortical veins may have induced venous hypertension and eventual rupture into the subarachnoid space .\n\n【22】In this case study， the most suitable pathophysiology is the first and second theory， in which radiological findings were consistent with the presence of blood in multiple subarachnoid cisterns， along with evidence of microbleeding in the midbrain， which suggests the diagnosis of PNSAH. The parenchymal microbleed-ing in the midbrain spreading towards a suprasellar cistern and the right Sylvian fissures also explain the manifestation of motor weakness in the patient . On the other hand， the final theory implies the presence of SAH confined to the cere bral convexities only， without the involvement of the subarach-noid cisterns， which does not relate to our case. Appropriately， most case reports support the second and third theories， as most cases of SAH caused by CVST are found to have bleeding confined to the cerebral convexities， sparing the basal cistern.\n\n【23】In addition， basilar artery dissection is a very important dif-ferential diagnosis in cases of PNSAH with involvement of the prepontine cistern， as in this case. It is a life-threatening condition that needs to be excluded whenever there is a non-aneurysmal SAH because it requires prompt neurosurgicalinterventions . Accordingly， Figure 7 presents evidence towards the absence of an arterial aneurysm and PNSAH-like bleeding patterns.\n\n【24】Moreover， the difference in the radiological appearance of CVST and SAH from the aneurysmal arterial origin is the most im-portant differentiating factor between these 2 conditions . Localized SAH is usually confined to the dorsolateral and para-sagittal cerebral convexities， sparing the basal cistern . These findings should prompt physicians to search for non-aneurysmal causes for PNSAH such as CVST， which requires additional vascular imaging， including magnetic resonance ar-teriography and venography， to characterize the patterns of extravasated blood. As in our case， CT arteriography， magnetic resonance arteriography， magnetic resonance venography，and conventional cerebral angiography were performed rapidly， and imaging studies confirmed the absence of arterial aneurysms and the presence of CVST. Due to this pathological assumption of PNSAH， anticoagulation therapy is most likely to be effec-tive to prevent rebleeding and vasospasm. However，standard anticoagulation dosing parameters， initiation time， and moni-toring protocols are not well established， which makes the in-tervention for PNSAH induced by CVST slightly more compli-cated . This allowed us to commence the administration of dose-adjusted anticoagulation therapy early during the treat-ment course and improve the patients' prognosis of PNSAH， even though the morbidity rate of CVST is considered high.\n\n【25】Conclusions\n\n【26】CVST can be difficult to diagnose due to a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms， especially in the presence of acute SAH. Although SAH caused by CVST has been reported to be con-fined to cerebral convexities， the involvement of subarach-noid cisterns， including the basal cistern， as well as midbrain， should raise the index of suspicion for PNSAH to CVST after excluding arterial cerebral aneurysms and basilar artery dis-section via neuroradiological characteristics. The present case report， combined with the underlying radiological distinction of PNSAH induced by CVST， which is a rare presentation of CVST， provides a better understanding of the differential diagnosis and prompt management of PNSAH in the context of CVST.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Complications can occur due to the torsion of the splenic vascular pedicle， resulting in symptoms ranging from an incidental finding to an acute abdomen as a result of an ischemic ne-crosis of the spleen.\n\n【2】Case Report： We present the case of a 25-year-old female patient who presented with a recurring abdominal pain associ-ated with serum lipase and C-reactive protein elevation. The computed tomography scan revealed torsion of the splenic pedicle and hypoperfusion of the spleen. A surgical exploration was performed and a wandering spleen was diagnosed perioperatively. It was characterized by the lack of peritoneal ligaments， thus resulting in a splenic volvulus. A splenectomy was carried out due to the definite ischemic necrosis of the spleen.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】The diagnosis of this rare condition can be very challenging since it can be presented with a vast variety of symptoms， mimicking other abdominal pathologies. The intermittent nature of an ultimate splenic torsion can add to the diagnostic challenge. Medical literature concerning the wandering spleen and knowledge about this pathology originates mainly from individual case reports. Despite the evolving diagnostic modalities available， this rare and ambiguous disorder remains misdiagnosed， and a high index of suspicion is needed for the ap-propriate diagnosis to be established.\n\n【5】MeSH Keywords： Abdominal Pain· Splenectomy· Splenic Infarction · Wandering SpleenWandering spleen is a rare condition in which the loss or weak-ening of one or more ligaments of the spleen leads to the or-gan's increased mobility and instability . An important se quela of this excessive mobilization is torsion of the splenic vascular pedicle， which ultimately causes necrosis of the pa-renchyma. The etiology of this uncommon disorder can be congenital or acquired. The rarity of this disease， as well as the non-specific nature of its clinical presentation， make the wandering spleen an elusive diagnosis. We present a case of a young woman， initially diagnosed with acute pancreatitis，who presented a torsion of the splenic vessels due to the absence of the splenocolic and splenophrenic ligaments.\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】A 25-year-old female patient， with a medical history of depres-sion under neuroleptic treatment， was investigated in the emer-gency department of our institution for an epigastric pain asso-ciated with several episodes of vomiting. The onset of symptoms was gradual， with a duration of several days and progressive worsening. Ultimately， abdominal pain exacerbation resulted in the patient's consultation in the emergency department.\n\n【8】Initial physical examination revealed an epigastric pain with-out rebound tenderness， and laboratory evaluation showed normal laboratory inflammatory markers. As a result of the reassuring clinical examination and laboratory values，the pa-tient was discharged.\n\n【9】The following day， a scheduled medical re-evaluation revealed an ongoing abdominal pain with elevated lipase and C-reactive protein on laboratory testing. At this point， a drug-induced pancreatitis was suspected due to the patient's neuroleptic treatment， and she was hospitalized. Further investigations in the form of an abdominal ultrasound excluded a biliary cause of pancreatitis. However， the examination identified a sple-nomegaly as well as a small quantity of peritoneal effusion.\n\n【10】The findings of the abdominal ultrasound and the persistence of the patient's symptoms dictated that we conduct of an ab-dominal/pelvic computed tomography scan. The examination confirmed the presence of a splenomegaly and demonstrat-ed hypoperfusion of the enlarged spleen due to a volvulus of its vascular pedicle . At this point， a splenic volvu-lus was suspected， and the patient was transferred to our de-partment of General Surgery. An exploratory laparotomy was conducted the following day. A torsion of the splenic vascu-lar pedicle was discovered， secondary to the absence of the splenocolic and splenophrenic ligaments， therefore establish-ing the diagnosis of a wandering spleen.\n\n【11】After the detorsion of the vascular pedicle， the spleen remained necrotic， showing no signs of recuperation. A thrombosis of the splenic pedicle was suspected and a splenectomy was car-ried out . The operation was successful， without any perioperative complications.\n\n【12】The final histopathology report documented a thrombosis of the splenic artery and vein associated with hemorrhagic necrosisof the splenic parenchyma. The patient had an uneventfulre-covery and was discharged 7 days after surgery.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Wandering spleen is a condition characterized by the increased laxity or total absence of the splenic ligaments and subsequent failure of the spleen to maintain orthotopic position， predis-posing it to increased motility and even migration to unusual intra-abdominal or pelvic loci. Secondary to this phenome-non is the elongation of the spleen's vascular pedicle， which acts as an axon and， prone to torsion， results in hypoperfu-sion of the splenic parenchyma， congestion， thrombosis， and ultimately infarction and necrosis of the spleen. A number of peritoneal attachments keep the spleen in its proper anatomic position， the most constant and clinically important being the splenogastric ligament， which contains the short gastric ves-sels. The others are the splenocolic ligament， splenophrenic ligament， splenoomental ligament， and splenorenal ligament， which envelops the hilar vessels . In our patient's case， we identified the complete absence of the splenocolic and sple-nophrenic ligaments.\n\n【15】The etiology of this disorder may be congenital or acquired. While the pathophysiologic mechanism of congenital wan-dering spleen remains unknown， most studies in the medi-cal literature associate it with the faulty development of the mesogastrium dorsum during embryonic life. Related acquired conditions include splenomegaly， history of intra-abdominal trauma， and pregnancy .\n\n【16】Whether congenital or acquired， wandering spleen is a rare dis-order with an unknown incidence rate， as fewer than 500 cases have been reported in the literature to date. Despite the lack of ample statistical data， a bimodal incidence may be suggestedby the current evidence， further favoring both congenital and acquired etiologies. Up to one-third of all cases appear to be children， with 30% being under 10 years old. The male to fe male ratio is 1： 1 in this population. The second peak in inci-dence occurs between 20 and 40 years， with the male to fe male ratio changing to 1： 7， potentially further enhancing the association of wandering spleen with pregnancy .\n\n【17】The clinical presentation of wandering spleen may vary from chronic， mild abdominal discomfort caused by intermittent vascular torsion to acute abdomen caused by splenic infarc-tion. An asymptomatic abdominal mass may also be the sole manifestation of the disease.Other infrequent conditions as-sociated with a wandering spleen are gastric volvulus， varice-al hemorrhage， and acute pancreatitis， due to affliction of the pancreatic tail confined to the lienorenal ligament . Our patient presented with acute epigastric pain and elevated lev-els of lipase and C-reactive protein， findings compatible with the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.\n\n【18】As clinical presentation and laboratory studies are nonspe-cific， imaging examinations form the basis of diagnosis. Ultrasonography and computed tomography are of use， offering the additional advantage of controlling blood flow . Radio-isotopic study by Te99 can also be used to evaluate spleen func-tion， although its availability is limited compared to conven-tional imaging techniques. Owing to the limited availability of data， there has been no conclusion drawn on the superiority of each imaging technique concerning sensitivity and speci-ficity . In our case， the abdominal ultrasound revealed an enlarged spleen and pathologicintra-abdominal effusion with-out other abnormalities， while the vascular torsion and hypo-perfusion of the spleen were evident in the subsequent com-puted tomography scan.\n\n【19】Surgical treatment appears to be the optimal strategy in cas-es of a wandering spleen. When feasible， preservation of the spleen should be encouraged. The physiological importance of the spleen is well established since it is an important part of the reticulo-endothelial system and plays a vital role in anti-gen clearance， particularly in encapsulated organisms such as\n\n【20】Pneumococcus， Meningococcus and Haemophilus influenza .\n\n【21】Splenopexy， either open or laparoscopic， is a spleen preserv-ing technique that can be employed in the absence of infarc-tion or abundant splenomegaly， precluding spleen mobiliza-tion. Multiple techniques have been described， with fixation of the spleen by absorbable sutures or by absorbable mesh placement . No technique has shown superiority con-cerning long-term results.\n\n【22】In cases where spleen preservation is not an option because of lack of viable spleen parenchyma， splenectomy appears to be the only solution. Both open and laparoscopic approachesappear to be safe. Although reports of nonoperative treatment exist， it is not recommended，especially in the absence of im-portant contraindications for surgery， because the risk of an impending abdominal catastrophe remains high.\n\n【23】Conclusions\n\n【24】Wandering spleen remains a rare condition with nonspecific presentation ranging from a mild， chronic discomfort to an acute abdomen. Despite the diagnostic modalities available，a high index of clinical suspicion is necessary for diagnosis. Surgical treatment is encouraged with spleen preservation techniques such as splenopexy， the preferable option if the spleen is viable and patient status allows such intervention. In our case， we opted for an open splenectomy owing to the extensive necrosis of the spleen parenchyma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Approximately two-thirds of chil-dren with primary ITP have a history of viral infection during the previous month . Viruses commonly identified as trig-gers of ITP include cytomegalovirus， hepatitis C， herpes， vari-cella-zoster， Epstein-Barr， influenza， and HIV . ITP is a po-tential presentation of COVID-19. Tsao et al reported the case of a 10-year-old girl who had ITP and a positive reverse tran-scriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result for se-vere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 viral testing should be considered in these patients to allow for appropriate hospital triaging and isolation to lim-it community spread and healthcare worker infection during pandemics. We report the case of an infant with ITP that was likely caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【7】A 9-month-old boy， weighing 8.5 kg， came to the hospital with petechiae on the forehead， cheeks， mouth， and extremities. He had rhinorrhea for 3 days previously and was febrile， pale， weak， and could not drink. The patient had the measles-rubella vac-cination 19 days prior.

The patient was treated with 30 mg/kg body weight/day of intravenous (I) methylprednisolone for 3days (250 mg)， and then 20 mg/kg body weight/day (175 mg) oral methylprednisolone for 4 days in 3 divided doses. The pa-tient was also given azithromycin 100 mg/day， zinc 20 mg/day， vitamin C 50 mg/day. The patient's skin petechiae appearance can be seen in Figure 1. The chest X-ray showed mild right up-per-lobe opacity， as shown in Figure 2.\n\n【11】On day 2 of treatment， the initial RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was performed， and the result was positive， confirming COVID-19. The results of routine blood tests， including com-plete blood count and blood chemistry on days 2， 4， and 16， are shown in Table 1. After 2 IV administrations of 250 mg methylprednisolone， the platelet count was 82 000/uL.The pa-tient's condition improved， and the petechiae were significant-ly reduced. On day 4 of treatment， the second RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was negative. Because the patient’s condition was good and the petechiae were gone， the patient was discharged. The patient went home with oral methylprednisolone and did not undergo tapering of methylprednisolone. Nine days after stopping methylprednisolone (day 16)， the patient's condition was stable. There were no signs of corticosteroid side effects such as “moon face\"， and the platelet count was 181 000/uL. The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio was 0.42.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】According to the course of the disease， ITP in children is divid-ed into 3 types： 1) newly diagnosed， with diagnosis within 3months， accounting for 50% of cases； 2) persistent ITP， within3 to 12 months from diagnosis， accounting for 25% of cases； and 3) chronic ITP， more than 12 months from diagnosis .\n\n【14】ITP most commonly occurs in children 2 to 7 years of age . The incidence of pediatric ITP is 4.3 per 100 000 children per year， and in children aged 2 to 5 years， the incidence is high-er in boys than in girls . This disease is rarely found in in-fants less than 1 year old， probably because of the immature baby's immune system. In general， there is always a history of viral infection of the upper respiratory tract or gastrointes-tinal system or immunizations 2 to 4 weeks before diagnosis. In a study including 257 pediatric patients with ITP，Yong et al reported a history of infection in 20.2% of patients and immunization in 8.6% . In comparison， Hashemi et al report-ed a history of the common cold in 47% of cases and a his-tory of immunization in 25.8% . In the present case， the patient was febrile and had rhinorrhea for 3 days previously. Also， the rapid antibody test was reactive for IgG and nonre-active for IgM， and the positive RT-PCR test for SARS-COV-2meant the patient was in the late or recurrent stage of infec-tion. Therefore， ITP was triggered by SARS-COV-2 infection and was not related to the patient’s immunization history. However， ITP could have been associated with the patient's immuniza-tion history and， at the same time， the patient had COVID-19.\n\n【15】Bleeding often occurs with a platelet count <20 000/uL. Purpuric， mucosal， and intracranial hemorrhage was found in 83.3%， 40.95%， and 3% of cases， respectively . A to tal of 80% of children with ITP who have acute bleeding will recover within days or weeks with or without treatment and will recover within 6 months. The platelet count will return to normal (>150 000/uL) in 50% of cases within 1 to 3 months and in 60% to 75% of cases within 6 months of the onset of thrombocytopenia . In the present case， the patient pre-sented with petechial bleeding， was febrile for 3 days previ-ously， was weak， and could not drink. The complete blood count results showed a platelet count of 16 000/uL and the peripheral blood smear showed few platelets. The rapid an-tibody test result was reactive for IgG and was nonreactive for IgM. A chest X-ray showed pneumonia. This situation was an emergency because platelet counts of only 16 000/uL in-dicate a high risk of intracranial bleeding. Intracranial bleed-ing is rare， occurring in only 0.5% to 1.0% of cases when the platelet count is <10 000/uL ； however， this risk should be considered. In emergency cases， intravenous immunoglob-ulin (IVIG) can be given； however， it is expensive (the family in this case could not afford it)， and therefore a megadose of methylprednisolone， which is inexpensive， was given instead of the usual dosage. A 30 mg/kg body weight/day dosage of methylprednisolone was given for 3 days and then 20 mg/kg body weight/day was given for 4 days. Albayrak et al report-ed no significant differences in ITP treatment to achieve nor-mal platelet values with either IVIG 0.5 g/kg body weight/day for 5 days or methylprednisolone 50 mg/kg body weight/day for 7 days or methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg body weight/day for 7 days . Our patient's condition was improving with the megadose of methylprednisolone. On day 2 of treatment， the platelet count rose to 82 000/uL. On day 4， it was 315000/uL， and the petechiae disappeared. To discharge the pa-tient on day 4 of treatment， the second RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was performed， and the result was negative. The pa-tient went home in good condition. In the present case， there was no tapering of methylprednisolone， and it was shown that9 days after the methylprednisolone was stopped， the plate-let count was 181 000/uL and there were no signs of bleed-ing. In 2 weeks， remission was achieved.\n\n【16】The course of COVID-19 in children is generally mild and has better outcomes overall compared with that of adults . Fever， cough， and sore throat are the most frequent symp-toms . Research in China of 2143 children with sus-pected COVID-19 showed that the proportions of severe and critical cases by age group were 10.6% for <1 year， 7.3% for1 to 5 years， 4.2% for 6 to 10 years， 4.1% for 11 to 15 years， and 3.0% for 216 years . The hematological profile of an infant or child with COVID-19 is not specific. Several studies have shown the presence of leukopenia ， leukocytosis ， or normal leukocyte counts . Henry et al reportedthat leukocytes were not an indicator of the disease's sever-ity . Other reports have shown that neutropenia is most common . Generally， lymphocytosis has been found in in-fants . Kosmeri et al stated that platelets are generally nor-mal in children with COVID-19 .Ambike and Bijarniya stated that thrombocytopenia is rare in children with COVID-19 ， but Kharoud et al and Yarali et al reported that there is also thrombocytosis in children with COVID-19. Inflammatory biomarkers are usually increased，such as the ESR . Pediatric patients with COVID-19 also showed an increase in AST and ALT . In some cases， there was an increase in ESR， AST， ALT， and lymphocytosis . Even though our patient had not shown signs of difficulty breathing， the patient was fe-brile， the ESR was increased， the chest X-ray showed pneu-monia， and the PCR test was positive； therefore， we gave the patient azithromycin. According to the Indonesian COVID-19management protocol， children with pneumonia and a pos-itive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 should be given azithromycin， corticosteroid， vitamin C， and zinc . Vitamin C and zinc had been given to increase the immune system of the child .\n\n【17】The main goal of ITP treatment is not merely to increase the platelet count to an expected value， but is to achieve an ef-fective platelet count to stop bleeding. Generally， if the plate-let count is above 30 000/uL， the clinical experience will be better. In the present case， the platelet increment was sig-nificant even after the methylprednisolone pulse was given only twice. After 4 administrations of methylprednisolone，the platelet count had reached an expected value of 315 000/uL.\n\n【18】At the start of the disease， we cannot differentiate between acute and chronic ITP. In infants with ITP， 9% will have chronic ITP. In children with ITP aged 25 to 119 months， 18% will de-velop chronic ITP， and in children 2120 months with ITP， 47%will develop chronic ITP . Jung et al reported that 85.9%of children with ITP would have remission and 14.1% would have chronic ITP； the prognostic factors for chronic ITP are chil-dren of an older age and the slow appearance of clinical symp-toms . Makis et al reported that the prognostic factors for developing chronic ITP are age >10 years， no previous infection history， longer duration of clinical manifestations， and initial platelet count >10 000/uL . Other investigators reported that the prognostic factors that provided complete remission when ITP was established were a low mean platelet volume level <8 fL and previous infection history . The prognosis of patients with COVID-19 is inadequate if the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio is 23.13 . If the treatment of acute ITP is required， megadose methylprednisolone is the most effective and affordable approach. The chronicity of acute ITP would probably be less with megadose methylprednisolone treat-ment . In the present case， the patient was 9 months old at the time of initial diagnosis of ITP， with a history of illness3 days before presentation， bleeding that appeared suddenly，initial platelet count <20 000/uL， neutrophi. to lymphocyte ratio of 0.42， and complete remission within 2 weeks； there-fore， the prognosis of this patient was good， and he will not develop chronic ITP.\n\n【19】Conclusions\n\n【20】COVID-19 screening is highly recommended during this pan-demic to identify it as a potential cause of childhood ITP. In cases when IVIG is not available or the patient is financially disadvantaged， megadose methylprednisolone can be an ef-fective and inexpensive primary choice. Megadose methyl-prednisolone should be given in the acute phase of ITP to in-crease the platelet count as soon as possible.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

This phe-nomenon has been described in both HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative patients. Although historically es-timated to occur in 6-30% of HIV-seronegative patients with TB， the phenomenon is often under-recognized in the current era， particularly in countries of low TB prevalence. We describe a case of a TB paradoxical reac-tion affecting the CNS and spine in an HIV-seronegative individual who received clinical care in the U.S.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 36-year-old HIV-seronegative refugee from Eritrea presented to the hospital with fever， back pain， and head-ache shortly after arriving to the U.S. He was diagnosed with TB meningitis and Pott’s disease and was started on ATT. He developed worsening clinical symptoms，including headaches， transient diplopia， and mood distur-bances， as well as new radiologic abnormalities in the brain (tuberculomas) and spine (abnormal enhance-ment) despite appropriate ATT. He received prolonged 4-drug ATT and steroids as well as changes in his ATT regimen， and multiple attempts were made to biopsy the brain and spine to address concerns for radiologic changes. Eventually， he was discharged 1 year later with clinical improvement and full neurologic recovery.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】Radiologic and clinical findings due to paradoxical reactions may be unfamiliar to clinicians in countries with low TB prevalence and inadvertently lead to either inadequate management such as the underappreciation of the clinical signs and symptoms indicating potential severity of CNS paradoxical reaction， or conversely overly invasive approaches in a patient who is otherwise clinically improving. Increasing awareness about extrapul-monary paradoxical reactions in such patients is crucial for ensuring appropriate diagnostic approaches and timely clinical management.\n\n【6】MeSH Keywords：\n\n【7】Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome·Tuberculosis， Central Nervous System·Tuberculosis， OsteoarticularA paradoxical reaction (PR) to tuberculosis (TB) is a clinical or radiological worsening of pre-existing tuberculous lesions or the development of new lesions in a patient receiving appro priate anti-tuberculosis therapy (ATT) . Although the exact pathophysiology remains uncertain， it is thought to be due to an exaggerated inflammatory reaction to mycobacterial cell wall antigens in an improving immune system . While such reactions are now commonly reported in human immunodefi-ciency virus (HIV)-seropositive patients starting antiretroviral therapy， the literature has few reports of paradoxical reactions in HIV-seronegative patients， based mostly on anecdotal case reports or small series . These reports have shown that par-adoxical reactions occur in about 6-30% of HIV-seronegative patients who receive ATT \n\n【8】Risk factors for developing paradoxical reactions include dis-seminated disease - defined as multiple sites of TB-and ex-trapulmonary TB， presumably due to greater mycobacterial an-tigen loads . In particular， TB in the central nervous system(CNS) appears to place patients at higher risk for developing paradoxical reactions . Other predictors include low base-line lymphocyte count and an upsurge in lymphocyte count af-ter treatment initiation . Gupta et al. reported that among58 patients with central nervous system (CNS) tuberculosis in India， 10 had paradoxical reactions manifesting as TB menin-gitis and/or tuberculomas on neuroimaging.\n\n【9】Paradoxical reactions may present with or without symptoms. When the CNS is affected， complications can potentially be se-rious because of spatial limitations in the cranium. CNS symp-toms may include headache， mental confusion， focal seizure， cranial nerve palsy， and cortical signs due to enlarging tuber-culomas . While these symptoms may occur during devel-opment of the tuberculomas， overall long-term outcomes are poorly described. One study concluded that the presence of tuberculomas did not significantly affect prognosis . In a series of cases with interval development of tuberculomas or documented enlargement of tuberculomas while on ATT， the majority of patients eventually had clinical improvement， al-though 25% had residual neurological symptoms . Such long-term complications include paraplegia， blindness， or， rare-ly， death . The optimal management of such compli-cations is not yet clear.\n\n【10】In cases of CNS paradoxical reactions， patients received adjunc-tive steroids or additional second-line ATT . Use of corticoste-roids has largely been agreed upon in the literature， particular-ly for patients with symptomatic paradoxical reactions . Surgical management has also been described， including VP shunts and surgical debridement . However， precise guidelines for diagnosis and treatment are not established，making management of this condition challenging， particular-ly for those unfamiliar with paradoxical reactions.\n\n【11】Case Report\n\n【12】A 36-year-old male Eritrean refugee presented to the Emergency Department (ED) complaining of chronic mid-back pain. He had been in a motor vehicle accident 7 years prior， but other-wise did not have any recent history of trauma. He denied fe-vers， chills， or headaches. On exam， he had full strength with flexion and extension， was able to raise his legs off the bed， had normal ambulation， and did not have focal midline back tenderness. No radiologic imaging was obtained. He was dis-charged from the ED with symptomatic management. He pre-sented again to the ED 1 month later with persistent back pain， but this time with fevers and new frontal headache. He de-nied prior or current alcohol or illicit drug use. There was no significant family history. He had no known BCG administra-tion or treatment for latent TB infection. Review of systems did not document recent weight loss.\n\n【13】On admission， his temperature was 38.6℃. His weight was68.04 kg (BMI 23 kg/m)， which was below his ideal body weight of 77 kg. The chest and abdominal exams were nor-mal. There was no nuchal rigidity， but he had vertebral ten-derness at T6 through T8. His neurological exam was other-wise normal. His labs were as follows： WBC 3.9 cells/pl%lymphocytes)\\]； hemoglobin 13.5 g/dl； platelets 194 000/pl； creatinine 0.71 mg/dL； AST 19 p/L；ALT 30 p/L； ESR 25 mm/hr； and albumin 4.6 g/dL. Malaria smear， HIV test， and blood cul-tures were negative.\n\n【14】An MRI spine  showed discitis， osteomyelitis， and a paraspinal abscess at T8-T9. CT-guided aspirate of the ab-scess showed 3+ smear positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Brain MRI (not shown) with contrast showed mildly increased leptomeningeal enhancement along bilateral Sylvian fissures. A lumbar puncture showed the following： opening pressure23 mm of H，O； 137 wbc/mm3 (81% lymphocytes，6% granulo-cytes，13% monocytes)； protein 561 mg/dL； glucose <20 mg/dL； gram stain showed no organisms， and AFB smear was nega-tive. The patient was diagnosed with concomitant Pott’s dis-ease and TB meningitis and was started on steroids (initially60 mg of prednisone for 2 days and then switched to a dexa-methasone taper starting at 15 mg daily) and 4-drug anti-tu-berculosis therapy (ATT) with 600 mg daily of rifampin (RIF)，300 mg daily of isoniazid (INH)， 1500 mg daily of pyrazinamide(PZA)， and 1200 mg daily of ethambutol (ETB).\n\n【15】One month later， the paraspinal aspirate and CSF cultures re-turned with pan-sensitive M. tuberculosis. The patient devel-oped double vision； Ophthalmology was consulted and noteda decrease in visual acuity but no definite changes consistent with optic neuritis， and recommended discontinuation of eth-ambutol. A cranial nerve exam was not recorded. Repeat LP was not performed. Six weeks after diagnosis， he was trans-ferred to our hospital for possible surgical management of spi-nal tuberculosis. During this time， he continued to have back pain and developed mood disturbances， suicidal ideation， persistent headaches， and seizures. Repeat brain MRI using Gadolinium reformat technique (MPRAGE)  showed multiple new temporal lobe intracranial tuberculomas with edema . Repeat CSF analysis showed：373 nucleated cells/pL (59% lymphocytes/41% segs)； protein600 mg/dL； glucose 38 mg/dL； opening pressure was not record-ed； and AFB stain and TB-PCR were negative. An EEG showed no epileptiform activity. Moxifloxacin (400 mg daily) was add-ed as a fourth drug since ethambutol had been stopped. Are-peat spine MRI (not shown) showed mild-moderate collapse of T8-9 and spinal cord compression at multiple levels. A bone biopsy was performed at T8-9， showing chronic osteomyeli-tis with negative AFB stain. He was discharged on the afore-mentioned doses of INH， RIF， PZA， Moxifloxacin， and steroids(dexamethasone 6 mg daily with planned taper). Dosing was modified based on therapeutic drug level monitoring.\n\n【16】He was readmitted 1 day later at an outside hospital due to difficulty obtaining medications from the pharmacy. During a subsequent prolonged hospital stay， a follow-up routine brain MRI (4 months after diagnosis) showed stable but persistentring-enhancing lesions despite documented adherence to 4-drug ATT and steroids. Gamma knife-guided stereotactic brain biop-sy was performed， which showed abundant histiocytes and T cells with negative AFB stain. Brain biopsy cultures were neg-ative. He was discharged to a rehabilitation facility to contin-ue ATT and steroids.\n\n【17】Seven months after his initial diagnosis， he re-presented to the ED with worsening back pain， fall， and recurrent seizure-like activity. An MRl spine showed interval decrease in T8-T9discitis/osteomyelitis， but new subtle enhancement of T5 and T7 along with a new T5 compression fracture . He was transferred back to our hospital due to concern for pro-gressive disease； Interventional Neuroradiology attempted to biopsy T5 but were unsuccessful due to a sclerotic vertebral body. A repeat CSF analysis showed 16 nucleated cells/uL (86%lymphocytes)； protein 54 mg/dL； glucose 47 mg/dl； opening pressure was not recorded； AFB stain， TB-PCR， and AFB cul-tures were negative.\n\n【18】Over the ensuing 5 months， the patient remained in the hos-pital and was noted to have seizures thought to be consistent with psychogenic non-epileptic type (pseudoseizures)； none-theless， he was prescribed anti-seizure medications due to the intracranial masses seen on neuro-imaging. Eight months after original presentation， his ATT was simplified to INH 300 mg dai-ly and RIF 600 mg daily. In total， the patient spent 1 year as an inpatient， ultimately completing 12 months of ATT： 8 monthsof 4-drug therapy followed by 4 months of INH and RIF. He re-ceived 10 months of steroids， with doses of dexamethasone ranging from 0.5 mg every other day to 15 mg daily of dexa-methasone. Periods of tapering were interspersed throughout his complicated hospital course. He had an overall 10-kg weight gain and his headaches and pseudoseizures resolved and he had no focal neurologic deficits. He remained depressed due to his prolonged hospital stay. Two months after completing therapy and an almost year-long hospitalization， he was seen in the clinic and noted to be healthy and to have significant-ly improved mood.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】Prior studies have discussed paradoxical reactions in HIV-seronegative patients with pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB， particularly in cases of TB meningitis .Our patient was originally diagnosed with TB meningitis， and follow-up MRl af-ter 1.5 months of ATT showed new tuberculomas ， the most frequently reported paradoxical reaction (PR) noted on imaging studies . While tuberculomas may be asymptom-atic and present as an incidental finding， serious CNS sequel-ae may ensue. In retrospect， our patient developed symptoms such as diplopia， headaches， mood disturbances， and seizures that were suggestive of PR， yet clinicians did not recognize thepotential seriousness of these symptoms. Specifically， clini-cians did not consider the possibility of VI nerve palsy， which can present as a falsely localizing sign in the setting of in-creased ICP， particularly in patients with CNS TB who develop diplopia. Failure to recognize this could have resulted in per-manent cranial nerve damage or death. We suggest that he should have been evaluated for increased ICP， including de tailed neurological examination， and considered for interven-tions such as serial LPs or VP shunting earlier in his clinical course. It is possible that his prolonged symptoms of head-aches and pseudoseizures may have been attributed to un-der-recognized increased ICP.\n\n【21】Our patient illustrates the challenge of managing paradoxi-cal reactions because physicians must rule out other causes of clinical or radiological worsening， including drug resistance and poor medication adherence. In countries such as the U.S. where TB prevalence is low and technological interventions are readily available， it is tempting to image and biopsy new radiographic lesions， as was done with our patient， due to un-familiarity with the presentations of PR. However， these inter-ventions may cause more harm and delay other possible ef-fective interventions.\n\n【22】The American Thoracic Society and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for treatingdrug-susceptible extrapulmonary TB recommend 2 months of 4-drug ATT followed by INH and RIF for a total of 9-12months . Steroids are recommended for 2-4 weeks， with a 6-8-week taper in patients who develop paradoxical reac-tions . Treatment for paradoxical reactions is not well-es tablished， but there seems to be some agreement as to the use of corticosteroids in paradoxical reactions involving the CNS. Our patient's treatment included 8 months of 4-drug ATT and10 months of prednisone， which was not in line with guide lines， and reflected the clinicians’ uncertainty and discomfort in treating paradoxical reactions.\n\n【23】While his behavioral issues may have been a part of the CNS-involved paradoxical reaction or other underlying psy-chiatric illness， prolonged steroid use may have also played a role， causing steroid-induced psychosis and/or depression. Interestingly， the paradoxical reactions developed in our pa-tient while he was receiving steroids， raising questions about their role， efficacy， and recommended doses and duration in such reactions， which has yet to be established in the litera-ture. Interestingly， prior reports show that treatment with ATT for such reactions has varied， with a range of treatment span-ning 315-722 days .\n\n【24】He was also diagnosed with Pott’s disease involving T8 and T9， and on follow-up MRI 7 months into ATT， manifested new， non-contiguous vertebral lesions at T5 and T7， suggestive of a paradoxical reaction. In contrast to the worsening of existing vertebral lesions described by Im et al. ， our patient devel-oped new enhancement and compression fractures at non-con-tiguous vertebrae. Non-contiguous spinal involvement is rare， although a prospective study in South Africa found that 16%of 98 patients with TB spondylitis had such lesions on spine MRI at diagnosis . Nonetheless， our patient’s case suggests that non-contiguous spinal TB can be seen not only at time of diagnosis， but also as part of a paradoxical reaction， even after 7 months of ATT. There have been few reported cases of paradoxical reaction involving TB spondylitis. Im et al.  reported 4 cases of paradoxical reactions in HIV-seronegativepatients that developed 2-12 weeks after starting 4-drug ATT； symptoms included worsening lower back pain and leg weak-ness， and T1-gadolinium-enhanced MRI showed worsening of vertebral enhancement . All 4 patients underwent surgi-cal decompression， finished 9-12 months of ATT， and recov-ered without sequelae .\n\n【25】Conclusions\n\n【26】In summary， we report a patient with extrapulmonary TB man-ifesting as concurrent Pott’s disease and TB meningitis， who subsequently developed paradoxical reactions in the brain and potentially in the spine during appropriate ATT and steroid ther-apy. This paradoxical reaction manifested with clinical symp-toms - focal neurologic symptoms- and changes on radio-logical imaging. While multiple studies have found that some paradoxical reactions in extrapulmonary TB do not adversely affect overall clinical outcome ， CNS lesions can have seri-ous consequences and thus require more vigilance and poten-tially enhanced intervention， including surgical management. Conversely， better understanding of this clinical presentation can lead to avoidance of unnecessary invasive interventions such as multiple biopsies or unnecessarily prolonged antimi-crobial and steroid treatment. However， there is at present no consensus on how to best manage these patients. In countries with low TB prevalence， we believe that increased awareness of extrapulmonary paradoxical reactions in HlV-negative pa-tients should inform clinical decision-making， including guid-ing appropriate use of clinical diagnostics and interventions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

E. coli is the most common causative organism， followed by Klebsiella and Enterobacter. It commonly occurs in old age patients with comorbidities， such as DM， bladder out-let obstruction， and immunosuppression. The symptoms include abdominal pain， dysuria， urgen-cy， urinary frequency， hematuria， fever and rarely pneumaturia. It is usually diagnosed on CT ab-domen and treated with IV antibiotics.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】This is a case of 69 years old Hispanic male with past medical history of uncontrolled diabetes mel-litus， colorectal carcinoma s/p hemicolectomy and colostomy， recently diagnosed with brain and lung metastasis. The patient was admitted secondary to hematuria of one day duration without any fever， abdominal pain， dysuria， urgency or urinary frequency. Vital signs were stable and system-ic examination was unremarkable. CT of the abdomen/pelvis showed gas pockets in bladder wall. He was treated with IV piperacillin/tazobactam.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】The patient with emphysematous cystitis presents similar to one with simple UTI. A high index of suspicion is needed to diagnose this infection in an old patient with multiple comorbidities， as this is a very lethal condition if not recognized and treated early with ⅣV antibiotics.\n\n【6】key words： emphysematous cystitis · rare lower urinary tractinfection· hematuria\n\n【7】BACKGROUND\n\n【8】Emphysematous cystitis is a rare infection that occurs in an old age patients， especially females， with uncontrolled DM.Immunosuppression，steroids， recurrent urinary tract infections and urinary obstruction are the other risk fac-tors. Among the all factors， DM with poor glycemic con-trol is the most common risk factor. Uncontrolled DM suppresses the immune system and urinary glucose is the substrate for proliferation ofinfective organisms. Here we present a case of an elderly male with uncontrolled di-abetes mellitus， metastatic carcinoma， and ongoing ste-roid use who presented to our emergency department with gross painless hematuria， later on diagnosed with this rare UTI， and responded to prompt administration of IV antibiotics.\n\n【9】CASE REPORT\n\n【10】The patient is a 69 year-old male with PMH of type 2 DM， and colon cancer with brain and lung metastases s/p hemi-colectomy with colostomy placement who was brought to our institution because ofone-day history of gross hematu-ria. The patient denied any abdominal pain， dysuria， uri-nary frequency/urgency， or any trauma.\n\n【11】Medications at home include dexamethasone，insulin， dutas-teride and acetaminophen.\n\n【12】On physical examination， BP was 123/73， pulse 111/min，res-pirations 18/min， temperature 97.6F. Cardiovascular exam showed regular rhythm， without any murmurs， rubs or gal-lops. Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen was soft， nontender， with normoactive bowel sounds and co-lostomy bag in place.\n\n【13】Initial labs showed white blood cell count in the upper limits of normal， with predominance of polymorphonucle-ars. Coagulopathy work-up was unremarkable.Urinalysis showed RBCs too numerous to count， WBC 6-10/HPF， loaded bacteria， and epithelial cells 0-2/HPF. CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed a distended urinary bladder with air-fluid level， air within the bladder wall， and prob-able gas within the distal left ureter， and right ureter or pelvic venous structures . The patient was giv-en one dose of vancomycin and was started on piperacil-lin-tazobactam after blood and urine cultures were tak-en. Urine culture grew >100，000 CFU/mL of Eschecrichia coli sensitive to cephalosphorins but resistant to quino-lones. Blood culture showed no growth within 5 days. Hemoglobin Alc was 11.3%. The patient noted resolu-tion of hematuria by the 3hospital day. Repeat CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis no longer showed gas in the urinary bladder wall or the collecting system of the left kidney. Urine culture repeated on the 4h hospital day showed no growth. The patient was sent home improved and stable on oral cefpodoxime.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n\n【15】Emphysematous cystitis is a rare lower urinary tract in-fection characterized by gas pockets in the bladder wall and lumen， caused by bacterial and fungal organisms. The causative organism produces carbon dioxide byfermentation. Escherichia coli is the most common caus-ative organism. Klebsiella preumoniae， Enterobacter aerogenes，\n\n【16】Enterococcus sp.， Proteus mirabilis， Staphylococcus aureus，\n\n【17】Clostridium perfringens， Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida\n\n【18】albicans are among the organisms that can produce this clinical entity as well.\n\n【19】Diabetes mellitus is the most common risk factor for em-physematous cystitis， with 60-70% of patients affected have diabetes. Other risk factors include prolonged blad-der outlet obstruction， female sex， older age， recurrent uri-nary tract infections， neurogenic bladder， urinary tract in-strumentation， vesicoenteral/vesicovaginal fistulas， and immunosuppression.\n\n【20】Patients can present with abdominal pain (in 80% of cases)， dysuria， hematuria， urinary frequency/urgency， and rarely， pneumaturia. Patients may also be asymptomatic.\n\n【21】Urinalysis findings do not differ from simple urinary tract infections. CT of the abdomen and pelvis is the preferred imaging study as compared to plain films as it is more sen-sitive and can differentiate air within the urinary bladder from adjacent bowel gas. A high index of suspicion is need-ed for the diagnosis of emphysematous cystitis as symptoms are the same as a simple urinary tract infection.\n\n【22】Patients with emphysematous cystitis are initially treated em-pirically with broad spectrum IV antibiotics until culture re-sults are available. Piperacillin-tazobactam， quinolones，and carbapenems are the most common antibiotics used.There are currently no guidelines available for empiric treatment options due to limited data availability.\n\n【23】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【24】Our patient with emphysematous cystitis has multiple risk factors for this condition： uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and immunosuppression secondary to both metastatic malignancy and steroid use. A high index of suspicion is needed to diagnose this rare entity since it presents sim-ilarly to a simple UTI. Prompt recognition is important as it can be a lethal condition if not treated early with IV antibiotics.\n\n【25】1\\.

His vital signs were notable for a mild fever and tachycardia.Otherwise， the rest of his exam was unremarkable. The laboratory test was significant for leuco-cytosis and diffuse reticular-nodular and interstitial infiltrates on chest radiograph. Urine drug toxicology was negative.

On the other hand， pulmonary sequelae have been reported rarely， as evidenced by a case series of 4 patients with organizing pneumonia， a case report of severe lung injury after chronic SC inhalation， and a case report of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage after SC use .\n\n【9】We present a case of a young man with fever who developed transient pulmonary infiltrates after inhalation of K2， a syn-thetic cannabinoid.\n\n【10】Case Report\n\n【11】A 29-year-old man， previously healthy， was brought in to the emergency department (ED) for severe agitation after smoking K2， a synthetic cannabinoid. He was asymptomatic of myalgia， upper respiratory tract symptoms， pleuritic chest pain， and dys-pnea. He admitted to smoking K2 and was found by the ED team to be in possession of K2. He had a past history of schizoaffec-tive disorder and was not on any treatment. He denied prior his-tory of illicit drug use. He had no prior hospital admission to our center for substance abuse. There was no other medical history.\n\n【12】He required multiple doses of lorazepam and haloperidol to be sedated.On examination，he was found to be drowsy but arous-able. His vital signs were a mild fever of 100.2°F (37.9℃)， blood pressure 110/50 mmHg， tachycardia of 109/min， respiratory rate of 18/min， and oxygen saturation of 95%. The chest ex-amination showed good air entry on both lung fields， no crack-les， no wheeze， and no rhonchi on auscultation. A cardiovas-cular exam noted that JVP was not elevated. S1 and S2 were heard， no additional heart sounds， no murmurs， no rubs， rate and rhythm were regular. Otherwise， the rest of examination was unremarkable. The laboratory test  was significant for leukocytosis (18.5) with predominant neutrophilia (83.4%). Urine drug toxicology  was negative for cannabinoids， phencyclidine， cocaine， benzodiazepine， methadone， opiates，and barbiturates. The chest radiograph  on admis-sion noted diffuse reticular-nodular and interstitial infiltrates. Two blood culture samples were taken on admission， returned later as no growth after 5 days of incubation.\n\n【13】The patient was hydrated with Ringer's lactate solution and given stat doses of Ceftriaxone 1 g intravenously， Azithromycin500 mg intravenously， magnesium sulfate 2 g intravenous for hypomagnesemia， potassium phosphate 22 mEq intravenous for hypophosphatemia， Famotidine 40 mg oral daily for gas-trointestinal prophylaxis， and heparin 5000 units subcutane-ously twice daily for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.\n\n【14】At 24 hours after admission， his mentation improved and tem-perature returned to within normal limits. A repeat chest ra-diograph 24 hours after admission  noted resolu-tion of the pulmonary infiltrates. However， he refused repeat blood investigations to assess for improvement of abnormal blood values from admission.\n\n【15】The patient was concluded to have a diagnosis of inhalation fever caused by synthetic cannabinoid. He was discharged in stable condition from the hospital with advice to abstain from synthetic cannabinoids and he was given a course of oral le-vofloxacin 750 mg daily for 7 days for empirical treatment of pneumonia and Risperidone 1 mg oral twice daily for 2 weeks for schizoaffective disorder. Although an outpatient clinic ap-pointment was scheduled for the patient， he was lost to fol-low-up and the long-term outcome is unknown.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】There are more than 50 specific types of SC reported in the United States . SC markedly differs from natural mari-juana in terms of metabolism， receptor affinity， and clinical ef fects . Frequently encountered SC molecular structures include JWH-018， AM-2201，AB-001，AM-1220， and JWH-015 .\n\n【18】Both synthetic cannabinoids and delta-9 tetrahydrocannab-inol act on the endocannabinoid receptors， the cannabinoid(CB) receptor-1 that is found in the central nervous system and CB-2 receptors in the immune system . A study by Bronova et al. showed CB-1 receptor-mediated signalling of pul-monary fibrogenesis in radiation-exposed mice . Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV-4) that can be activated by endogenous N-acylamine cannabinoids and fatty acid-de-rived products related to anandamide during lung injury (chlo-rine gas or intratracheal hydrochloric acid). TRPV-4 activation can increase lung capillary permeability and trigger alveolar edema and has inflammatory effects. TRPV-4 inhibitors were shown to have anti-inflammatory effect .\n\n【19】Table 1.

Inhalation fever is defined by as a non-allergic， noninfectious， flu-like syndrome， commonly occurring after acute inhalation of organic dusts， metal and plastic fumes . However， this patient did not experience symptoms of malaise， nausea， myalgia， headache， cough， or dyspnea， which are symp-toms associated with inhalation fever . Leucocytosis is a feature seen in inhalation fever . Inhalation fever is as-sociated with a transient， self -limiting course and it is treated with supportive care and avoidance of the causative factor .\n\n【22】Acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis can present in a similar manner， as they occur rapidly within several hours of expo-sure to an antigen that triggers an immune response . It can be associated with mild or absent symptoms and can re-solve after hours or days . Chest radiographic findings havebeen reported to be normal or numerous poorly defined small(less than 5-mm) opacities throughout both lungs， occasional-ly with sparing of the apices and bases . Acute hypersen-sitivity pneumonitis can be non-progressive and intermittent， with spontaneous improvement after antigen avoidance .\n\n【23】Inhalation of particles can deposit along the respiratory tract from the upper airways to the tracheobronchial tree and al-veolus depending on the particulate size and solubility in wa-ter. Acute chemical pneumonitis may thus present as an inflammatory reaction to the particulate in the form of bron-chitis，bronchiolitis， pulmonary edema， diffuse alveolar hemor-rhage， and acute respiratory distress syndrome . Chemical pneumonitis can be an effect of the inhaled drug itself or con-taminants present in the inhaled substance . Resolution of the symptoms can occur with withdrawal of the offending substance .\n\n【24】Lastly， we had considered a diagnosis of bacterial pneumo-nia in this patient， as he had presented with low-grade fever， tachycardia， leukocytosis， and chest radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltrates on admission. He was given a course of oral levofloxacin as empiric treatment. However， infection is less likely， as evidenced by the repeat chest radiograph at 24hours after admission demonstrating resolution of the infil-trates and negative growth on 2 blood culture samples after5 days of incubation. Bacterial pneumonia has been shown to have radiographic clearing after 5 weeks in some patients and in most cases within 2-3 months .\n\n【25】Conclusions\n\n【26】SC inhalation can present as inhalation fever. This case report adds to the growing body of literature on pulmonary sequel-ae of SC. As the Emergency Department visits by SC abusersare increasing， the importance of physicians being aware of these adverse effects cannot be overstated. Inhalation fever is self-limiting. Treatment is focused on supportive care and causative factor avoidance. Further scientific research is need-ed to assess the role of endocannabinoid receptors and syn-thetic cannabinoids in inhalation fever.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The most frequently observed hemorrhagic events are microscopic he-maturia， hemoptysis and in more severe cases intracranial hemorrhage . On the other hand， hemarthrosis involv-ing the knees is reported but hemarthrosis of the shoulder is a rare occurrence and has not been reported in previous studies involving a great number of patients using throm-bolytic medication. This report describes the occurrence of shoulder hemarthrosis associated with the use of SK in the acute phase of myocardial infarction.\n\n【9】CASE REPORT\n\n【10】A fifty-year-old white female patient was admitted to the emergency room with the typical chest pain of acute cor-onary syndrome which had begun 30 minutes before. She had risk factors for coronary disease such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia. A physical examination was done with the finding of S4 on heart auscultation and clear lungs. The electrocardiogram showed ST elevation in V1→V5 leads. When she was admitted to the intensive care unit， she re-ceived acetylsalicylic acid (325 mg) and nitroglycerine drops and SK infusion 1，500，000 IU was started. After the end of the administration， performed over 60 minutes， electrocar-diographic alteration appeared suggestive of coronary re-perfusion， evolving without homodynamic alteration. Eight hours after the end of the thrombolytic infusion， she com-plained of severe pain in the right shoulder. A physical ex-amination demonstrated a slight increase in temperature and bulging of the shoulder without erythema and discol-oration. There was tenderness of the right shoulder joint in addition to severe limitation of range of motion.There was no history of trauma in the past. X-ray of the shoulder was normal， without any fracture of bone. We performed arthrocentesis of the right shoulder and obtained a frankly hemorrhagic synovial fluid (70 ml) that didn’t clot. Analysis confirmed hemarthrosis and excluded presence of crystals. After drainage the pain was decreased. MRI of the shoul-der demonstrated high signal fluid， normal tendons， mus-cles and labrum in T2w images .\n\n【11】On the third day of admission arthrocentesis was done again because of severe pain and we obtained 50 ml of hemor-rhagic fluid. A hematological evaluation excluded the pos-sibility of a coagulation disturbance. The patient recov-ered after 6 days with complete remission of local signs and symptoms.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n\n【13】This case report is the first one in the medical literature related to the occurrence of shoulder hemarthrosis after the use of SK. The occurrence of acute hemarthrosis re-sults in the appearance of intense local pain and inflam-matory signs.\n\n【14】Hemarthrosis is normally associated with a history of pervi-ous trauma orjoint instability. However， nontraumatic causes such as complications from oral anticoagulant use  and less frequently from heparin use have been described . The occurrence of hemarthrosis after the use of a throm-bolytic is rare. The first cases of secondary hemarthrosis due to the use of SK were reported by Oldroyd in 1990：Hemarthrosis of the knee accurred in 2 patients with acute coronary syndrome treated with SK， acetylsalicylic acid and heparin； the first patient had right knee meniscus removal35 years before and the other suffered from symmetric se-ronegative erosive polyarthritis .\n\n【15】Two cases were reported by Sanders； one of the patients with a history of articular disease was treated with recom-binant tissue -plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and heparin. The second patient with a history of knee surgery 4 years before was medicated with SK and acetylsalicylic acid .2001， Gallego reported two other patients with Hemarthrosis after the use of recombinant tissue - plasminogen activa-tor and heparin. The first patient had a right knee sprain four days before the hemorrhagic event and the second had right knee tendinitis .\n\n【16】Another case that was reported by Pimeta and Anti in 2003demonstrated bilateral knee involvement due to SK and Acetylsalicylic acid in a patient with gout joint disease \n\n【17】All cases only demonstrated knee involvement. The present report describes involvement of the shoulder joint direct-ly due to the use of intravenous SK and acetylsalicylic acid in the acute phase of myocardial infarction. In almost all previously mentioned reports the complications occurred due to the use of combined thrombolytic therapy with ace-tylsalicylic acid and heparin. All cases had a history of joint problems， which probably predisposed to bleeding with anticeagulant or thrombolytic agents， but this patient had no history of joint problems or trauma. This patient was treated as recommended for other causes of hemarthrosis. such as joint puncture for symptom relief， performance of synovial analysis and use of anti-inflammatory and analge-sic medication. The patient recovered without secondary ioint disease.\n\n【18】When acute arthritis occurs after acute MI other differential diagnoses should also be considered， which include acute gouty arthritis and joint disease due to calcium pyrophos-phate deposit (pseudo-gout). These two diseases may be\n\n【19】SHAZEANIRUBABE 59F Kashan MD-UN Iinaging Cente\n\n【20】triggered by MI. In this case these diseases were ruled out by the absence of crystals in the synovial fluid.\n\n【21】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【22】As thrombolytic therapy is still very important and often used to decrease MI damage， intensive care physicians should be aware of the possibility of a less common complication like hemarthrosis， which seems to occur more frequent-ly in previously compromised joints. Correct and early di-agnosis， associated with careful evaluation of the risks and benefits of the medication， enables simple and efficient in-tervention， relieving patient discomfort and reducing the risk of joint Sequela.\n\n【23】REFENRCES：", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

There was no history of abdominal trauma. For three weeks prior to admission to hos-pital， she complained of sore throat， malaise and fever. The clinical and laboratory examinations confirmed infectious mononucleosis and anemia. The ultrasonography showed enlarged ovary and large amount of free pelvic fluid. The patient underwent emergent surgery. At laparotomy， an ac-tively bleeding ruptured cyst of the ovary was found to be the cause of the hemoperitoneum. Twa hours later the patient’s condition suddenly worsened. Patient was clinically shocked with pallor， hypotension and tachycardia. The drain collected 700 mL of blood.

She made a good recovery and was discharged from hospital after a 12-day hospital stay.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】Patients with symptoms of hypovolemic sheck and abdominal pain following infectious monenu-cleosis should be suspected of having splenic rupture. Operative management still remains the pre-ferred treatment for spontaneous rupture of the spleen following infectious mononucleosis， espe-cially in hemodynamically unstable patients.\n\n【6】key words： splenic rupture· splenectomy· infectious mononucleosis\n\n【7】Fatalities secondary to infectious mononucleosis (IM) are extremely rare and most often are the result of splenic rupture. Abdominal pain is uncommon in IM， and splen-ic rupture should be deeply considered whenever abdom-inal pain accurs. Spontaneous rupture of the spleen de-velops in 0.1-0.5 percent of patients with proven IM . The incidence of rupture is highest in second and third week of the illness， but also may be the first symptom of IM. A history of trauma may be elicited in about half of the cases of splenic rupture . Although， the introduction of non operative treatment is now accepted as an alterna-tive to splenectomy， still laparotomy remains the method of choice in hemodynamically unstable patients . High mortality rate and rarity of splenic rupture in the course of IM is rare enough to warrant mention and further case is presented.\n\n【8】CASE REPORT\n\n【9】A previously healthy 27-year-old female presented with acute onset of abdominal pain， nausea and vomiting. There was no history of abdominal trauma. For three weeks prior to admission to hospital， she complained of sore throat， mal-aise and fever.\n\n【10】At the admission the patient was hemodynamically stable. The abdomen was soft with tenderness in the lower abdo-men. On initial examination cervical lymphadenopathy was found and the tonsils appeared inflamed. The find-ings were suggestive of infectious mononucleosis. Test for Epstein-Barr virus IgM was positive (55.39 u； ELISA Nova Tec). Early laboratory data revealed anemia with he-moglobin level 8.9 gm/dL， the white blood cell count -17.8 K/mcl， the platelet count-87 K/mcl.\n\n【11】The ultrasonography showed enlarged ovary on the left side and large amount of free pelvic fluid. Additionally， het-erogeneous splenomegaly was demonstrated with an intact splenic capsule. The patient underwent emergent surgery. At laparotomy， 2000 mL of blood was found in peritone-al cavity， an actively bleeding ruptured cyst of the left ova-ry was found to be the cause of the hemoperitoneum. The ovarian cyst was excised， full hemostasis was achieved and the peritoneal cavity was drained.\n\n【12】Two hours later the patient's condition suddenly wors-ened. Patient was clinically shocked with pallor， hypoten-sion and tachycardia. The drain collected 700 mL of blood. Laboratory data revealed anemia with hemoglobin level7.1 gm/dL， the white blood cell count - 12.2 K/mcl， the platelet count-39K/mcl.\n\n【13】Patient was subjected to another immediate laparotomy. The peritoneal cavity contained a large amount of clotted and fluid blood. The spleen was enlarged to approximately double normal size. The pulp of the spleen was complete-ly disintegrated and a long tear was found on its anterior margin extending between both poles. A splenectomy was performed. Simultaneously， the patient was given 3 units of packed red blood cells. Another 5 units were transfused promptly after the operation， together with 6 units of fresh frozen serum and 4 units of platelet concentrate. After lap-arotomy the patient was transferred to intensive care unit and remained there for five more days. She made a good recovery and was discharged from hospital after a 12-day hespital stay.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n\n【15】Infectious mononucleosis is a clinical syndrome developing in response to infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The incidence of IM is estimated at 45 per 100，000 patients. The highest occurrence rate is in patients aged 15-25 years. IM， transmitted mainly in saliva， may have a various clini-cal presentation， but the symptoms typically consist of fe-ver， lymphadenopathy and pharyngitis. Simultaneously， the infiltration by lymphocytes and mononuclear leuco-cytes weakens the trabecular and capsular structure of the spleen. Disintegration of the spleen may lead to spontane-ous splenic rupture (SSR)， which is a life-threatening con-dition. The incidence of SSR is estimated at 0.1-0.5% of all cases with confirmed IM .\n\n【16】Usually there is no history of preceding injury of the ab-domen， which may cause the delay in accurate diagno-sis . In the presented case， thorough exploration of peritoneal cavity performed at first laparotomy did not re-veal any other sites of active bleeding， although enlarged spleen has been exposed. Possibly， transferring the pa-tient from the operating table after the surgery could have been traumatizing for distended spleen， which resulted in its rupture. The symptoms of hemodynamic instability af-ter the first operation led to conclusion that there might be a recurrent hemorrhage from ovary or possibly splen-ic rupture. Therefore， another immediate laparotomy has been performed.\n\n【17】There is a wide variety of clinical findings associated with the splenic rupture in IM. Patients may present signs pointing toward this dramatic complication hours or days before the most severe intraabdominal bleeding occurs .Recurrent episodes of bleeding may be followed by temporary sealing of the capsular tear by thrombus. IM is rarely accompanied with abdominal pain， thus SSR should always be seriously considered whenever abdominal pain occurs . The onset of pain may be subtle or sudden and is localized in left upper quadrant. Tenderness to palpation， with or without rebound tenderness， is usually present . Loss of blood to peritoneal cavity leads to hypovolemia， which， if not treat-ed promptly， may lead to cardiac arrest . In the case re-corded above， the patient was strictly monitored in postop-erative setting， while SSR occurred. Therefore， the bleeding could be immediately disclosed and treated.\n\n【18】Regardless of the phase of IM， diagnosis of SSR may be dif-ficult. Although， computerized tomography and ultrasound are specific in presenting the underlying pathology ， de-teriorating condition of the patient limits the appliance of these diagnostic tools.\n\n【19】The first authentic description of SSR in infectious mono-nucleosis was presented by King in 1941 . Splenectomy remained the treatment of choice for splenic rupture in IM until the first report of postsplenectomy sepsis was pub-lished by Shumacker in 1952 . Consequently， a grow-ing trend toward splenic conservation has been initiated.\n\n【20】Because of the rarity of SSR， no clear consensus of man-agement has been achieved. In the setting of hemodynam-ic instability， splenectomy is the procedure of choice . Recommendations for treatment in stable patients include the forms of splenic conservation involving splenorrha-1g SP phy， partial splenectomy， and splenic artery embolization. However， according to Stephenson， this treatment must be approached with caution given the risk of ongo-ing bleed and the unknown potential of delayed rupture. These patients should be cared for by an appropriate-ly trained surgeon， with close follow-up and activity limita-tion after discharge up to 6 months.\n\n【21】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【22】Patients with symptoms of hypovolemic shock and abdom-inal pain following infectious mononucleosis should be suspected of having splenic rupture. Splenectomy still re-mains the procedure of choice for spon taneous rupture of the spleen following infectious mononucleosis in the set-ting of hemodynamic instability.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

She received basiliximab perioperatively and her maintenance immunosuppression included tacrolimus， mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone. Computed tomography (CT) showed a large mediastinal mass with a large pericardial effusion. An echocardiogram revealed collapse of the right ventricle consistent with tamponade. We performed emergent pericardiocentesis to treat the tamponade. A mediastinoscopic biopsy of the mediastinal mass was done to establish a diagnosis. The mediastinal biopsy confirmed the growth of Nocardia. After 2 weeks of imipenem and 6 weeks of linezolid， there was marked ra-diographic improvement in the size of the mediastinal mass.\n\n【4】Conclusions： We report a rare case of a large mediastinal mass associated with pericardial tamponade from nocardia infec-tion in a renal transplant recipient. An invasive approach may be necessary to obtain tissue diagnosis to direct treatment in these cases. Prompt and appropriate medical therapy leads to marked radiographic improvement.\n\n【5】Key words： nocardia · mediastinal mass · pericardial tamponade · kidney transplantationNocardia infection is an increasingly recognized complication among solid organ transplant recipients. The clinical spectrum of Nocardia is broad. The usual clinical presentation includes pulmonary infiltrates with or without cavitation and subcuta-neous abscesses. The central nervous system may also be in-volved and brain abscesses are not uncommon. Mediastinal and pericardial involvement are rare. We present a rare case of no-cardia infection presenting as a large mediastinal mass associ-ated with pericardial tamponade in a renal transplant recipient.\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】A 30 year old African American female underwent deceased donor kidney transplant for end stage renal disease due to sys-temic lupus erythematosus. She received an interleukin-2re-ceptor blocker， basiliximab， for induction and was on tacroli-mus， mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone for maintenance immunosuppression. She is allergic to sulfa based medications and received three doses of monthly pentamidine inhalation for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis. She completed three months of valganciclovir for Cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophy-laxis. She had excellent graft function with nadir serum cre-atinine 1.1 mg/dl two months post transplant.\n\n【8】Her initial symptoms started four months before her current presentation when she was admitted to another institution for fever， cough and shortness of breath. Her chest radiograph(CXR) showed a left upper lobe infiltrate and she was treated with 14 days of moxifloxacin for community acquired pneu-monia. One week after she completed moxifloxacin， she re-ceived two weeks of amoxicillin/clavulanate due to persistent symptoms. Sputum and blood cultures were negative for bac-terial growth. Three months prior to her current presentation， despite her second course of antibiotic， she had intermittent fever and cough. She was readmitted in the same local hos-pital where CXR showed persistent left upper lobe infiltrate. The computed tomography (CT) of her chest confirms the in-filtrate and also showed small pericardial effusion. She had bronchoscopy and bronchial washing did not reveal bacterial etiology of the pneumonia. She completed three weeks of le-vofloxacin and had resolution of her symptoms.\n\n【9】Nine months after transplant she presented to our hospital with three weeks of intermittent fever and cough associated with progressive worsening of shortness of breath and hoarse voice. On physical examination， she was febrile and tachycard-ic. The auscultation revealed distant heart sounds and rales on bilateral lung fields. She had leukocytosis of 55，480/mm3with left shift and 93% neutrophils. She had acute kidney in-jury with increase in serum creatinine to 4.3 mg/dl. The chestradiograph showed bilateral pleural effusion， a widened me-diastinum and an enlarged cardiac silhouette. She initially re-ceived vancomycin， piperacillin-tazobactam and azithromycin for possible bacterial and atypical pneumonia. The CT scan of the chest  revealed a large mediastinal mass and a large pericardial effusion. There was diastolic collapse of the right ventricle on echocardiogram consistent with tamponade. Emergent pericardiocentesis was performed and640 ml of serosanguinous fluid was drained. The pericardial flu-id exhibited no growth of bacteria or acid fast bacilli. The fluid cytology did not reveal malignant cells. Soon after pericardio-centesis， the patient's serum creatinine was noted to gradual-ly decrease back to her baseline of 1.1 mg/dl. The impression was that the patient had renal hypoperfusion from the mas-sive pericardial effusion， causing acute kidney injury， which re-versed after a significant amount pericardial fluid was drained.\n\n【10】The mediastinal mass measured 7x5x9 cm in size with me-diastinal lymphadenopathy. The differential diagnosis for the mediastinal mass included thymoma，lymphoma， germ cell tu-mors and infectious etiology including fungal， bacterial and my-cobacterial infections. We held mycophenolate mofetil as the differential diagnosis also included post transplant lymphop-roliferative disorder (PTLD) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). She remained febrile after two days of admission and antibiotics were broadened to cover for anaerobes and extended spec-trum beta lactamase microbes. Antibiotics were changed from piperacillin-tazobactam to imipenem. The absence of pulmo-nary infiltrates made atypical infection less likely and azithro-mycin was discontinued. Fine needle aspirate of the medias-tinal mass were obtained via endobronchial ultrasound， but the results were inconclusive. A cervical mediastinoscopy was then performed and biopsies of mediastinal mass were done to obtain a definitive diagnosis. Three wrinkled orange colo-nies grew in Sabouraud dextrose agar and stained partially on modified acid fast. The microscopic examination showed branching beaded rods suspicious for Nocardia which was con-firmed by ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing. Mycobacterium fortuitum was also isolated by DNA sequenc-ing in sputum cultures. The CT scan of the brain did not reveal any lesions which may be present in other cases of dissemi-nated nocardia infection. Antitubercular medications were not initiated due to the absence of pulmonary infiltrates despite isolation of atypical mycobacterium in sputum. She continued antibiotic therapy with imipenem and linezolid for two weeks until Nocardia susceptibilities showed resistance to imipenem which was then discontinued. The patient remained on linezol-id monotherapy， and after six weeks of treatment， the repeat CT scan showed marked decrease in the size of mediastinal mass to 4.7x3.4x5 cm  with resolution of pericardi-al effusion. Her creatinine improved to baseline of 1.1 mg/d! and she remained on tacrolimus and prednisone for mainte-nance immunosuppression.\n\n【11】Nocardia is an aerobic actinomycete and is a member of the Nocardiaceae family . With the development of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) enzyme analysis and ribosomal ribonu-cleic acid (rRNA) sequencing， there are now over 50 species of Nocardia identified. It is a ubiquitous gram positive bacterium with filamentous branching hyphae on direct microscopy . Itmay infect immunocompromised individuals including trans-plant recipients， those with HlV infection， malignancy and on long term steroid use . The frequency of infection is higher among those who received heart (3.5%) and lung (2.5%) trans-plants compared to those with kidney transplants (0.2%) .\n\n【12】A Pubmed search revealed that this is the only case of Nocardia infection presenting with both a large mediastinal mass andpericardial tamponade. Among solid organ transplant recip-ients， this is the first reported case of Nocardia presenting as a mediastinal mass. There are several unusual aspects in this case aside from the unusual clinical presentation. The risk factors that have been previously identified for the de-velopment of Nocardia among transplant recipients are not present in our patient. She had three episodes of pneumo-nia， treated with three different antibiotics with resolution of pulmonary infiltrates before presenting with mediastinal mass and pericardial tamponade. Definitive diagnosis for eti-ology of pneumonia was not elucidated despite bronchosco-py on her prior episodes of pneumonia. She then presented with a large mediastinal mass. She required an invasive ap-proach using mediastinoscopy guided biopsy of mediastinal mass as endoscopic ultrasound guided biopsy was still in-conclusive. Isolation of Mycobacterium fortuitum in sputum raises the concern for coinfection， which impacts choice of treatment. The hoarseness is thought to be from recurrent la-ryngeal nerve involvement which has improved after marked decrease in the size of the mediastinal mass. Despite mild compression of trachea on CT scan， surgical intervention was not necessary with clinical and radiographic improvement af-ter prompt antibiotic therapy.\n\n【13】The clinical spectrum of Nocardia infection is broad and may range from localized involvement to disseminated infection. Clinical manifestations in solid organ transplant recipientstypically include pulmonary infiltrate and abscesses involving subcutaneous tissue and brain . Intrarenal abscess， epi-dydimo-orchitis and atypical zygomycosis has been reported.Mediastinal and pericardial involvement are rare. A case of nocardiosis presenting as anterior mediastinal mass in a patient with thymoma and myasthenia gravis was recently reported . The patient had a mediastinal cystic mass， un-derwent thoracotomy for biopsy and was subsequently diag-nosed with malignant thymoma. Abscesses in the mediasti-num later developed and isolated Nocardia. Another case of purulent pericarditis from Nocardia has also been reported in a renal transplant recipient . In this case however， the pa-tient had a prior episode of pericardial effusion that required pericardiocentesis. In these cases， one may postulate that Nocardia was an infectious complication of prior surgical pro-cedures with percutaneous seeding， considering the ubiqui-tous nature of the organism.\n\n【14】The radiographic features of pulmonary nocardiosis have been studied in a large series of 44 patients . Majority of the patients presented with airspace disease and pulmonary nod-ules. Lung parenchymal masses were noted in 11 of 44 patients without lobar predominance but none had a mediastinal mass.\n\n【15】Risk factors for Nocardia infection among solid organ trans-plant recipients have been investigated. Greater risk of infec-tion is noted among those with extremes of age， high dose steroids， granulocytopenia and uremia . A history of CMV infection and high levels of calcineurin inhibitors were also identified as independent risk factors . These characteris-tics were not present in our patient. The risk factors observed are maintenance immunosuppression and possibly not receiv-ing trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) postoperative-ly for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis.\n\n【16】There are two potential pathogens isolated in this case， rais-ing a possibility of coinfection. Coinfection of Mycobacterium fortuitum with Nocardia is rare and has been reported in li-poid pneumonia after aspiration . The absence of pulmo-nary infiltrates in CT scan argued against the pathogenicity of atypical mycobacterium in the sputum. Therefore， in contrast to the previously reported case of coinfection， antituberculous therapy was not initiated.\n\n【17】Our patient had disseminated Nocardia infection based on the mediastinal mass and pericardial effusion despite nega-tive blood cultures. The previous episodes of pneumonia may be due to undiagnosed pulmonary nocardiosis that partial-ly responded to treatment with fluoroquinolones and amox-icillin/clavulanate. As pulmonary is the most common portal of entry for Nocardia， we postulate that the multiple partial-ly treated episodes of pneumonia later progressed to medi-astinal nocardiosis.\n\n【18】Guideline for treatment of Nocardia has not been established. A high index of suspicion and prompt appropriate medical therapy is of utmost importance. Our patient initially had broad spectrum coverage with piperacillin-tazobactam， van-comycin and azithromycin for bacterial and atypical pneu-monia but continued to have intermittent fevers. The antibi-otics were then switched to imipenem and oral linezolid to cover for anaerobes， gram negative and gram positive bacte-ria， including Nocardia. She received two weeks of dual ther-apy until the susceptibility data showed that the Nocardia strain was resistant to imipenem. She continued treatment with linezolid monotherapy， with resolution of symptoms and marked radiographic improvement of mediastinal mass by 6weeks of therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Conservative treatment was ineffective， and emergency surgery was chosen. A novel surgical procedure-open internal stenting of the main pancreatic duct via pancreatowirsungotomy and duodenotomy- was used successfully in this difficult case. The elimination of pancreatic ductal hyperten-sion and maintenance of maximum physiological pancreatic juice outflow， achieved via surgery， led to rapid improvement in the patient’s condition. He was discharged on the 26 day after surgery. The clinical outcome was good at the 2-year follow-up.\n\n【2】Conclusions：\n\n【3】Open stenting of the main pancreatic duct can be recommended for treating patients similar to the patient described in this paper - having severe complications of CP against the background of a relapse， exhaustion， and being in a severely or critically ill general condition. This surgical procedure is especially important when minimally invasive methods of eliminating pancreatic hypertension are technically unsuccessful or impossible due to the lack of necessary equipment and staff.\n\n【4】MeSH Keywords： Pancreatic Ducts ·Pancreatitis， Chronic ·Stents\n\n【5】Abbreviations： PDH - pancreatic ductal hypertension； CP -chronic pancreatitis； OISPD- open internal stenting of the pancreatic ductPancreatic ductal hypertension (PDH) is one of the key pathoge-netic factors of chronic pancreatitis (CP) . The main causes of PDH are fibrosis and calcification of the pancreas and sur-rounding fatty tissue， calculi， and strictures of the main pan-creatic duct. Inadequate outflow of the pancreatic juice leads to severe pain and creates conditions for CP relapse with char-acteristic clinical and laboratory manifestations.\n\n【6】In contrast to acute necrotizing pancreatitis， in exacerbation of CP developing against the background of PDH， there is no phase of acute toxemia. It is characterized primarily by se-vere pain， hyperamylasemia， pancreatogenic masses and fluid collections， infiltrative duodenitis， pleural effusions and peri-tonitis， external and internal pancreatic fistulas， portal vein thrombosis，pylephlebitis， and sepsis . In some cases， the disease can be most clearly and concisely defined as \"chronic frequently relapsing pancreatitis\". Effective treatment of this form of the disease is a challenge for surgeons and internists. None of the methods of conservative and surgical treatment have the necessary combination of qualities that combine suf-ficient efficacy， safety， and minimal negative impact on the pa-tient's quality of life.\n\n【7】One of the authors of this article (NMZ) theoretically justified and introduced into practice a new operation in CP-open in-ternal stenting of the pancreatic duct (OISPD). The purpose of this intervention is to restore the passage of pancreatic juice from the patent part of the pancreatic duct into the duodenal lumen by creating an artificial channel in the head of the pan-creas through an area of obliteration of the ductal system，the functioning of which is supported by a rigid stent. This proce-dure is very effective for treatment of CP relapse developing against the background of PDH， including cases of frequently relapsing pancreatitis. From June 2010 to December 2016，38 interventions were performed. In 18 (47.4%) cases， a re-lapse of CP combined with PDH was present.\n\n【8】Here， we present one of our cases vividly illustrating the effi-cacy and safety of OISPD in complicated relapsing CP in a crit-ically ill patient.\n\n【9】Case Report\n\n【10】A 63-year-old male patient was treated in our surgical de-partment from 13 Feb 2014 to 2 Apr 2014 with acute onset of chronic alcoholic pancreatitis. He was a long-term drinker and tobacco smoker. The disease was complicated by pancre-atic duct calculi， ductal hypertension， a parapancreatic inflam-matory mass， fermentative ascites-peritonitis，2-sided pleural effusions， sepsis， and cachexia.\n\n【11】The patient was admitted with complaints of upper abdomi-nal pain， fatigue， an increase in volume of the abdomen， loss of appetite， and weight loss. He considered himself to have been ill since Dec 2013. He was treated in the surgical depart-ment， and then on an outpatient basis， due to the worsening of CP， and after improvement he was discharged in Jan 2014. We planned to perform OISPD 2-3 months after the inflam-matory process had resolved. However， the patient’s condition rapidly worsened due to the development of the next acute onset of CP. After 2 weeks of unsuccessful home treatment. he was hospitalized again on 13 February 2014. On abdomi-nal ultrasonography， signs of acute pancreatitis， parapancre-atitis， and omentobursitis were revealed. A large amount of free fluid was detected in all parts of the abdominal cavity. The blood biochemistry analysis revealed an increased amy-lase level (1500 IU/l). Conservative treatment was carried out(e.g.， intravenous rehydration， parenteral nutrition， antibiot-ics， and octreotide). More than 4 liters of ascitic fluid were re-moved during laparocentesis， and the content of amylase in this fluid could not be measured since it was prohibitively high.\n\n【12】Despite ongoing treatment， the patient's condition progressively worsened. Abdominal pain persisted， exhaustion increased， and the temperature curve acquired a hectic character. The level of blood amylase increased to 2330 U/L The patient's appe-tite completely disappeared， and his mental status changed. There were signs of twilight consciousness and apathy. The skin became gray and cyanotic. His weight dropped to 49 kg， with a height of 170 cm. Given the presence of ascites and pleural effusions， the patient’s true weight was about 44-45 kg.A body mass index of 15.2 was accompanied by extreme exhaustion.\n\n【13】Echography on 25 Feb 2014 showed the size of the pancreas to be 33x17x23 mm； the contours of its head were blurred and indistinct， and there was also a mass consisting of the head of the pancreas， the duodenal wall， and omentum. An area of low echogenicity measuring 27x17x16 mm was detected in the mass. The Wirsung duct was dilated to 8 mm. About 3 liters of free fluid were present in the abdominal cavity. Follow-up echography on 28 Feb 2014 showed the same findings， but dilatation of the Wirs ung duct had increased to 10 mm， and the volume of free fluid had increased to about 5-6 liters. Computed tomography showed typical findings of CP relapse， with small calcifications， PDH， and ascites .\n\n【14】The persistence of PDH precluded treating the patient for the CP exacerbation， and the catabolic processes reached an al-most irreversible level. We decided to perform OISPD almost as a“last chance surgery\".\n\n【15】Surgery was performed on 7 Mar 2014 via a midline laparot-omy. Four liters of clear yellowish fluid were evacuated from the abdominal cavity. In the pelvic cavity， the fluid was turbid， and there were fibrin overlaps. The stomach was slightly en-larged， and its wall was infiltrated and hyperemic. The duo-denal wall was also inflamed and thickened. An inflammatory mass was palpated behind the stomach， extending down to the mesocolon and mesentery root of the small intestine and up to the hepatoduodenal ligament. The omentums and mes-enteries had a few plaques of steatonecrosis. The gallbladder was not distended. The gastrocolic ligament was mobilized. The anterior surface of the pancreas was divided from the thick adhesions. Due to significant inflammation， it was almost im-possible to differentiate the lower and upper margins of the pancreatic head and body.\n\n【16】Puncture of the Wirsung duct was performed under ultra-sound guidance， followed by pancreatotomy with Wirsung duct opening. The pancreatic juice flowed freely. The bougiepassed freely in the distal direction. During bougienage in the proximal direction， an obstruction was found about 10 mm from the duodenal wall.\n\n【17】Using force， the bougie was pushed through into the lumen of the duodenum， with subsequent duodenotomy. A plastic stent with a diameter of 9 Fr and a length of 9 cm (Cook， Ireland) was introduced into the main pancreatic duct. The duodenot-omy and pancreatotomy incisions were sutured. The abdom-inal cavity and the omental bursa were washed with saline solution and drained. A diagram of the key stages of surgery is shown in Figure 2A-2D.\n\n【18】In the postoperative period， intravenous rehydration，antibac-terial therapy， and parenteral nutrition were continued. Blood amylase level dropped to normal on the 5th day， and body tem-perature also normalized. The wound healed. In blood cultures. growth of Streptococcus faecalis was detected， but it later dis-appeared. About 900 ml of serous fluid was evacuated from the right pleural cavity by thoracentesis. The general condi-tion of the patient gradually improved， including his appetite and mood. He was discharged on the 26 day after surgery.\n\n【19】A follow-up examination was performed in the hospital 2months after surgery. The patient had no pain and was eating normally. His weight had reached 63 kg (weight gain of 14kg). Blood and urine tests were within normal limits. Ultrasound findings were： chronic calculous pancreatitis， pancreas size32×15×17 mm， and inflammatory mass completely resolved. The Wirsung duct was not dilated. There were small residual ascites， and the total volume of free fluid in the abdominal cavity was about 300 ml. There were no pleural effusions. On duodenoscopy， a patent pancreatic stent was visible.\n\n【20】Ten months after the operation， endoscopic replacement of the stent was performed. Upon examination of the extracted stent， it was found to have small adhesions on the walls but its lumen was patent. By this time， the patient had no com-plaints， and his condition was satisfactory. He had gained20 kg in weight . Two years after the operation， the patient was invited for another examination. During this time， no episodes of exacerbation of CP were observed. There was no need for further replacement of the stent in this patient， so the stent was removed endoscopically. Unfortunately， the patient was then lost to follow-up. Finally， he died of acute liver failure caused by excessive alcohol consumption， 3 years and 1 month after surgery. This diagnosis was confirmed at the autopsy. There were no signs of disturbed outflow of bile and pancreatic juice， with good patency of pancreatic duct.\n\n【21】Discussion\n\n【22】Treatment of CP accompanied by PDH， especially in cases of persisting or continuously relapsing pancreatitis， is a serious problem in modern clinical medicine.\n\n【23】Conservative treatment， which is based on the use of analge-sics， neuromodulating agents， proton pump inhibitors， octreo-tide， and replacement therapy with pancreatic enzymes ， can only give temporary relief (and even then， not always)， since it does not eliminate PDH as a key factor in the patho-genesis of CP.\n\n【24】Surgical treatment of CP in its relapsing stage， developing against a background of PDH， has been an unresolved problem until now. Most surgeons would not run the risk of radically operating on patients with CP relapse，preferring conservativetherapy， with the expectation of subsiding inflammatory events. Unfortunately， the continuously relapsing form of CP is charac-terized by resistance to conservative treatment， and in some cases it is not possible to overcome the inflammatory process.\n\n【25】The standard drainage and resection-drainage procedures that are currently widely used in the treatment of CP (longitudi-nal pancreaticojejunostomy， Beger and Frey procedures ) are not applicable in exacerbation of pancreatitis. The se-vere inflammatory process， the presence of fluid collections， septic complications， and the poor nutritive status of the pa-tients make the formation of pancreaticodigestive anastomo-ses very dangerous (or even impossible) due to the high prob-ability of their leakage .\n\n【26】Endoscopic stenting of the pancreatic duct can help in elimi-nating PDH and resolving the inflammatory process， but it is not sufficiently effective due to the technical impossibility of passing the guidewire (and then the stent) into the duct ， which is firmly compressed by the dense pancreas tissue in many such patients.\n\n【27】Another management option for PDH is the very rarely used method of open external drainage of the pancreatic duct， as advocated by Professors Nina N. Artemyeva and Nikolay Y. Kokhanenko (Saint Petersburg， Russia)， and this method is al-most unknown outside Russia. In this procedure，decompres-sion of the pancreatic duct is achieved by small pancreatow-irsungotomy with the introduction of 2 thin external drains in the proximal and distal direction (to the pancreatic head and tail). During surgery， stones are removed from the duct and strictures are dilated. Then， the incision in the pancreas is su-tured， the drain is inserted into the omental bursa， and the in-tegrity of the gastrocolic ligament is restored. An almost man-datory part of the intervention is jejunostomy or gastrostomy to reinfuse pancreatic juice .\n\n【28】Our (YNS) observation of patients who underwent this pro-cedure in the clinic headed by Prof. Kokhanenko allow us to consider it safe and effective. There were no technical compli-cations or mortality， and PDH was relieved in all cases. A very unexpected phenomenon was the significant increase in out-flow rate of the pancreatic juice 2-5 weeks after surgery. It would seem that a pancreas with severe pathologic changes can produce only a small amount of juice. However， in some patients the daily volume of juice reaches 700-800 and even1000 ml. Reinfusion of such a large volume of juice via a jeju-nostomy is much more convenient and comfortable for a pa-tient than perora. administration. These data perfectly dem-onstrate the importance of the therapeutic role of eliminating PDH in CP surgery. Pancreatic drains should be left in place for a long time， usually several months. In some (30-50%) pa-tients， with the subsidence of the CP relapse， the patency ofthe Wirsung duct in the pancreatic head is restored， and nat-ural passage of the pancreatic juice recovers. In such cases， drains should be removed. With compliance with the indicated diet， cessation of alcohol intake，and adequate maintenance therapy， CP patients can have long-term remission. In the re-maining patients in whom PDH persists， radical surgery (usu-ally pancreaticojejunostomy) is indicated after their condition improves， the exacerbation of CP is relieved， and their nutri-tional status is restored 8.\n\n【29】Thus， neither extensive nor less-invasive surgeries， nor con-servative treatment in an isolated variant， can be considered as a universal method for the management of persisting CP.\n\n【30】The OISPD approach developed by us combines the positive features of both minimally invasive and “big\" surgeries cur-rently used for the treatment of CP. At the same time， it is free of many disadvantages that are common in the alterna-tive surgical interventions.\n\n【31】After pancreatowirsungotomy， stones can be removed from the pancreatic duct and/or strictures can be dilated， thereby improving pancreatic juice outflow. Due to severe fibrosis of the pancreatic head， forced instrumental tunnel formation in the gland tissue and medial duodenal wall is much safer than it might seem at first glance. We did not observe any signifi-cant bleeding or damage to adjacent anatomical structures. The pancreatic juice flows through the stent into the duodenum but not into the jejunum (as after pancreaticojejunostomy)， which is physiologically better. Unlike procedures involving external drainage of the pancreatic duct (both less-invasive and open)， our OISPD approach allows direct outflow of the pancreatic juice into the duodenum and does not require its reinfusion. During this single procedure (unlike endoscopic stenting)， we can correct the other presenting complications of CP (e.g.，ob-structive jaundice， duodenal stenosis， and large pseudocysts) by simultaneous interventions. All these arguments empha-size the special value of the described procedure as a univer-sa. method of treating patients similar to those described in this paper (ie， those with severe complications of CP against a background of its exacerbation， exhaustion， and a severely or critically ill general condition).\n\n【32】Our first OISPD procedures were performed under such cir-cumstances， when endoscopic (ERCP-based) and endoscopic ultrasound-guided interventions were impossible due to tech-nical and organizational reasons. Subsequently， after being im-pressed by the good immediate results， we began to use this procedure as the method of choice in complicated CP， and also in the described case.\n\n【33】The most serious drawback of OISPD is its invasiveness， as it requires a laparotomic approach. However， OISPD is muchless time-consuming than pancreaticojejunostomy and espe-cially Frey and Beger procedures. The second disadvantage of this surgery is the need for regular endoscopic replacement of stents. Nevertheless， the need for periodic visits to the doctor and repeated endoscopic interventions disciplines pa-tients and encourages them to follow the necessary diet and proper lifestyle.\n\n【34】In the future， the technical details of the procedure can be im-proved. When creating a tunnel in the pancreatic tissue， ele-ments of coagulation can be used to reduce the mechanical force at this stage of the operation. Such a technique will， in some cases， make it possible to completely avoid duodenotomyin favor of endoscopic assistance while placing the stent into the formed tunnel.\n\n【35】Conclusions\n\n【36】The novel OISPD procedure can be effectively and safely used in chronic frequently relapsing pancreatitis with PDH， even in seriously or critically ill patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

We hypothesize that con-tinuous and compliant use of CPAP machines may be benefi-cial in reducing recovery and severity of SARS-CoV-2.\n\n【8】Case Reports\n\n【9】Patient #1\n\n【10】A 41-year-old woman with a past medical history of gener-alized anxiety disorder， post-traumatic stress disorder， hypo-thyroidism， and high body mass index (BMI) presented to an outpatient sleep diagnostic lab for evaluation of OSA. She was referred to the lab by her primary care physician， who did not note any recent mood or medication changes. Her concerns included loud snoring， difficulty with supine sleep， nocturnal gasping/choking episodes， daytime naps (non-refreshing)， poor concentration， increased irritability， morning headache，sleep fragmentation， spousal disturbance， restless sleep， sleep talk-ing， bruxism， and nocturia. Her Epworth Sleepiness score was15/24. After evaluation， she was scheduled for a sleep study. Review of the sleep study demonstrated an initial apnea-hy-popnea index (AHI) of 9.4 with lowest oxygen saturation of88%.Treatment with a CPAP machine was ordered. Subsequent follow-up visits showed the patient remained compliant with the machine and remote downloads of the CPAP device dem-onstrated an average AHI of 1.1 to 2.1/h with CSA 0.1 to 0.6/h.\n\n【11】During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic， she presented 2 months lat-er with a chief concern of chest congestion， worsening morn-ing headaches， nasal congestion， fatigue， and subjective fevers. She tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reac-tion (PCR) test. We continued to monitor the patient’s remote CPAP downloads (ResMed AirSense 10)， which demonstratedsignificant changes in AHl and development of transient CSA. The downloads did not show any changes in Cheyne-Stokes respirations. Raw waveforms during the central sleep apnea episodes were unfortunately not reported in the download. Of note， prior to diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2 and after resolution of symptoms， the patient's AHI and CSA episodes returned to baseline. See Table 1.\n\n【12】Patient #2\n\n【13】A 34-year-old man with a past medical history of obstructive sleep apnea， excessive daytime sleepiness， moderate-severe insomnia，high body mass index， gastroesophageal reflux dis-ease， and non-compliance with CPAP therapy presented to an outpatient sleep diagnostic lab with a chief concern of fatigue. He was initially referred to the lab by his primary care physician2 years prior. He did not note any recent mood or medications changes. He presented during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic for a routine follow-up. He had concerns of a productive cough， subjective fevers， and shortness of breath. His primary care physician ordered a SARS-CoV-2 by PCR and was confirmed positive. As with patient number 1， we continued to monitor the patient's remote CPAP downloads (ResMed AirSense 10)， which demonstrated significant changes in AHl and develop-ment of transient CSA. The downloads did not show any chang-es in Cheyne-Stokes respirations. Raw waveforms during the central sleep apnea episodes were not reported in the down-load. Eventually， the patient's AHl and CSA episodes eventual-ly returned to baseline. Prior to the diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2and after delayed resolution of symptoms， the patient's AHI and CSA episodes eventually returned to baseline .\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】A literature review revealed no case reports， manuscripts， or trials explaining the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and central sleep apnea. Our 2 case reports suggest that there is a link between SARS-COV-2 infection and some insult to the central nervous system causing central sleep apnea episodes. Some authors theorize that， in patients with SARS-CoV-2 and obstructive sleep apnea， a pro-inflammatory state is created that diminishes systemic blood vessel endothelium，including the brain. The mechanism of action for this injury is thought to be from oxidative stress， metabolic changes， and a pro-in-flammatory phenotype that likely led to endothelial dysfunc-tion and injury .\n\n【16】The presentation of the 2 case reports had similarities and dif-ferences both in past medical history and course of disease. Both patients had similar concerns， tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR， and had underlying mood disorders without any recent changes in medications. In patient number 1， the moodsymptoms worsened during the disease， including poorer con-centration and increased irritability. There were no medication changes to her anxiolytic/antidepressant during the infection. Her mood symptoms gradually improved after the disease state resolved. In patient number 2， there was no exacerba-tion of mood symptoms. We hypothesize there could be a cor-relation between mood， metabolism， or medication changes causing central sleep apnea episodes. Our case presentations suggest the link is more consistent with SARS-CoV-2 causing an increase in central apnea index (CAI).\n\n【17】Table 1.

Other important causes of CSA include hypoxia or severe hypoventilation . AHl lev-els reaching 30-50 suggest a periodic breathing pattern. The high number of CSA events and almost all events were cen-tral. We suggest that this is a true finding of CSA and is less likely to be a suppression of controller gain (change in venti-lation induced by a change in PaCO2 level)， chemoreceptor re-sponsiveness， chemoreceptor sensitivity， plant gain (ability of lungs and respiratory muscles to increase ventilation)， or mix-ing gain， which could be affected by infections through hypoxia， hypoventilation， fluid in the lung， change in lung compliance， or increase in arousals. Neither of our patients had cardiac， pulmonary， or neurologic diseases besides OSA or other find-ings to suggest these mechanisms of action.\n\n【20】Treatment emergent-sleep apnea (TECSA， formerly complex sleep apnea) describes the appearance of central sleep apnea and/or hypopnea while undergoing treatment for obstructive sleep ap-nea . Common risk factors of TECSA include cardiac conditions such as coronary artery disease， hypertension， congestive heart failure， atrial fibrillation， and stroke . Ventilatory controller in-stability as described in the previous paragraph， when severe OSA patients showed a high “loop gain”， was not present in our2 patients. We recognized TESCA and determined that this sleep-breathing disorder was not associated with risk factors， epide-miological prevalence， or clinical characteristics of our patients. Central sleep apnea was not observed on previous CPAP down-load data and the patients had predominant OSA at baseline.\n\n【21】Central apneas are defined by the device and algorithms. The al-gorithms respond to flow changes and could have increased the pressure in response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection inducing more centrals . We are not aware of any wakefulness or coughing that could have caused an artifact that could have been recorded as an open airway apnea . We recognize that positional AHI is a potential factor， but are unable to report on this as it was not recorded during patient interviews. Transient increases in CSA can occur in people traveling to high altitude locations .We did not record if they had any recent travel， this was unlikely to be the cause of the transient CSA. We elected to not include download reports weeks prior and after the SARS-CoV-2 infec-tion because they were similar at baseline AHI and CAl.\n\n【22】We postulate that in patient number 2， CSA episodes devel-oped early in the disease state but were unable to be detect-ed due to non-compliance with the machine. The question remains why did patient number 1 improve and patient num-ber 2 symptomatically took longer to recover and had a worse CAl. We know SARS-CoV-2 is not fully understood. It has dif-ferences in presentation and severity. We reviewed and com-pared both patients. The major difference between the 2 pa-tients was non-compliance. We hypothesize that continuous and compliant use of CPAP may be beneficial in reducing re-covery and severity of SARS-CoV-2， especially in patients who develop CSA episodes during a SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【23】We do know that obstructive sleep apnea and SARS-CoV-2share a similar at-risk clinical presentation of developing ex-trapulmonary manifestations， including neurological complica-tions . It remains to be seen if SARS-CoV-2 can directly result in the permanent development of CSA. These 2 cases show-case a transient development of central sleep apnea with a re-turn to baseline. In both cases the average AHl of the patientremained slightly elevated after resolution， signifying the pa-tient's respiratory drive has sustained an unknown assault to either the neurological or respiratory system.\n\n【24】Conclusions\n\n【25】Our case report calls attention to the acquired central respi-ratory drive neurological complication associated with SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesize that continuous and compliant use of CPAP may be beneficial in reducing recovery time and severity of SARS-CoV-2. Our case report highlights the plausible existence of a relationship between development of central respiratory drive leading to CSA and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are needed to explore this relationship， including evaluating if CSA occurs in SARS-CoV-2 patients with no history of OSA.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It accounts for only 1-2% of uterine malignancies. We report the case of a 75-year-old postmenopausal woman who presented a large abdominal mass compatible with uterine leiomyoma. She underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy obtaining a surgical piece weighing 9820g. The diagnosis of Uterine leiomyosarcoma is made by histopathological examination after surgery. This clinical case demonstrates that it is essential to consider a possible malignancy diagnosis to reduce the prevalence of occult Uterine leiomyosarcoma.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Leiomyosarcoma， Diagnosis， Uterus， Hysterectomy\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Uterine sarcomas account for 3-8% of all uterine malignancies， with leiomyosarcoma (LMS) being the most frequent histologi-cal subtype . Uterine LMS is a rare and extremely aggressive malignant mesenchymal tumour of the smooth muscle lining. It represents 1% of all malignant diseases of the female genital tract， accounting for approximately 60% of all uterine sarcomas. It usually presents as a voluminous tumour in women over 40years of age. It is associated with nonspecific symptoms，most often vaginal bleeding (56%)， palpable pelvic mass (54%)， or pelvic pain (22%) . However， most women are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. In rarer cases， the LMS can prolapse through the cervix . Uterine LMS have complex genetic aber-rations without any specific molecular or genetic marker and are often diagnosed in the advanced stages of the disease . Magnetic resonance imaging is the ideal imaging technique to characterize uterine masses. However， although certain features are suspicious of LMS， the differential diagnosis with leiomy-oma is difficult. In the same way， tumour biopsy is associated with a non-negligible rate of false negative results . In general，address： Centro Hospitalar Universitario do Algarve； Address： Rua Leao Penedo，8000-386 Faro， Algarve， Portugal； Contact email： arrmateus@gmail.com； Phonenumber： +351919502449in many patients， the diagnosis is made postoperatively when a benign leiomyoma is expected. LMS presents as a malignant tumour with poor prognosis even when confined to the uterus at the time of diagnosis. The 5-year survival rate varies between18.8 and 68%. Even for stages I - Ⅱ， the 5-vear survival rate varies between 40 and 85%， with a relapse rate of 38-50%.\n\n【4】Case report\n\n【5】A 75-year-old Caucasian woman with spontaneous menopause at age 50 was admitted to the orthopaedics service following a transtrochanteric fracture of the right femur. She was referred to the Gynecology service due to the presence of a large palpa-ble abdominal mass identified during this period. In addition， the patient reported increased abdominal volume for about 6months. Physical examination revealed the presence of an ab-dominopelvic mass， lateralized to the right， non-movable， which extended to the xiphoid appendix. Abdominal ultrasound re-vealed the existence of a large mass， which occupied the entire hemi-abdomen on the right， exerting compression on the liver and right kidney. It was a mass with a solid echostructure， well-defined borders， doppler colour score 2-3 with minimal cystic areas that could correspond to hemorrhagic or hyaline degeneration in the context of a possible giant leiomyoma. No free fluid was identified in Douglas' pouch. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed a tumour mass mea-suring approximately 30x15 cm， markedly hypervascular， with some areas of central necrosis and calcifications， which extended from the median region of the lower abdomen to the lower liver border， conditioning moulding， and compressing the vesicu-lar and pyelocaliceal excretion systems bilaterally (compatiblewith very large uterine leiomyoma). No other alterations were found， namely adenomegaly.  Analytically， tumour markers CA 125， CA19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were within normal limits， and serum lactate dehydrogenase(LDH) increased slightly. However， although the main suspicion was based on a uterine leiomyoma， the possibility of malig nancy was not excluded， considering the rapid mass increase in postmenopausal women. A total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed， obtaining a surgical piece of total hysterectomy and bilateral adnexectomy weighing 9820g.  The anatomopathological report of the uterus describes the presence of a nodule， on the right lateral portion， with 26 cm of the longest axis， heterogeneous， with hem-orrhagic areas and areas of necrosis， compatible with probable LMS. The immunohistochemical exam confirmed the diagnosis. The patient underwent a new CT scan for tumour staging that did not reveal the existence of metastases and was referred for an oncology gynaecology consultation. \n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Uterine leiomyoma is the most common pelvic neoplasm in women， affecting 70% of white women and 80% of black women throughout life. Uterine sarcomas are significantly rarer and have a poor prognosis .\n\n【8】Leiomyomas， responsive to estrogen and progesterone， show greater growth in women of childbearing age. The first symp-toms can develop as early as the third decade of life in black women and in the fourth decade of life in white women. Nor-mally， after menopause， leiomyoma stabilizes or shrinks in size. In contrast， increased age is considered a risk factor for the de-velopment of uterine sarcomas， which are more frequent after menopause .\n\n【9】Leiomyomas do not appear to progress to sarcomas. How-ever， these two entities often coexist . Currently， available imaging methods for evaluation， diagnosis and differentiation between benign and malignant leiomyoma are not very specific， making diagnosing LMS an enormous challenge. Magnetic reso-nance imaging (MRI) might offer some information but is not entirely accurate. On ultrasound， both sarcoma and leiomyoma present as focal uterine tumours， and both may have central necrosis . Also， the imaging diagnosis proved to be quite chal-lenging in this clinical case. Both ultrasound and CT showed the existence of a giant leiomyoma as the most likely diagnosis， which in some cases can lead to delayed diagnosis. Furthermore， it is known that in more than 70% of women， uterine leiomyoma has a similar symptomatic presentation to LMS， which can lead to a later intervention， as happened in the present case， where the only symptom reported by the patient was an increase of abdominal volume after 6 months of evolution.\n\n【10】Analytically， there may be an increase in serum LDH， often produced by LMS， which may help differentiate from leiomy-oma， as in the present case. However， the diagnosis is often unexpected， only confirmed by histopathological examination after a myomectomy or hysterectomy performed due to presum-able leiomyoma . The prevalence of LMS presumed to be leiomyomas at the time of surgery ranges from less than 1 to13 per 10，000 surgeries . Up to 33% of women with a recent diagnosis of uterine LMS have distant metastases， mainly in the liver and lungs .\n\n【11】In the clinical case presented， the imaging exams， carried out before and after the surgery， did not reveal the presence of distant metastases. This further supported the hypothesis that it was a giant leiomyoma， with the patient undergoing only abdominal surgery hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Uterine LMS， even when confined to the uterusat the diagnosis， is an aggressive tumour with a high risk of recurrence . Currently， LMS staging is based on the 2017International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics  classification， which does not predict the survival of these pa-tients. Thus， some studies suggest the prognostic usefulness of nomograms that incorporate variables such as patient age， tu-mor size， grade， local extension， distant metastases， and mitotic rate .\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】This clinical case demonstrates that it is essential to bear in mind a possible diagnosis of malignancy to reduce the prevalence of occult LMS. To this end， risk groups must be meticulously determined to prevent late diagnosis of this clinical entity as well as additional surgical procedures.\n\n【14】Abbreviations\n\n【15】·LMS-leiomyosarcoma\n\n【16】· CT -computed tomography\n\n【17】·CEA -carcinoembryonic antigen\n\n【18】· LDH -lactate dehydrogenase\n\n【19】·MRI -Magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【20】·FIGO - International Federation of Gynecology and Obstet-rics", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It is a neuro-biological activity that enables the reception and processing of sensory information， which arrive from the senses to the brain in large quantities at any time . Sensory disintegra-tion is an abnormality or disorder in brain function that makesit difficult to integrate sensory input stimuli . Difficulties in sensory integration occur when the brain and nervous system have difficulty receiving and processing sensory information or are not exposed to appropriate stimuli .\n\n【4】The tactile system represents the largest sensory system and develops first， still in intrauterine development. Tactile informa-tion is obtained through receptors ， located on the skin and in the throat， ear canals， digestive system . The most tactile receptors are located in the mouth and hands . The first role of touch in a child's life is to establish a connection between the mother and the infant， and this connection is also important for the further development of the child’s brain . The brain’s ability to successfully process tactile information allows a child to feel safe and to develop a connection with those around themHearing impairment in early childhood has consequences for the child's cognitive， emotional and social development. Hearing provides access to acoustic information needed for oral communication . Study has shown that most hearing-impaired children show significant delays in speech develop-ment and school achievement .\n\n【5】Hearing loss can lead to unusual integration of sensory information. For example， hearing impairment is associated with speech development difficulties， visual-spatial processing， visual-motor skills， and motor development. Difficulties also ex-ist with the vestibular system through poor posture and balance problems .\n\n【6】Children with hearing impairment may show difficulty in sensory processing. For example， anxiety may occur during personal hygiene. Children with hearing impairment may react hypersensitively or hyposensitivity to touch . Children with hearing impairment also show lower scores in terms of motor skills and balance as opposed to children of normal develop-ment . Children with hearing impairment have different types of behaviour such as hyperactivity， aggression， difficulty communicating and social interaction with other children， seek-ing attention from adults .\n\n【7】The study aimed to examine the prevalence of sensory in-tegration difficulties of the tactile sensory system of childrenwith hearing impairment and establish the statistical signifi-cance of differences compared to children without developmen-tal difficulties.\n\n【8】Study methods\n\n【9】Subjects\n\n【10】The study was conducted on a sample of 30 subjects.

The method of descriptive statistics was used. The ranks of matrices and the sum of the ranks of the representation of the differences in the difficulties of sensory integration of the tactile sensory system between children with hearing impairment and children without developmental difficulties were made.

difficul-ties\n\n【45】With an insight into the ranks of the representation matrices of differences in difficulties of sensory integration of tactile sensory system between children with hearing impairment and children without developmental difficulties， it can be concluded thatthere is a difference in the sensory integration of tactile sensorysystem between subjects and that children with hearing impair-ment show better results， that is better sensory integration ofthe tactile sensory system in relation to children without diffi-culties， on all variables of the measurement instrument excepton the variable 。Touching some parts of the body， hugs and ca-resses\"， where children without difficulties show better results.\n\n【46】Further analysis examined whether this difference in

testing for a link between sensory processing disorders and the duration of deafness or cochlear implant use. The sample consisted of 30 children with a hearing impairment aged 2 to 10 years. The study covered five types of stimuli： tactile， auditory， visual， vestibular and taste buds. When it comes to tactile sensory input， 76.70% of children have a normal sensory response， and 23.30% of children with hearing impairment have difficulties with sensory integration. Difficulties of sensory integration are manifested as hypersen-sitivity during hygienic activities， emotional reaction to touch， or the child reacts by pulling， touching people and objects to the extent of irritation. For example， children with hearing im-pairment react hypersensitively to playing with glue and paint and trying new foods， and they choose food depending on its texture.\n\n【51】Koester， Mailloux， Coleman， et al.  examined sensory integration functions in deaf children with an implanted cochlear implant. The study included 49 children aged 7 to 83 months.55 % of children had an adequate sensory response or a neutral reaction to tactile stimuli from baseline. In comparison， 45% of children showed some (30 %) or definite differences (15%) when it comes to sensory integration dysfunction. The authors state that children who have a loss of one sense， such as hearing here， may have a better developed tactile perception due to the loss of that sense.\n\n【52】·Children with hearing impairment have the same or bet-ter sensory integration or better sensory response of the tactile sensory system compared to children without de-velopmental difficulties.\n\n【53】·Children with hearing impairment show better results in neutral sensory response or normal sensory integration of the tactile sensory system. 80.00 % of children with hearing impairment and 26.67 % without developmental difficulties have normal sensory integration of the tactile sensory system.\n\n【54】· Children with hearing impairment show better results of sensory integration of the tactile sensory system on hy-posensitive sensory response.

Although the mechanisms of protection of the allogeneic fetus from the maternal immune response seem to have a main role through the preimplantation period， they are not yet described in detail. There appears to be an important relation between them and the polymorphism of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins. However， it is unknown which are expressed in the vaginal canal cells and how they behave during the menstrual cycle. This clinical research aimed to prove the existence of these unusual MHC proteins in vaginal cells， especially during ovulation. We selected women of reproductive age in different menstrual cycle phases and collected vaginal samples. The samples then were processed with immunofluorescence protocol or ELISA protocol techniques. The protein molecules that were calculated are MHCI， MHCII， TCRe B，TCRy 8. During ovulation， MHCII and TCRy 6 were expressed in higher numbers over MHCI and TCRe β (p=0.0461， p=0.0104)， using immunofluorescence. Whereas using ELISA showed statistical significance only in the expression of TCRy 6 over TCRe β (p=0.0012). Managing to identify the existence of polymorphic molecules of the immune system in the vagina proves the immunological reaction starts taking place in the vagina， and there is possibly a relation between the immunosuppression mechanisms surrounding trophoblast implantation and early pregnancy success. As the research progresses， it is possible to trace those mechanisms back to subfertility cases.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS subfertility， major histocompatibility complex， vaginal cells\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】The polymorphic molecules of the immune system， for example， the products of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)， can be observed in the vaginal environment of any woman of reproductive age， and probably they have an important role in the research in the field of subfertility and especially unex-plained subfertility. This study demonstrated the existence ofthose polymorphic molecules in the human female vagina-the first environment-the spermatozoa， initially meet during their journey to the ovum and start the conception process. The polymorphic molecules that can be either the Major Histocom-patibility Complex or T-cell receptors have been detected in the human female vagina at the end of this original clinical study.\n\n【4】Aims and Objectives\n\n【5】The goal of the present clinical research is to prove the exis-tence of these unusual MHC proteins in vaginal cells， especially during ovulation.\n\n【6】Materials and Methods\n\n【7】We selected women of reproductive age in different phases of the menstrual cycle. We followed routine protocol for obtain-ing vaginal sampling： using sterile gloves， insert colposcope， lavage with 5ml sodium chloride 0，9%， aspiration and repeat the procedure 2 times . The samples then were processed with immunofluorescence protocol or ELISA protocol techniques.\n\n【8】Results\n\n【9】The protein molecules that were calculated are MHCI， MHCI， TCRa B， TCRy 5. During ovulation， MHCII and TCRy ǒ were expressed in higher numbers over MHCI and TCRa B(p=0.0461， p=0.0104)， using immunofluorescence. Whereas using ELISA showed statistical significance only in the expression of TCRy S over TCRa B (p=0.0012).\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Polymorphism is the ability of a cellular-molecular entity to take different and various forms under different conditions； this condition may be very important in human reproduction.\n\n【12】To achieve pregnancy，local immunosuppression mechanisms are activated to protect the hemiallogenic embryo.\n\n【13】The vaginal cells being the first environment of passage for the semen， ignite local immunological reactions that may affect a couple’s fertility.\n\n【14】Managing to identify the existence of polymorphic molecules of the immune system and precisely the MCHI， MCHII， TCR&B and TCRy 5 in the vagina proves the immunological reaction that starts taking place in the vagina.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】The identified proteins are possibly related to the immunosup-pression mechanisms surrounding trophoblast implantation and early pregnancy success.

Col4a1 mutations are rare， most frequently affect neonates， and occur at a de novo mutation rate between27% and 40%. Mutations are commonly missense and pleiotropic， presenting with cerebrovascular， renal， oph-thalmological， and muscular abnormalities， collectively known as Gould Syndrome. Cerebral small vessel dis-ease is commonly associated with Gould Syndrome and Col4a1 mutations. Children can present with infantile hemiplegia/quadriplegia， stroke， epilepsy， motor dysfunction， or white matter changes of the eye\n\n【1】Case Report：\n\n【2】A male infant at 38-week， 4-day gestation presented with microcephaly， scattered multifocal hemorrhagic/ischemic infarcts， ex-vacuo dilatation， polymicrogyria， ventricular septal defect， and narrowed aortic arch，seen on prenatal ultrasound and confirmed by fetal echocardiogram and fetal brain magnetic resonance imaging(MRI). Electroencephalogram showed frequent subclinical seizures that were difficult to control， requiring mul-tiple agents. Ophthalmology evaluation demonstrated small， hypoplastic optic nerves of both eyes， concerning for septo-optic dysplasia. Postnatal brain MRI confirmed fetal findings. Postnatal genetic testing showed a de novo heterozygous variant of Cot4a1 and 1 nonspecific contiguous region of copy neutral absence of hetero-zygosity on chromosome 11.\n\n【3】Conclusions： This neonate was prenatally diagnosed with central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities and postnatally found to have a de novo heterozygous Col4a1 variant. CNS， cardiac， renal， and hematological findings were likely as-sociated with the Cot4a1 mutation and， possibly， a recessive genetic disorder of chromosome 11.Coi4a1 mu-tations are rare and have no definitive treatments. Subspecialist follow-up and supportive care are essential to reduce long-term complications.\n\n【4】Keywords： Brain Infarction · Porencephaly· Rare Diseases ·Chromosome Aberrations · Basement Membrane·\n\n【5】Indexed in： \\[PMC\\] \\[PubMed\\] \\[Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)\\]\\[Web of Science by ClarivateThe Col4a1 gene codes for 2 pro-alphal chains of type Ⅳ col-lagen that constitute a major component of the tissue base-ment membrane. Mutations in the Col4al gene are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern， commonly affecting neo-nates more than children or adults . The de novo rate of Col4a1 mutations is between 27% and 40% . Reported Col4a1 mutations are commonly missense variants of a glycine residue in the collagenous Gly-Xaa-Yaa helical domain of the COL4A1 protein. Mutations are pleiotropic and present with a broad spectrum of abnormalities in the cerebrovascu-lar， renal， ophthalmological， and muscular systems， collective-ly referred to as Gould Syndrome . Phenotypic presentation associated with Col4a1 mutations and Gould Syndrome is vari-able . One study cites tissue-specific mechanistic heteroge-neity as a possible cause of variability， with integrin signaling affecting ocular and muscular variability more specifically .\n\n【6】Diagnoses associated with the Col4a1 mutation most common-ly include hereditary porencephaly or parenchymal hemorrhage more broadly  and genetic cerebral small vessel disease ， which affects the small arteries， capillaries， arterioles， and ve-nules of the cerebrovascular system. In children， the Col4a1mutation is associated with infantile hemiplegia or quadriple-gia， stroke or epilepsy， motor dysfunction， and white matter changes of the eye on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) .\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】A male infant born at 38 weeks and 4 days gestation present-ed to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit with microcephaly，cen-tral nervous system (CNS) anomalies， and a hypoplastic aor-tic arch. The mother was a 24-year-old， gravida 2 para 1， who received prenatal care. Prenatal ultrasound showed multiple fetal anomalies， including microcephaly， scattered multifocal hemorrhagic/ischemic infarcts， ex-vacuo dilatation， polymi-crogyria， moderate ventricular septal defect (VSD)， and a nar-rowed aortic arch. The mother subsequently underwent a fe-tal MRI of the brain， which confirmed suspected ultrasound findings. Fetal echocardiogram showed a dilated right cardi-ac chamber and mild hypoplasia of the left cardiac chambers， along with a moderate muscular VSD and narrow aortic arch. She was then seen by the Cardiology， Palliative Medicine， and Neonatology Departments for prenatal care.\n\n【9】The infant was born via cephalic vaginal delivery， with me-conium-stained amniotic fluid. The birth weight was 2.45 kg. The APGAR scores at 1 and 5 min were 4 and 8， respective-ly. On physical examination， the infant had a dusky appear-ance of the bilateral feet and cool extremities. No other phys-ical abnormalities were seen. The baby was limp at birth withno spontaneous respiratory effort， required positive pressure ventilation at birth，and was then transitioned to continuous positive airway pressure. Postnatal echocardiography showed a fenestrated atrial septum and moderate mid-muscular VSD， mild to moderate hypoplastic left ventricle， moderately hypo-plastic left aortic arch， small to moderate patent ductus arte-riosus， and suprasystemic right ventricular systolic pressure. The infant was started on intravenous (i.v.) prostaglandin E1owing to suspected coarctation of the aorta. He was then giv-en i.v. epinephrine and dopamine drips because of hypoten-sion. Respiratory support was escalated from nasal continuous positive airway pressure to noninvasive positive pressure ven-tilation as a result of apnea， presumably secondary to prosta-glandin administration. An echocardiogram obtained after ini-tiation of prostaglandin E demonstrated a widely patent aortic arch with a VSD. A subsequent echocardiogram showed no ev-idence of coarctation， and prostaglandin E was discontinued.\n\n【10】Electroencephalogram showed frequent subclinical seizures. Seizures were difficult to control， requiring multiple agents， in-cluding i.v. levetiracetam 75 to 150 mg， i.v. lacosamide 6 mg every 12 h， and i.v. phenobarbital 13 to 50 mg. A subsequent electroencephalogram after treatment showed no additional seizures. An ophthalmology evaluation showed small， hypo-plastic optic nerves of both eyes， concerning for septo-optic dysplasia. The left eye showed a posterior polar cataract with microspherophakia. Postnatal MRI of the brain  confirmed findings of multifocal infarcts of unknown etiolo-gy， diffuse mild polymicrogyria， dysgenesis of the corpus cal-losum， optic nerve hypoplasia， a defect within the intraven-tricular septum， and inferior vermian hypoplasia.\n\n【11】Genetic analysis with rapid whole exome sequencing and chro-mosomal microarray were obtained owing to concern for pa-rental consanguinity. XomeDxXpress Clinical Exome Sequence Analysis showed a de novo heterozygous variant at c. 2771G>A of the Col4a1 gene. Chromosomal microarray analysis re-vealed a normal male sex chromosome with no other clinically significant abnormalities and a nonspecific contiguous region of copy neutral absence of heterozygosity on chromosome 11.\n\n【12】Postnatal renal ultrasound showed mild calyceal dilatation of the left kidney. Cytomegalovirus workup was negative.\n\n【13】The infant was weaned to room air and continued to improve on oral feeds. By the time of discharge， the infant was taking most of the feeds orally. The infant was discharged on room air and oral hydrochlorothiazide-spironolactone 3 mg， given the VSD with the pulmonary over-circulation.Oral phenobarbi-tal 20 mg/5 mL， oral levetiracetam 100 mg/mL， and oral lacos-amide 10 mg/mL were continued for seizure management with the Neurology Department.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Col4a1 mutations constitute a wide range of phenotypic pre-sentations that are categorized under Gould Syndrome，includ-ing cerebral small vessel disease， which has histopathologicfindings including reduced vessel lumens and wall thickening that cause reduced perfusion . Common manifestations of the Col4a1 variants include leukoaraisosis， strokes， and peri-natal intracerebral hemorrhage with consequent porenceph-aly， all of which constitute the“COL4A1 stroke syndrome” . Cerebral small vessel disease is commonly associated with isch-emic strokes in 20% to 30% of cases . Hereditary angiopa-thy with nephropathy， aneurysms， and muscle vessel involve-ment are associated with asymptomatic cerebral small vessel disease， large vessel cerebral involvement， and systemic in-volvement (eg， kidney， muscle， and eye) in the setting of Col4a 1mutations . Diagnosis is determined by the various clini-cal findings， along with genetic testing for the Col4a1 variant.\n\n【16】No specific treatment is available for the sequelae of Col4a 1 ge-netic variants. Stroke risk reduction， especially in the presence of hypertension，and neuroprotection are important to reduce the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage or other CNS complica-tions . Additional supportive care and follow-up with sub-specialists for systemic involvement are necessary to prevent progression. Counseling to avoid risk factors such as smok-ing，anticoagulants， and potentials for head trauma should be provided . Other individualized needs regarding home care and minimizing emotional， physical， and financial burden on caregivers are important to consider.\n\n【17】Genetic counseling is needed to identify the mechanism of in-heritance and potential downstream effects on family mem-bers and descendants. Prenatal testing is a consideration when the familial pathogenic variant is known .\n\n【18】Lastly， previous cases of Col4a1 variants are consistent with the neurological presentation in this case， including cerebral small vessel disease and optic nerve defects， broadly catego-rized under Gould Syndrome. Another study identified a sin-gle nucleotide polymorphism in the Col4al gene associated with arterial stiffness . The cardiac findings in our patient， namely aortic coarctation and VSD， have not previously been associated with Gould Syndrome or a Col4a1 variant and po-tentially convey the presence of multiple disorders. One pos-sible causative factor for an additional disorder in this patient is the nonspecific contiguous region of copy neutral absence of heterozygosity on chromosome 11. The presence of this re-gion in both parents may be indicative of a recessive disorder caused by a gene within the absence of heterozygosity region.\n\n【19】Conclusions\n\n【20】This case presents a neonatal patient who was prenatally di-agnosed with CNS and cardiac abnormalities and postnatally found to have a de novo heterozygous variant of the Col4a1gene and a nonspecific contiguous region on chromosome11\\. Postnatal CNS， cardiac， renal， and hematological findings constituted a likely association with the Col4a1 genetic mu-tation， alongside a possible recessive genetic disorder origi-nating on chromosome 11. Differential diagnoses included in-fectious causes， such as congenital cytomegalovirus. Col4a1mutations are rare and have no definitive treatments， owing to the variability in presentation. Follow-up subspecialist care based on specific organ systems affected and supportive carefor the patient and family， especially in the pediatric field， are essential to reduce long-term complications.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The patient scored 11/18 at the Frontal Assessment Battery(2/3 on mental conceptualization， 0/3 on programming and0/3 on inhibition). The 5-word test score was 6/10. The dig-it span was 4/5 forwards and 3/5 backwards. The language testing showed word-finding difficulty， paraphasias， and im-paired repetition.\n\n【14】The brain CT scan was normal. The brain MRI showed sym-metrical paramedian bi-thalamic abnormalities with low sig-nal on T1-weighted and high signal on T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences . For technical reasons， DWI sequence or magnetic resonance angiography could not be performed.\n\n【15】The electrocardiogram， transthoracic and transesophageal car-diac ultrasound， and Doppler echo of cervical arteries gave normal results. The biological work-up showed leucopenia(3600/mm3)， macrocytosis (104 fl)，and a positive serology to HI1. The serology of syphilis was negative； the CD4 count was not determined. The thick blood film test， Widal-Felix serodiag-nosis， and the toxoplasmic serology were negative. Blood glu-cose was 0.89 g/l， total cholesterol 1.08 g/l with LDL 0.65 g/l， HDL 0.30 g/l， and triglycerides 0.61 g/l.\n\n【16】Treatment after consultation was with an antiplatelet agent(Aspegic 100 mg/day).\n\n【17】The patient was lost to follow-up and reported dead 2 months later from an unknown cause.\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】We report a case of acute vascular dementia syndrome reveal-ing a paramedian bi-thalamic infarction associated with pos-itive Hl serology.\n\n【20】The paramedian territory of the thalamus is supplied by the posterior thalamo-subthalamic arteries， which originate from the segment P1 of the posterior cerebral artery. In some cas-es， the 2 arteries have a common origin and then form the Percheron artery， which supplies both thalami.\n\n【21】The prevalence of the Percheron artery varies； it ranges be-tween 4% and 12% in the general population according to Arauz et al. ， but Cosson et al. found it in as many as 8of 12 dissected brains.\n\n【22】The diagnosis of bi-thalamic infarction may be difficult at first because the clinical picture varies according to the extent of the affected territory. Arauz et al.  described 4 clinical forms according to whether the paramedian infarction extends to the upper mesencephalon or to the anterior thalamic territo-ry. When the infarction is limited to the paramedian territory， the clinical picture is dominated by cognitive and behavioral impairment. In the absence of motor impairment， a bi-thalam-ic infarction can masquerade as a toxic or metabolic encepha-lopathy， encephalitis， post-seizure state， or any other cause of delirium， and the key to the diagnosis is then brain imaging.\n\n【23】In our patient， the combination of aphasia， amnesia， and dys executive syndrome with significant social and functional im-pairment allows the diagnosis of dementia. Because of its acute onset in an individual with no previous medical history，this syndrome can certainly be ascribed to the thalamic infarc-tion， and is thus is a typical case of vascular dementia caused by a strategic infarction . The occlusion of a Percheron ar-tery can only be proved by angiography， CT， or magnetic res-onance， none of which were technically available at our insti-tution at the time of the diagnostic assessment of our patient.\n\n【24】The cerebro-vascular events in HIV-infected individuals have an estimated prevalence of 0.6% and occur on average around the age of 50 . Besides the usual causes of stroke， more spe-cific etiologies may be involved： vasculitis， coagulation disor-ders， opportunistic infections， or cardiac embolism . In our patient， the study of cerebrospinal fluid， CD4 assay， thrombo-philia， and cerebral angiography were not performed. As the patient's initial blood pressure was 140/100， small artery dis-ease associated with chronic suboptimal blood pressure con-trol cannot be ruled out. Thus， the responsibility of HIV can only be suspected in the present case.\n\n【25】Conclusions\n\n【26】A paramedian bi-thalamic infarction may initially present as a multidomain cognitive impairment of acute onset. MRI is the key to the diagnosis. A potential association with HlV infection is reported here for the first time. This case illustrates the need to perform an HIV serology in the presence of a bi-thalamic in-farction with no obvious cause， particularly in a young subject.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Ulterasound， computed tomography were compatible with those of renal cell carcinoma. With a diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma left radical nephrectomy was performed. This large， well-circumscribed， solid， tan to gray tumor showed histologic similarity to developing metanephric tubular epithelium. It is composed of uniformly small epithelial cells forming tubules. Immunohistochemically， tumor cells showed positive immunoreaction for vimentin but was negative for pancytokeratin， CK7， CD56， EMA and CD 10.Clinical follow-up revealed no evidence of recurrence after l year.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】Morphologically， metanephric adenoma shares features with papillary renal cell carcinoma(particularly the solid variant) and the epithelial component of the epithelial type Wilms’tumor. We reviewed previous article for using immunohistochemistery in differential diagnosis of metanephric adenoma. A panel includes CK7 and CD57 is better in differentiating papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) from MA. WTl may be useful in separating Wilms tumor from MA and PRCC but is not helpful in differentiating MA from PRCC.\n\n【6】Key words： kidney· metanephric adenoma · immunohistochemistery\n\n【7】Metanephric neoplasms are uncommon renal tumors that arise in both children and adults. They may be composed of small epithelial cells or benign stroma， or both， and are termed metanephric adenoma， meta-nephric stromal tumor， or metanephric adenofibroma， respectively .\n\n【8】Metanephric adenoma (MA) is a renal tumor that is generally detected in adults and occasionally in children. These tumors usually behave in a benign fashion . Clinically，pain， hematuria and palpable mass are the most common presenting signs. Females predominate by well over 2：1. A higher incidence of polycythemia is often found in these patients .\n\n【9】MAs are related to the proximal tubule of the fetal kidney or nephrogenic rests， and both the histo-logic and ultrastructural features of this tumor sug-gest similarities to metanephric tubular epithelium. Immunohistochemical evaluation showed that the tumor cells express proximal tubule marker URO-24\n\n【10】Microscopically MAs were usually unencapsulated but were sharply demarcated from the adjacent kid-ney parenchyma.\n\n【11】Histologically， tumors are composed of small epi-thelial cells that form small acini. The cells had scant cytoplasm with round to oval uniform nuclei with delicate chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli.No mitotic figures were present 2，7，8.\n\n【12】Morphologically， MA shares features with papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) type I， particularly the solid variant  and the epithelial component of the epithelial (tubular predominant) type Wilms’tu-mor without anaplasia . Most investigators now feel that these tumors are not genetically related.\n\n【13】Prior immunohistochemical studies of MA have shown no consistent staining patterns . Most tumors are reported to be negative for EMA with variable staining for cytokeratins. Positivity for CD57 (usually diffuse) and focal positivity for CK7 is often present . WT1 has also been reported to be positive .\n\n【14】The authors conclude that tumors with histologic， immunohistochemical， and genetic features charac-teristic of typical metanephric adenoma can present with metastatic disease .\n\n【15】CASE REPORT\n\n【16】A 56-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with complaints of right flank pain and fever.She had a abdominal palpable mass in physical exam and hematuria(2+) in urine analysis.\n\n【17】Ultrasonography showed a well circumscribed en-capsulated renal mass measuring 13x11 cm with mixed echo pattern in right kidney. There were several hyperecho round masses in liver that sug-gest metastasis. Abdominal sonography was normal3 years ago.\n\n【18】On radiographic examination， C.TSpiral of the abdo-men and pelvis presented a large enhancible heter-ogenous mass in right kidney suspected to renal cell carcinoma.  Also multiple hypodense foci in liver is noted suggestive for metastasis.\n\n【19】With a diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma left radical nephrectomy was performed. Surgical management of hepatic lesions was not performed because therewere multiple lesions in the liver. The operation was done during 2 hours and the level of difficulty was intermediate.\n\n【20】Macroscopically， the resected tumor， measuring 14x 10 x 8 cm， was well-circumscribed and solid and its cut surface displays a tan to gray color with a large foci of focal hemorrhage. There was on evidence of invasion to the capsule of kidney grossly.\n\n【21】Histological examination demonstrated orderly， close-ly packed， small round tubules lined by bland， darkly staining oval cells with little cytoplasm， merging with rounded nests of similar cells .\n\n【22】Immunohistochemically， tumor cells showed posi-tive immunoreaction for vimentin but was negative for pancytokeratin， cytokeratin-7(CK7)， cluster of differentiation-56(CD56)，epithelial membrane anti-gen (EMA) and cluster of differentiation-10(CD10).\n\n【23】All of immunohistochemical procedures were done by Envision method (using polymer for better detec-tion of antigen-antibody bonding in immunohisto-chemistery) and all of antibodies were from DAKO company of Denmark.\n\n【24】We believe this is a benign tumor， best classified as a metanephric adenoma because of its embryonic archi-tectural and cytological appearance， that can be recog-nized by its very characteristic pathological features.\n\n【25】Radiologic revision of our case emphasized that all liver masses are hemangioma according to pripheral enhancing.\n\n【26】Postoperative outcome was very good； the fever disap-peared after two days and the appetite was improved significantly. She discharged after one week.\n\n【27】One year after the surgery， CT scan of the patient showed no evidence of recurrence or metastasis.\n\n【28】DISCUSSION\n\n【29】Metanephric adenoma(MA) of the kidney is a rare， newly recognized entity of a unique benign renal tumor.\n\n【30】In the adult population， it is unlikely that meta-nephric adenoma can be prospectively differen-tiated from renal cell carcinoma based on imaging features .\n\n【31】The majority of the renal epithelial neoplasms can be diagnosed on the basis of histological examination alone. However， examples of morphologic overlap exist between selected malignant and benign entities， as seen between MA， some cases of solid variant of papillary renal cell carcinoma(PRCC) and well-dif-ferentiated Wilms'tumor.\n\n【32】Here we review previous article for using immunohis tochemistery in differential diagnosis of metanephric adenoma ：\n\n【33】In renal tumors， Wilms’tumor-1(WT1) expression is seen in Wilms’tumor， cystic partially differentiated nephroblastoma， rhabdoid tumor  and MA. CK7 is a type II (basic) keratin with a molecu-lar weight of 54 Kd . It is known to be positive in tumors from various sites including most cases of PRCC. CD57 is a glycoprotein that is expressed on a wide variety of normal and neoplastic tissues； however， its function and biochemical activity are not known . CD57 is expressed in the proximal tubules in the adult kidney .\n\n【34】The majority of the reported cases of MA have been negative for EMA， variably positive or negative forcytokeratins (AE1，AE1：AE3， high molecular weight cytokeratin)， and usually focally positive for CK7\n\n【35】Table 1. Review of lmmunohistochemical staining in previous study summarized here (each cell of this table correspond to one stady).\n\n| Immunohistochemical Markers  | Wilms\\` Tumor  |  |  | Child Wilms Tumor  | Metanephric Adenoma  | Papillary RCC  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Immunohistochemical Markers  | stromal  | blastema  | epithelium  | Child Wilms Tumor  | Metanephric Adenoma  | Papillary RCC  |\n| WT1  | Weakly Focally Positive in all  | Positive in all  | Positive in all  |  | Positive in all  |  |\n| WT1  |  | Positive in all  |  |  | Positive in all  | Positive in 12%  |\n| WT1  |  | Positive in all  |  |  | Positive in 70%  |  |\n| EMA  |  |  |  |  | Negative in all  |  |\n| EMA  |  |  |  |  | Positive in 16%  |  |\n| CK(AE1)  |  |  |  | Positive in all  | Positive or Neqative  |  |\n| CD 56  | Positive in all  |  |  | Positive in all  | Negative in all  |  |\n| CD57  | Negative in all  |  |  | Positive in all  | Positive in all  | Focally Positive in 4%  |\n| CD57  | Focally Positive in 12%  |  |  |  | Positive in all  | Focally Positive in 4%  |\n| Desmin  |  | Negative in all  |  |  | Negative in all  |  |\n| Desmin  |  | Negative in all  |  |  | Negative in 16%  |  |\n| CK7  | Negative in all  |  |  |  | Focally Positive usually  | Positive in most  |\n| CK7  | Focally Positive in 12%  |  |  |  | Focally Positive in all  |  |\n| Vimentin  |  |  |  |  | Negative in all  | Positive in 80%  |\n|  |  |  |  |  | Positive in 66%  |  |\n| Leu/  |  |  |  |  | Positive in 60%  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  | Positive in 33%  |  |\n\n【37】In one study all six cases of MA were strongly and diffusely positive with antibodies to WT1 and CD57and focally positive with antibodies to CK7. Stains for CD56 and desmin were negative. All seven cases of Wilms'tumor， including five child Wilms’ tumor and two adult Wilms’tumor， were strongly and diffusely positive with WT1 in the blastema and epithelium but showed only weak focal positivity in stromal cells. Six cases were diffusely positive for CD56 and one case showed focal positivity. The blastema of all cases of Wilms’tumor were negative for desmin， CK7， and CD57， although staining for keratin AE1， CD56， and CD57 was seen in maturing tubules of child Wilms’tumor cases 2.\n\n【38】in all MA. CD57 was positive in all six MAs that were stained， focally positive in one of 25 PRCC and one of eight Wilms’tumors. WT1 was positive in seven of 10 MA， three of 25 PRCCs and all eight Wilms’tumors. A panel includes CK7 and CD57 is better in differentiating PRCC from MA. WT1 may be useful in separating Wilms’tumor from metanephric adenoma and PRCC but is not helpful in differentiating MA from PRCC7J.\n\n【39】Features inconsistent with the diagnosis of MA， in-cluding multifocal lesions with a variable nuclear-cyto-plasmic ratio and diffuse cytokeratin-7 and epithelial membrane antigen immunopositivity .\n\n【40】In our case， immunoreactivity for vimentin and nega-tive reaction for CK7， CD56， EMA and pancytokera-tin is suggestive for metanephric adenoma according to previous study.\n\n【41】Another study of MA showed the tumor cells were immunoreactive for Leu 7 (three of five cases) and vimentin (four of six cases)， and a few tumors were immunoreactive for cytokeratin (two of six cases)， epithelial membrane antigen (one of six cases)， and muscle-specific antigen (one of six cases) .\n\n【42】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【43】In a recent study CK7 was positive in 20 of 25 PRCCs， focally positive in one Wilms’tumor and was negative\n\n【44】According to this finding， non of the immunohisto-chemical markers alone can use in diagnosis of MA and we need a panel of markers for excluding other differential diagnosis. A panel includes CK7， CD57， WT1 and CD56 is better in differentiating MA from PRCC and Wilms’tumor.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Flexible bronchoscopy revealed contraction of the bronchial demonstrating that tetany existed at the re-spiratory level， which rarely becomes evident. The clinical manifestations included trismus， facial paralysis， neck stiffness， and compromised respiratory function. The patient presented a state of respiratory failure that re-quired invasive mechanical ventilation which was evaluated by bronchoscopy and that showed spasms of the bronchial musculature. The patient presented generalized tetanus in which the bronchial affectation was eval-uated by bronchoscopy in the intensive care unit. In developed countries， the anti-tetanus toxoid vaccine has ostensibly decreased its incidence， while it is endemic in developing countries， and although there are mea-sures such as vaccination that try to reduce its incidence， in Ecuador there is an increase in incidences. In this patient case， contraction of the bronchial rings was observed， demonstrating that tetany existed at the respi-ratory level， which rarely becomes evident.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】Although muscular contractions are widespread， this clinical case evidences bronchial spams reported and vi-sualized by bronchoscopy.\n\n【5】MeSH Keywords： Bronchial Spasm ·Clostridium tetani· Tetanus Toxin\n\n【6】Abbreviations：\n\n【7】ICU - Intensive Care Unit； ARF- acute respiratory failure； ABB - acid-base balance； Vt-tidal volume； Vmin - minute volume； RR - respiratory rate； HR- heart rate； pH-the negative logarithm of the con-centration of hydrogen ions； pCo，- concentration of carbon dioxide； PO， -arterial oxygen partial pres-sure； SaO，-arterial oxygen saturation； FiO，- fraction of inspired oxygen； EB-excess base； ABG -arte-rial blood gases； HCO，-establishes the concentration of buffer or blood bicarbonate； OTI - orotracheal intubation； Mcg - micrograms； SpO，- partial oxygen saturation； AP-systolic/diastolic blood pressure； IMV -invasive mechanical ventilation； Chest-x ray - chest radiographyTetanus is a potentially fatal but preventable disease. It is caused by the Clostridium tetani toxin， a Gram-positive bac-terium that produces spores which can be found in high con centrations in soil and animal excrement . It is estimated that around 1 million cases of Clostridium tetani infection Oc-cur around the world each year， causing the deaths of about60 000 people. Most of these cases occur in Africa and Asia， where numerous programs for prevention and management have been launched. These programs have made great prog-ress， as evidenced by the 95% reduction in incidence and 99%reduction in mortality related to tetanus. These improvements have been possible thanks to increased vaccine use and the improvement of sanitary conditions . Tetanus has increased in our country of Ecuador in recent years with 49， 52， and 61cases reported in the years 2015， 2016，and 2017， respectively. Up to week 52 of 2018， 68 cases of tetanus were reported， compared to the epidemiological week 52 of 2017， in which59 cases of tetanus were reported， which shows an increase in the number of cases. The provinces that reported cases were Manabi， Pichincha， Guayas， Esmeraldas， Cotopaxi， El Oro， Orellana， Azuay， Chimborazo， Imbabura， Pastaza， Galapagos， Loja， Napo， and Tungurahua  .\n\n【8】Notably， almost all cases of tetanus occur in people who have not been immunized or who have received inadequate immunization.\n\n【9】The average incubation period is between 3 and 21 days， although its duration may be longer in inadequately protected persons. Generally， a shorter incubation period implies great-er severity of the disease . The bacteria’s spores transmit the disease. Once in the organism， the spores are converted into vegetative forms that multiply and produce tetanospas-min. This tetanus toxin inhibits the presynaptic release of the neurotransmitter's GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) and gly-cine， preventing the inhibition of motor neurons. This manifests as an increase in activity and muscle tone， causing spasms， which compromises the autonomic nervous system. In turn， this leads to sympathetic predominance， in which the neuro-toxin primarily affects the brainstem and spinal bone marrow through the retrograde axonal transport system .\n\n【10】Clinically， tetanus can present in 4 ways： generalized，neona-tal， local， and cephalic . The presentation of the generalized form is the most frequent. It is characterized by spasms that start in the masseter muscle or trismus. These then progress to more severe spasms that are terribly painful and include more regions， most commonly affecting the cervical region . During severe episodes， prolonged spasms lead to severe hypoventilation， which may be due to laryngeal spasms that result in sudden airway obstruction. This can lead to episodesof prolonged life-threatening apneas . Furthermore， the rarity of bronchial obstruction ortetanic contractions has not been evidenced by any study.\n\n【11】Patients can also develop autonomic instability， which can con-tribute to cardiac arrest. As such， it is essential to know how to identify and treat risk wounds and cases of suspected tet-anus by emergency physicians or primary care providers \n\n【12】We present a case of generalized tetanus in which we focus on the bronchial characteristics as evaluated by bronchoscopy performed in the intensive care unit (ICU).\n\n【13】Case Report\n\n【14】A 59-year-old male patient was brought by his family to the emergency department， presenting difficulty in mandibular opening (trismus)， neck stiffness， and dysphagia. He disclosed facial trauma. Edema was evidenced and pain referred at the level of the nasal bridge. When reviewing the symptoms， we noticed right facial paralysis. The only significant detail of his medical history was type II diabetes mellitus. The patient did not report having allergies and denied the use of tobacco， alco-hol， and drugs. His vital signs were the following： temperature38.4°C， blood pressure 149/94 mmHg， pulse 89 beats per min-ute， and respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. His admission laboratory tests showed leukocytes 8200 mm3 (normal range，4400 to 11 300 mm )， hemoglobin 12.9 g/dL (normal range，12 to 16 g/dL)， hematocrit 39%， (normal range， 42% to 50%)， average corpuscular volume 93 fL (normal range， 80 to 96 fL)， mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) 30.6 g/dL(normal range， 32.2 to 35.5 g/dL)， average platelet volume8.4 fL (normal range， 8.9 to 11.8 fl)， monocytes 0.45 per mm3(normal range， 0 to 0.8 per mm)， eosinophils 0.20per mm²\n\n【15】(normal range， 0 to 0.45 per mm3)， lymphocytes 0.55 per mm3(normal range， 1.0 to 4.8 per mm)， neutrophils 12.93 per mm3(normal range， 1.8 to 7.7 per mm)， basophils 0.03per mm²(normal range， 0 to 0.2 per mm)， platelets 23 2000 per mm3(normal range， 150 000 to 450 000 per mm)， red blood cell count 3.74x10/mm’ (normal range， 4.3 to 5.9x10\\*/mm)， mono-cytes (%) 7.6 (normal range， 5.3 to 12.2)， eosinophils (%) 1.6(normal range， 0.8 to 7)， lymphocytes (%) 10.8 (normal range，21.8 to 53.1)， neutrophils (%) 91.3 (normal range， 34 to 67.9)， basophils (%) 0.5 (normal range， 0.10 to 1.2)，and procalcito-nin 0.27 ng/mL (normal range，<0.046 ng/mL).\n\n【16】The patient was hospitalized， and tetanus toxoid was adminis-tered as well as antibiotic therapy (cefepime plus vancomycin1 g intravenous every 12 hours). Symptoms and signs wors-ened and resulted in acute onset of respiratory failure， severe muscle spasms， and opisthotonos； he was admitted to the ICU. An intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) mode was initiated with tidal volume (Vt) of 450 mL (8 mL/kg/weight/ideal)； inspiratory time (TI) of 1 second； flow of 45 L/minute； positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH，0； and re-spiratory rate (RR) 12-14 beats per minute at 45% FIO. For the calculation of ideal Vt， the following formula was used：55.5±2.3 (height in inches-60) for men. Patient ventilatory pa-rameters were as follows： minute volume (MV) was 8.2 L/min； exhaled Vt was 430 mL； maximum airway pressure (Pimax) was29 cmH，O； plateau pressure (Ppat) was 22 cmH，O； mean pres-sure (Pm) was 12 cmH，O； airway resistance (Raw) was 16.2 cm H，O/L/sec， and compliance (CSTA) was 46.7 mL/cmH，O. Blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.31； pCO， was 44.8 mmHg； PO， was 162.8 mmHg； HCO， was 24.4 mmol/L； base excess (EB) was- 3.4； SO， was 99%； PAO，/FIO， was 466. The patient was sedated with midazolam at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg/hour， and re-ceived analgesia with fentanyl at a dose of 1.5 mcg/kg/hour， and neuromuscular block with rocuronium bromide at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg/hour； tetanus toxoid， antibiotic therapy as well as immunoglobulin 51.18 IU/kg/weight were also provided.\n\n【17】During his stay in the ICU， the patient presented a thermal boost with leukocytosis， suggestive of a possible new pulmo-nary condition. Standard chest radiography was performed， which revealed atelectasis at the right basal level， a prominent pulmonary hila， accentuation of the bilateral bronchial vascu-lar plot， and mediastinal widening of probable vascular etiol-ogy . A flexible bronchoscopy was performed， and contraction of the bronchial rings was evidenced . A sample was taken by bronchoalveolar lavage. A Gram cul-ture and stain were performed，revealing the presence of large negative bacillus and a polymorphonuclear isolated germ， Klebsiella Pneumoniae， producing extended-spectrum B-lac-tamases (ESBL). To treat the infectious disease， a broad-spec-trum scheme was given with carbapenems and aminogly-cosides， which were sensitive according to the antibiogram performed. The patient continued to receive mechanical ven-tilatory support due to intense spasm of the respiratory tract until he had a cardiorespiratory arrest while in the ICU that did not respond to cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】The diagnosis of tetanus is primarily based on clinical find-ings. It is characterized by hypertonia with muscular contrac-tion or painful spasms . The generalized tetanus in this clin-ical case was characterized by initial involvement of the head and neck. This patient’s debut was trismus with progression toward cervical musculature expressed by a stiff neck. Among the differential diagnoses of tetanus， pathologies such as drug-induced dystonia， trismus due to dental infection， strychnine poisoning， malignant neuroleptic syndrome， or rigid person syn-drome must be excluded . Our patient had symptoms sug-gesting a clear predominance of muscular respiratory contrac-ture (a severe compromise of smooth bronchial musculature)， which we confirmed by means of bronchoscopy.\n\n【20】Additional management complications included aspiration pneumonia， laryngospasm， respiratory insufficiency， para-lytic ileus， asystole，and other symptoms . All these compli-cations， if not resolved in a timely manner， can cause death.\n\n【21】Asphyxia is the most frequent cause of death， due to larynx muscle spasms and acute obstruction of the respiratory tract. When the patient requires invasive mechanical ventilation， the prognosis is worse， because the patient will require sedation and non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents . Furthermore， autonomic dysfunction and nosocomial infec-tions like nosocomial pneumonia often caused by multi-resis-tant organisms are usually associated.\n\n【22】This patient was subjected to bronchoscopy due to the proba-ble diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia. By means of this pro-cedure， the contraction of the bronchial rings and the existence of tetany at the respiratory level were observed； these find-ings are rarely evident. It is interesting to note that， although in developed countries its incidence is very low， this infection is still an endemic disease in developing countries. Therefore， it is vital to know how to screen for， understand， and treat it.\n\n【23】Furthermore， it is important to emphasize that tetanus is en-tirely preventable through vaccination. Low and middle-income countries have the highest rates of tetanus mortality； across the world and independent of the age range， tetanus mortality also tends to be higher amongst males than females， prob-ably because of gender-based differences related to health-care seeking behaviors and cord care， occupational hazards，circumcision， and lower vaccination coverage  More gen-erally speaking， tetanus deaths are related to inadequate im-munization practices and antenatal and delivery care . Improved delivery of these basic healthcare services in upper middle-income countries like Ecuador is both possible and de-sirable as a means to prevent avoidable mortality from dis-eases like tetanus.\n\n【24】Conclusions\n\n【25】Tetanus is a potentially fatal infectious disease which，during its evolution， creates multiple complications， usually requiring intensive management and care. The diagnosis of this disease is fundamentally clinical. It should always be suspected in pa-tients who present muscle spasms after potential exposure through wounds.

In the context of increased thrombectomy performance， there have also been increased reports of rare occurrences of granulomatous inflammatory response to the hydro-philic polymer which coat many of these interventional devices.\n\n【2】Case Report： A 59-year-old female presented with a complete occlusion of her right proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) and imaging showed a large area of penumbra. Cerebral angiogram and mechanical thrombectomy were suc-cessfully performed with reversal of clinical symptoms. Eight months following her stroke， she developed pro-gressive recurrence of left-sided neurological deficits. After extensive workup culminating in tissue sampling. she was found to have developed granulomatous inflammation surrounding microscopic embolization of hy-drophilic polymer， which is used to coat many interventional devices such as wires and catheters. The patient responded both clinically and radiographically to anti-inflammatory steroid therapy.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】Recognizing the significant potential morbidity of a large vessel ischemic stroke and the expanded use of en-dovascular interventions aimed at staving off this disability， there are emerging and at times indolent compli-cations from the use of hydrophilic polymer coated wires and catheters. This rare and potentially under-rec-ognized complication should be considered in the differential for any patient with new neurological findings following cerebral intervention， especially given the consideration that this appears to a treatable complication.\n\n【5】MeSH Keywords： Neurology·Neuroradiography· Neurosurgical Procedures · ThrombectomyEndovascular intervention has become an important tool in the treatment of both arterial and venous thromboembolic events. With the recent publication of a number of multicenter， open-label， randomized controlled trials  that demonstrated the safety and efficacy of endovascular mechanical thrombectomy for select patients presenting with documented proximal large artery occlusive ischemic strokes in the anterior circulation， the utilization of the procedure as a viable adjunct to medical management in acute stroke will likely continue to increase in frequency. Hydrophilic polymers used to coat endovascular devices in order to reduce friction have been associated with embolization and subsequent complications. However， the fre-quency of these embolization events and complications remain undetermined. Given the widespread use of these procedures， certain complications are becoming more evident， including acute granulomatous inflammatory response to the hydrophilic polymer which often coats the devices used to perform these procedures. This phenomenon has been observed following endovascular interventions in the anterior and posterior ce-rebral circulation ， pulmonary thrombectomy ， cardiac catheterization ， vascular catheterization with kidney involvement and acute renal failure ， as well aspolymer embolization to the skin  and meninges . This is often an acute response after catheter intervention. However， as shown in our case， as well as other documented cases ， there is potential for delayed granuloma-tous inflammation occurring a few to several months follow-ing the intervention.\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】Our patient was a 59-year-old female with a history of chron-ic headaches in addition to chronic neck and back pain， who presented to the emergency department with left-sided motor deficits. Initial imaging consisted of head CT showing a dense right middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory infarct， with CT perfusion studies suggesting a large area of penumbra. She received tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) two hours after symptom onset. Cerebral angiogram and uncomplicated throm-bectomy were performed within four hours of symptom onset resulting in excellent reperfusion . The proce-dure was conducted with a Neuron Max guide， 5MAX ACE，and a 3MAX cerebral reperfusion catheter over a Fathom guidewire by femoral artery access. The patient's post-operative course was complicated by a small hemorrhagic transformation twodays following tPA and thrombectomy. Her ischemic cerebro-vascular accident was attributed to paradoxical embolism af-ter a transthoracic echocardiogram showed right to left shunt-ing at the atrial septum and incidental left main pulmonary embolism detected on CT angiography of the neck. She sub-sequently underwent inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement. Two months later， she had progressive left-sided weakness and was found to have a subdural hematoma， which was treated with a burr hole evacuation. Following this， she had resolu-tion of left hemiparesis without any other observable deficit.\n\n【8】Four months after her stroke， she presented with worsening of left-sided weakness. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) of the brain demonstrated no new ischemic insult and resolving changes from the initial infarct and hemorrhagic transformation . This improved after narcotic med-ications were decreased and was attributed to recrudescence from medication side effect.\n\n【9】Eight months after her stroke， she developed progressive worsening of baseline headache and recurrence of left hemi-paresis with new right gaze preference. Repeat MRl imagingshowed a lesion with progressive confluent T2 hyperintensi-ty  with greater than 30 admixed punctate ar-eas ofenhancement， involving cortex and white matter of the right parietal， temporal， and occipital lobes on T1 . Diagnostic brain biopsy of the lesion was identified as necro-tizing granulomatous inflammation secondary to hydrophilic polymer embolization . She was treated with pulse dose methylprednisolone for five days followed by a slow taper of 60 mg prednisone daily dropping by 10 mg ev-ery three days to 20 mg daily. At the time of discharge， the patient had near complete recovery of her left lower extrem-ity strength， partial recovery of left upper extremity strength， with recovery of headaches to near baseline. Follow-up im-aging six-weeks after steroid therapy showed significant im-provement of her inflammatory response with post inflamma-tory ex-vacuation .\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Based upon the sheer number of enhancing T1 lesions， the lack of filling defects， and the presence of inflammation through-out the entirety of the MCA distribution， we felt that this pa-tient case was likely the result of device showering emboli throughout the procedure rather than an isolated procedural event such as a shearing of a guide wire. Fortunately， many of the symptoms documented in our patient's case，and oth-er reported cases， have responded to anti-inflammatory treat-ment， including steroid therapy. However， hydrophilic polymer associated embolization may be under recognized. It should be a consideration in all patients with meningitis， multifocal in-farction， or multifocal enhancing lesions on MRl in a large ar-tery vascular territory following endovascular procedures. With heightened awareness， early recognition and intervention， wemay be able to decrease medical costs， improve clinical out-comes， and decrease the extent of post-intervention compli-cations. Despite the absence of a standard of care governing the manipulation of these intravascular devices and the treat-ment of granulomatous inflammatory complications， there are a few recommendations set forth by the FDA regarding peri-procedure precautions interventionists can take to minimize hydrophilic polymer embolization. The recommendations in-clude： avoiding use of catheters outside of theirindication； leav-ing enough space between catheters and introducer sheaths； using care when maneuvering the devices； and replacing de-vices when needed to avoid overuse . In our patient， high dose corticosteroid treatment with an initial pulse dose regi-men of methylprednisolone followed by a slow taper， showed efficacy in decreasing the inflammation and improving symp-toms. Lorentzen et al.  reported successful clinical response to methylprednisolone at 16 mg， four times a day adminis-tered for four weeks， in the case of a patient who sustained cerebral granulomatous inflammation at three-month post-hydrophilic polymer embolization which was reported three months post-intervention for cerebral aneurysm intervention. Shapiro et al.  discussed two cases where a right trigem-inal and para-ophthalmic aneurysm repair through a femoral artery access resulted in neurological sequelae that manifest-ed two months post-procedure. Both cases documented com-plete clinical resolution and absence of perilesional edema on follow-up imaging after treatment with a two-month course of dexamethasone. However， the duration and optimal dosing of corticosteroids to maintain sustained remission of this for-eign body inflammatory response remains to be determined. The increasing incidence of this problem should prompt de-vice makers to take this into account as they continue to de-velop this technology.\n\n【12】This rare and potentially under-recognized adverse reaction should be considered in the differential diagnosis of post en-dovascular intervention patients who display new or worsen ing symptoms. The importance of early diagnosis lies in both the potential for palliating inadvertent procedure-associat-ed complications and the severity of pathology if it remains unrecognized.\n\n【13】We thank the Mayo Clinical Laboratories for assistance with the pathology evaluation of the tissue sample.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "48a3eb82-f063-46cf-9d19-b13957526fd1", "title": null, "text": "【0】ABSTRACT Cancer accounts for 20% of the causes of death and occupies the second place as a reason of mortality after cardiovascular disease， but the incidence of childhood cancer is little (less than 1% of new cases in western populations). However， in many countries， it is the second or third cause of death in children. All around the world， the main reasons causing death in children are accidents and inadequate nutrition. In countries where this trend has declined， cancer has become the leading cause of death in this young population. Almost 50% of malignancies occur in children aged 0-5years. Today， cancer is considered a threatening disease for both children and adolescents， but not always fatal. However， not only is it essential to cure the biological cognition but also the psychological (i.e. to know that the child or teenager has cancer) and the social aspect (the reintegration of the child and adolescent into society without stigma). The scope of this study is to investigate the current clinical and psychological management of young patients and childrento reintegrate children and adolescents into social life smoothly.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS cancer； children； stress； fear； management； adolescents\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Significant improvements in life expectancy have been achieved in children and adolescents with cancer. Between 1975 and 2010， childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50% with the right treatment， the rates of cure can be as high as 80%，as it has been shown in high-income societies. Survival rates of children with cancer are high， at almost 80% in high-income countries. More than 80% of all childhood cancer cases occur in low and middle-income countries. Although nearly 175000cancer cases are diagnosed in children younger than 15 years of age， unfortunately， fewer than 40% of childhood cancers are diagnosed or receive early and effective treatment J. Delay in early diagnosis is a result of similarity in signs and symptoms of childhood cancers and common diseases in young children .\n\n【4】In children， cancer manifests itself more often as a systemic disease rather than as a solid tumour. Another difference is that solid tumours of childhood are mainly blasts and sarcomas， while epithelial-type cancer is rare. Two of the most prominent human oncogenic viruses are hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hu-man papillomavirus (HPV). HBV infection has been preventable by vaccination since 1982； vaccination of neonates and infants is highly effective， resulting in decreased rates of new infec-tions， chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma . Human papillomavirus (HPV)， a sexually transmitted infection， can cause warts and some cancers. Epidemiology and pathol-ogy of ovarian tumours in the pediatric population differ from those of women. Abdominal pain was the most predominant symptom in the non-malignant lesion group .\n\n【5】Wim's tumour\n\n【6】We now know other cases of cancer whose aetiology is based on the lack of both normal alleles of an oncostatic gene. One example is Wilm's cancer， a child's kidney cancer that affects one in 10，000 children who are born. Wilm’s cancer cases account for5% of all cancers in children. Both sporadic and familial caseshave been reported. In its hereditary form， Wilm’s cancer is transmitted as an autosomal dominant feature with a variety of expressions .\n\n【7】Retinoblastoma\n\n【8】Until 1850， retinoblastoma was a lethal childhood cancer. The slow progress of this cancer was the result of a gradual brain injury. The discovery of the microscope (1850， Herman von Helmholtz)， made it possible to perform early surgical excision before its spread to neighbouring tissues with fatal results. At the same time， its family dependence was also known. Young people with a hereditary defective gene are healthy but have an increased risk of developing cancer. Since the presence of a single normal Rb gene is enough for a person to be healthy， it is believed that this is a residual disease. Because individuals with a mutated allele of the Rb gene transfer it on average to half of their children， cloning of this gene allows prenatal diagnosis of the disease. By the use of this method， risk assessment can be carried out for retinoblastoma in the fetus before birth .\n\n【9】Pigmentary dry skin\n\n【10】In 1968， James Cleaver， studying a medical article on patients with sun-sensitive hypersensitivity， discovered that the cells derived from these patients are unable to eliminate ultraviolet radiation damage to the DNA. This disease is called pigmented dry skin disease and is characterised by extreme skin sensitivity in exposure to sunlight， occurring mainly in the early years of life. The parts of the skin exposed to sunlight are covered with dye stains， and skin lesions develop into malignant tumours.\n\n【11】The prognosis is bleak for these patients， and death generally happens between the 20th and 25th year of age. Based on this disease， it has been shown that the persistence of DNA damage to human cells， caused by exposure to the sun， is directly linked with the onset of cancers .\n\n【12】Even an episode of causing the sun's heat from excessive exposure to the sun， especially in childhood， may be enough to cause melanoma in these patients. Epidemiological data seems to reinforce the view that the reduction in sun exposure should go so far as to prevent sunburn， especially in childhood. What should be emphasised to parents of young children is to protect them from the intense sun exposure during the summer months. Children and people with light skin should use creams with a protective index of at least 10 or higher according to the sun’s intensity.\n\n【13】Ewing Sarcoma\n\n【14】Ewing Sarcoma is the second most frequent malignant bone tumour in adolescents and young adults. The majority of Ewing sarcoma develops in bones； however 15-20% of Ewing sarcoma originates in the soft tissue surrounding bones . When first reported by James Ewing， in his first reports in 1921， pro-posed an endothelial origin for the sarcoma based on its cellular morphology and rareness of stroma. In 1971 a myelogenous origin of Ewing sarcoma was proposed given ultrastructural features resembling developing myelocytes. Since then， several hypotheses regarding the histogenesis of Ewing sarcoma have been expressed， with neural crest cells and mesenchymal stem cells receiving the most attention as the putative cells of origin. For Ewing sarcoma， the 5-year survival rate has increased over the same time from 59% to 78% for children younger than 15years and from 20% to 60% in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years. Patients with Ewing sarcoma in the distal extremities have the best prognosis .\n\n【15】The second most common tumour in this group， called neurob-lastoma， is characterised by a heterogeneous clinical behaviour， ranging from spontaneous regression to aggressive and inex-orable disease . Fifty per cent of cases are considered high risk， with long-term survival rates after multimodal chemo- and immunotherapy below 40% . Neuroblastoma can develop either sporadically or be transmitted in the germline. If a tumour involves the spinal cord， cord compression or paralysis may be seen. Diagnostic evaluation relies not only on a careful history and physical examination， but also on biochemical， histologic， and radiographic analyses. Histologic confirmation is required to establish a diagnosis of neuroblastoma .\n\n【16】Leukaemia\n\n【17】Leukaemia is the most common malignant disease in children. It affects children of the white race rather than black. It may occur at any age， but 50% of children are aged 0-5 years. Acute lym-phoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most frequent cancer among children. Current risk-adapted treatments and supportive care have increased the survival rate to over 90% in the developed countries. However， approximately 20% of children who relapse have a poor prognosis， making leukaemia the leading cause of cancer mortality in pediatric disorders. Feature selection usu-ally plays a significant role in machine learning， as irrelevant attributes may lead to low accuracy， less interpreted and over-fitting results in classification analysis. The prognosis of a child with malignant disease depends on： the histological type， the degree of differentiation， the characteristics of the biological be-haviour， the extent of a tumour， the general condition of the child. Treatment depends on the type of leukaemia. However， mainly treatment is chemotherapy. The prediction of relapse in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is a critical factor for successful treatment and follow-up planning .\n\n【18】Malignant Lymphomas\n\n【19】Malignant lymphomas belong to the group of systemic dis-eases and are divided into two groups： a. Hodgkin's disease or Hodgkin's lymphoma， non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Lymphoma is one of the most common cancers in adolescent and young adults. The treatment of malignant lymphoma is dependent on the type of lymphoma. Hodgkin’s disease in children is usually treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is mainly treated with chemotherapy. Both treatment and prognosis of pediatric non-Hodgkin lym-phoma (NHL) have improved dramatically in the last 30 years. Currently， localized or limited-stage NHL (stage I to II) has an approximately 95%-100% 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate.\n\n【20】Furthermore， the prognosis for children with advanced-stage disease (stage III to Ⅳ) has doubled from approximately 40%5-year EFS 30 years ago to more than 80%. Hodgkin lymphoma is also known to have around 80% 10-year EFS rate. Hodgkin Lymphoma is curable in more than 90% of cases. Even though children have good outcomes when treated with risk-adapted strategies， adolescents who are between 15 and 18 years old seem to experience poorer survival rates， whereas patients older than 18 years old have globally the same outcome than older adults. This category of patients needs particular care， based on tight coordination between adults and pediatric oncologists. In conclusion， adolescent and young adults'lymphomas are curable diseases but require personalized management in onco-haematological units .\n\n【21】Rhabdomyosarcoma is a highly malignant tumour in children and is characterized by a high recurrence rate and presence of metastases . It originates from immature striated muscles and is mainly found in the head， neck， extremities and geni-tourinary system . Although multimodal therapy including wide excision， radiotherapy， and dose-intensive chemotherapy is used to treat RMS， those ways of treatment are not available for RMS patients with relapse or distant metastases . Child-hood rhabdomyosarcoma is a soft tissue malignant tumour of mesenchymal origin. It accounts for approximately 3.5% of the cases of cancer among children aged 0 to 14 years and 2% of the cases among adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 19 years. All children with rhabdomyosarcoma should receive chemotherapy. The intensity and duration of the chemotherapy are dependent on the Risk Group assignment .\n\n【22】intracranial tumours\n\n【23】As presenting symptoms are considered the following：：a headache (31%)， vomiting (31%)， seizures (21%)， and be-havioural change (11%). The most prevalent symptoms in this diagnosis were a headache (51%)， vomiting (51%)， visual dif-ficulties (37%)， seizures (24%)， and behavioural change (21%). A headache and vomiting are the earliest and most prevalent symptoms in children with brain tumours. Visual symptoms and behavioural change are often present. Abnormalities in the neurological examination are reported in most of the children.\n\n【24】The most common brain tumour in children is the astrocy-toma. Surgical tumour exclusion is the primary therapeutic approach. Total resection should be achieved as these tumours often recur rapidly .\n\n【25】Psychosocial Aspects of children and adolescent can-cer diagnosis\n\n【26】The diagnosis of cancer is a traumatic event that puts children and adolescents at an increased risk for adjustment problems and adverse psychological outcomes . It can be disruptive to emotional and may have detrimental effects on the cognitive and social development of the individual， a process by which young people develop self-views， social cognition， awareness， and emotional well-being . Coping with the disease presents new challenges： the diagnosis phase， the phase of treatment and the post-treatment or remission phase .\n\n【27】Developmental perspective\n\n【28】In infants and preschoolers， emotion self- regulation becomes understandable from a dyadic perspective because the primary caregiver is central to providing regulation that a small child needs. For example， maternal depression can lead to emotional distress in preschoolers and results in externalised symptoms such as aggressive behaviour . On the other hand， young patients of pre-school age rarely experience hair loss or weight gain as a major problem . In children， coping with a cancer diagnosis varies， depending on the child’s temperament and coping style . They are often annoyed by physical changes as those affect their image to others. For preadolescent children， fre-quent hospitalisations， invasive medical procedures， and physi-cal symptoms are associated with significant distress. Cancer has adverse impacts on behavioural， emotional and social aspects as well as in their learning development and well-being .\n\n【29】Current studies have shown that it is directly linked to isola-tion from family members and missed opportunities in school and peer activities J. During adolescence， individuals are trying to develop their identity and independence from their parents， while peer relationships become their predominant ac-tivities. Cancer therapy often requires increased dependence from parents and social isolation from peers， which can chal-lenge their need for autonomy. Adolescents and young adults diagnosed with cancer frequently face the loss of their body image， sexuality， fertility and their imagined future in general.\n\n【30】Emotional distress and psychosocial considerations\n\n【31】Children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are at risk of depression due to disruptions in their developmental trajectory and the tremendous physical symptom burden they suffer . They experience emotional distress such as post-traumatic stress symptoms， anxiety ， obsessive-compulsive disorders ， sadness， irritability  and the perpetual fear of recurrence . Late adolescents are at higher risk for severe depression within the first year following a cancer diagnosis. It is challenging to estimate with accuracy the incidence of depressive disorders because the co-occurrence of physical symptoms such as fatigue， anorexia， and sleep disruption are frequent in both diagnoses. What is for sure is that the interruptions in expected life roles， body image perception and peer relations are significant sources of psychological and existential concern and contribute to depression.\n\n【32】Cancer has also been described as a potential moderator of school life as it disrupts the educational process due to absen-teeism and poor performance in tests .Illness uncertainty surrounding the severity， the treatment and prognosis are iden-tified as another significant stressor for children with a cancer diagnosis .\n\n【33】Family system and its functioning comprise a crucial role in the emotional distress in pediatric cancer . Parental involve-ment during treatment may complicate the natural progression towards independence. Disruptions in family routines and rela-tionships and parental work-life changes  are potential risk factors for maladjustment . A cancer experience may also in-clude a higher risk of social isolation， and late adolescents often report missing out on critical social activities during their treat-ment. Thus， the consequences of cancer on relationships with parents， siblings and peers may manifest the need for support， while healthy relationships are a key component of well-being.\n\n【34】Psychotherapeutic interventions\n\n【35】Children with cancer spend a period using intensive multimodal therapies with transient and milder side effects. They have much stress due to the unknown hospital environment and the differ-ent faces of nursing and medical staff which seem unfamiliar to them. Recent surveys have shown that cortisol levels were lower among children who were able to receive further information regarding the operation and process in comparison to children who were unprepared. Also， the absence of familiar persons multiplied the problematic behaviour with symptoms such as crying，dystopia and lack of tendency to explore.On the contrary， the presence of intimate persons has had positive effects such as a tendency for exploration (asking questions， approaching organs， etc.)， a reduction in self-centred and escapetendencies(such as running towards the exit or having actions of panic attacks).In conclusion， the younger the patient， the more intense the behavioural problems were (crying， food denial， protests， regressions，etc.).\n\n【36】The general approach is to talk to the child about the illness. At an early age， the child is better acquainted with the adult world by playing toys， doll rolls (for example， doctor， nurse， patient)， special toys such as plastic medical instruments， injec-tions. Puppet theatre also enables us to play everything that's happening. This method is called gynaecology therapy and is applied by special pediatric psychologists and other specialised staff. Gaming therapy helps the child overcome his unpleasant feelings and fears of being admitted to the hospital .\n\n【37】Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) provided via the Inter-net is a promising treatment modality for a range of conditions， increasing access to support for parents of children who are re-ceiving treatment for cancer .Research has reported that less than half of parents who report a need to see a psychologist have had the opportunity to take part in this.\n\n【38】Most adolescents respond well enough because they have great adaptability . Literature suggests that children and adolescents with a cancer diagnosis demonstrate comparable or lower levels of distress about those without a history of serious illness. It is evidenced that children with cancer do not differ from healthy ones with regards to psychological functioning 一problems that those experience may become better attributed to factors other than cancer，such as stressful life events and family dysfunctional environment . It is essential that a physician's empathetic attitude can also have a positive influence on psy-chological adjustments giving opportunities to discuss feelings about thee nnewly diagnosed cancer patients . Adolescent sup-port groups have been proven to increase cooperation between peers and with their therapists .\n\n【39】Conclusion\n\n【40】While diseases in childhood are mainly described as common incidents in the early stages of children’s life， cancer incidents cannot be attributed as facts directly related to the child and teenager； a certain variety of neoplasms dominate in childhood. The day of diagnosing cancer in this young population has al-ways been a painful day for both patients and their families.\n\n【41】It is apparent that the occurrence of cancer in a child is a trau-matic experience and carries significant impacts on both patients and their families. Primary psychological and social support should focus more on the emotional relief of those patients and families rather than the health consequences of the disease and its treatment. Moreover， palliative care for pediatric patients is confronted with many challenges， which can include cost， avail-ability， and timing of referrals. It is of great importance to have a comprehensive and meaningful psychological intervention in those cases， which will improve the quality of life for those patients. Last but not least， we should always bear in mind that psychological care for children and adolescents with cancer has particularities that require： knowledge， clinical experience， ongoing education， sensitivity， humanity， and above all courage and courage.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

In about 20% of patients， AITDs are associated with another organ specific/systemic autoimmune disorders. Currently， the treatment of hypothyroidism is the daily intake of synthetic levothyroxine as replacement therapy. The Remember/Regeneration Therapy Method (RTM) is a novel holistic medicine approach that targets physiopathological changes in quadruplet body structures and includes various complementary methods such as acupuncture， ozone therapy and phytotherapy， etc. in different combinations which are determined depending on affected diseases. Case Report： We present a Hashimoto's disease case which was serologically diagnosed and successfully healed with the RTM therapy without a significant side effects. Conclusion： RTM may provide consistent results for HT and many similar diseases by using combinations of various holistic medicine methods in different doses， durations and sessions. The identification of epigenetically regulated genes related to HT may be promising in order to develop epigenetic drugs for disease management. For that purpose， further scientific studies are needed.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis， RTM， Holistic Medicine， Epigenetic\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT)， which causes hypothyroidism， is the most common pathology among autoimmune thyroid disorders (AITD's). At the cellular level， the disease is character-ized by lymphocyte infiltration， especially T cells， and follicular destruction， resulting in atrophy and fibrosis. At the molecu-lar level， cytokines and chemokines play a role in autoimmune pathology of the disease. In about 20% of patients， AITDs are associated with another organ specific/systemic autoimmune disorders . Novel scientific data show that epigenetics has been considered to exert essential roles in integrating of geneticand environmental factors， and altered epigenetic status caused by environmental factors may drive susceptibility individuals genetically to develop AITD's .\n\n【4】Currently， the standard treatment of hypothyroidism is the daily intake of synthetic levothyroxine as replacement therapy. However， hormone replacement therapy provides relief of symp-toms and complaints in the majority of patients while optimal recovery cannot be achieved in a small number of patients . Although there have been many scientific studies on HT so far， no treatment has been found to cure patients completely. Vita-min D and selenium supplementations as well as the current hormone supplementation therapy have also been shown to have a useful effect on HT cases as promising developments At the same time， some scientific studies showing the ef-fects of complementary and traditional medical methods on the disease have also started to beincluded in the scientific literature.\n\n【5】The Remember/Regeneration Therapy Method (RTM) is a holistic approach which consists of diagnostic and treatment systems that include mainly phytotherapy and different combi-nations of various complementary and traditional medical meth-ods such as acupuncture， cupping therapy， hirudotherapy， ozone therapy， etc. Phytotherapy is the main and pivot part of the RTM while the other treatment modalities are used in order to support the effect of the phytotherapy. Moreover， in phytotherapeutic ap-plications of RTM， two main groups of phytotherapeutics called“Remember Herbs\"and\"Regeneration Herbs\" which consist of different amounts of various medical herbs are used. On the other hand， according to the RTM model， diseases are seen as the reflection of epigenetic changes in the phenotype resulting from the gene-environment mismatch. The treatment strategy is based on the recovery of health by substantially improving the deteriorating structures. It has been considered that the patho-logical process of a disease can potentially be reversed by the RTM， considering the epigenetic changes. It has been clinically observed that epigenetic changes and irregularities improved when appropriate treatment protocols were applied， as in the RTM model .\n\n【6】In this case report， we present a case with HT who is amelio-rated clinically and serologically due to the RTM phytotherapeu-tics. The case was followed up periodically for one year in order to show that the RTM provided a cure. Possible mechanisms of the effect of the RTM and the recovery process of a patient with HT after the beginning of the RTM will be discussed.\n\n【7】Case report\n\n【8】The case was a 21-vear-old female with HT and was suffering from the disease for about one year. There was no family story and any stress factor which trigger the disease. The case was cured with RTM phytotherapeutics consists of different herbal extracts. The following RTM phytotherapeutics was used for the case for 12 months approximately.\n\n【9】·DVD.KBRT，3\\*4 (A mixture with thistle)\n\n【10】· ISY.CP， 3\\*4 (A mixture with nettle leaf)\n\n【11】·IST.ARD，3\\*1 (A mixture with thistle seed and Juniper fruit)·DTX19.3\\*1\n\n【12】Follow up period and the diagnostic results\n\n【13】The patient was called for follow up periodically， and physi-cal examination and other practices were performed. Clinical findings or complaints were not observed during the follow-up period of 1 year. Briefly， the case was completely healed and all complaints are disappeared almost with RTM within 11 months. Also， the all-healing process was supported by the improvement in antibodies . Any adverse effect due to RTM was not detected. The therapy exhibited a desirable safety outline and was associated with a good response.\n\n【14】Limitations\n\n【15】In this study， we could not use molecular methods to explain the mechanism of action of RTM in terms of epigenetic regulation. Since the case was out of control of our clinic before RTM treat-ment， she applied to us without epigenetic analysis. Therefore， we could not show the possible mechanism about the epigenetic process. The fact that the study was a retrospective study also contributed to this deficiency.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Novel scientific discoveries in the sciences of biology and ge-netics have demonstrated that inheritance has a whole new di-mension beyond the genes， not in the structure of the DNA.\n\n【18】In this new dimension of inheritance called epigenetics， it has been shown that changes can be transferred to new generations. The importance of epigenetic modifications in long-term memory performance has been demonstrated in the most ex-tensive and comprehensive study on DNA methylation. The processes such as chromatin remodelling， histone modifications， and non-coding RNA are also other significant changes that belong to epigenetic mechanisms .\n\n【19】The development of AITD is related to many factors， includ-ing genetic and environmental. It has been found that some thyroid-specific genetic factors are associated with AITD， such as TSHR gene and thyroglobulin (TG) gene polymorphisms.\n\n【20】DNA hypomethylation， one of the most common epigenetic mechanisms，has been shown to exist in AITD patients.DNA hy-pomethylation may cause the overexpression of some genes in-volved in immune function or the activation of immune cells and eventually autoimmune attack toward thyroid tissues . Besides DNA methylation， histone modifications and other epi-genetic mechanisms are highly dynamic， and are regulated by“writer\"and\"eraser\" enzymes . Histone modifications have been shown to play a role in autoimmune diseases by mod-ulating immune tolerance. As promising treatment strategies， some small-molecule inhibitors targeting histone-modifying enzymes also provide new treatment options for dis-eases such as cancers and autoimmune diseases . In addition to these drugs that work at molecular levels， many phytochemi-cals have been shown to be effective on certain conditions such as cancer chemoprevention and metabolic syndrome through epigenetic regulation .\n\n【21】The RTM is a holistic medicine that describes the anatomi-cal and physiological aspects of physiopathological changes in quadruplet body structures (QBSs). The RTM phytotherapeutics which consists of a unique mixture of different herbal ingredi-ents in different proportions， and they placed the centre of the RTM. Also， when it is needed， many complementary medical methods such as acupuncture， ozone therapy， cupping therapy， hirudotherapy， etc. may add to the RTM phytotherapeutics that is the significant axis of the model. In the RTM， diseases are seen as the reflection of epigenetic changes in the phenotype resulting from the gene-environment mismatch. The treatment strategy is based on the recovery of health by substantially improving the deteriorating structures. Considering that many of the epige-netic changes which lead to disease can potentially be reversed， it has been clinically observed that epigenetic changes and irreg-ularities improved with appropriate treatment protocols were applied， as in the RTM. Thus， firstly， these extraordinary and ab-normal conditions that lead to the gene-environment mismatch should be eliminated， and secondly， previous normal physio-logical processes should be reminded to the body. Already， the name of RTM comes from the special treatment strategy that composes of proper combinations of regenerative and reminder phytotherapeutic agents and holistic medicine methods .\n\n【22】There are some laboratory tests to diagnose thyroid diseases. TSH and free thyroid hormone tests are frequently used to de-tect the disorders in thyroid functions while thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO-Ab) test is used to diagnose HT . Serum thyroglobulin antibody (Tg-Ab) is a marker of autoimmune dis-eases of the thyroid gland. Since serum Tg-Ab is found to be elevated in 10% of the general population (especially in women)， it is not as sensitive or specific as the thyroid biomarker com-pared to TPO-Ab or TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb). In caseswhere TPO-Ab is not increased， TgAb is not significantly asso-ciated with thyroid disease. TPO-Ab is found in 5-20% of the general population while it is always elevated in patients with HT almost 271.\n\n|  | Hashimoto's Thyroiditis Case， Female， 21 Years Old  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Therapeutics， Doses and Duration of RTM  | DVD-KBRT 3\\*4 ISY-CP 3\\*4 IST-ARD 3\\*1 DTX 19 3\\*1  | 12 Months  |\n| Symptoms Before RTM  | Intense hair loss； Intense brittle nails； Intense acne  |  |\n| Symptoms After RTM  | Significant reduction in all symptoms  |  |\n| Follow Up Period without Disease and Synthetic Levothyroxine  | 1 Year  |  |\n\n【24】Table 2 The variation in values of hormones and antibodies of the case before and after the RTM.\n\n| Hashimato's Thyroiditis Case， Female， 21 Years Old  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| AnalyzeDate  | T3\\* 2.3-4.2 pg/mL  | T4\\* 0.8-1.8 ng/dL  | TSH\\* 0.4-4.5 mIU/L  | Anti TPO\\*<35 IU/mL  | Anti TG\\* <20 IU/mL  |\n| 03.17.2015  | 3.76  | 0.94  | 10.78  | 107  | 328  |\n| 05.08.2015  | The Beginning of the RTM  |  |  |  |  |\n| 09.14.2015  | 3.72  | 0.99  | 10.51  | 103  | 323  |\n| 04.15.2016  | The cessation of the RTM  |  |  |  |  |\n| 04.15.2016  | 3.70  | 1.06  | 3.32  | 47.9  | 49.3  |\n| 05.18.2017  | 3.22  | 1.3  | 2.47  | <28  | 31  |\n| \\*Normal Ranges in Conventional Medicine  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n【26】\\*Normal Ranges in Conventional Medicine\n\n【27】In the current case， the hormones and antibodies were signif-icantly decreased by our treatment model. Moreover， all com-plaints disappeared almost when compared to before treatment. It is more likely that the efficacy on all parameters is related to possible smart molecules which regulate epigenetic modification found in RTM phytotherapeutics.\n\n【28】Conclusion\n\n【29】As a conclusion， The RTM treatment was well tolerated by the patient with HT and no side effects were observed. The identifi-cation of epigenetically regulated genes related to HT may be promising in order to develop epigenetic drugs for disease man-agement. However， further functional studies might be required to determine epigenetically regulated genes in HT.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

We report this case to describe florid interstitial hemorrhages as a novel feature of Amoxicillin-Clavulanate-induced acute tubuloint-erstitial nephritis.\n\n【2】Case Report： A young man presented with intermittent visible hematuria and acute kidney injury after a course of Amoxicillin-Clavulanate for upper respiratory tract illness. Renal biopsy demonstrated acute tubulointerstitial nephritis with multifocal intense interstitial hemorrhages， intratubular red blood cells， and red blood cell casts. At the same time， he was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Leukemic cellular infiltration and other potential causes of tubulointerstitial nephritis were ruled out.\n\n【3】Conclusions： Drug-induced tubulointerstitial nephritis can be associated with florid interstitial hemorrhages. This can lead to an atypical clinicopathological presentation of tubulointerstitial nephritis， masquerading as glomerulone-phritis， vasculitis， or infectious interstitial nephritis.\n\n【4】Keywords： Amoxicillin· Hematuria·Hemorrhage·Nephritis， Interstitial\n\n【5】Over two-thirds of tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) cases are drug-induced， most commonly due to non-steroidal anti-in-flammatory agents and antibiotics. Beta-lactam antibiotics are among the worst precipitating agents， causing tubuloint-erstitial nephritis in days to weeks following exposure via cell-mediated immunity .\n\n【6】The histopathological hallmark of drug-induced TIN is inter-stitial edema associated with inflammatory cells， within the renal interstitium， whereas the giomeruli and blood vessels are spared . Interstitial infiltrates are mostly composed of lymphocytes， macrophages， eosinophils and plasma cells. Sometimes， interstitial granulomas may be observed. The usu-al renal presentation is with acute/subacute kidney injury as-sociated with pyuria， white blood cell casts， microscopic he-maturia， and low-grade proteinuria .\n\n【7】We report this case to describe florid interstitial hemorrhag-es as a novel feature of Amoxicillin-Clavulanate-induced TIN. This was associated with visible hematuria and red blood cell casts， which are features uncharacteristic of TIN.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 33-year-old Arab male patient was admitted via the emer-gency department with intermittent painless visible hematu-ria of 3 weeks'duration. Three weeks before the onset of he-maturia， he had a throat infection for which he took a 2-week course of Amoxicillin-Clavulanate. He denied any previous ep-isodes of hematuria， family history of renal disease， intake of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents or any medication other than Amoxicillin-Clavulanate. One week before admission， he had consulted a physician for bilateral flank pain. At that time， laboratory tests revealed a serum creatinine of 106 umol/L mi-croscopic hematuria， and pyuria. The coagulation profile was normal. A non-contrast computed tomography scan ruled out nephrolithiasis， pyelonephritis， and urinary tract obstruction.\n\n【10】At the time of admission， the patient was apyrexial. Blood pres-sure was 127/79 mmHg. There was no evidence of skin rash， arthritis， or facial/peripheral edema. Posterior cervical， supra-clavicular， and axillary lymphadenopathy was noted. Lymph nodes were 2-3 cm in size， non-tender， and mobile. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Basic laborato-ry studies  disclosed severe renal dys-function，with serum creatinine of 466 umol/L. This was asso-ciated with hematuria， pyuria， and low-grade proteinuria， but no bacteriuria or crystaluria. A Doppler ultrasound scan of the kidneys was normal. Renal biopsy was organized to exclude rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and tubulointerstitialnephritis. A peripheral blood smear demonstrated eosinophil-ia， monocytosis， and circulating blast cells， prompting urgent bone marrow examination. An immunology workup was neg ative for antinuclear， anti-glomerular basement membrane， and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Serum C3 and C4 levels were normal. Serology was negative for HBV， HCV， and HIV， and serum protein electrophoresis did not show any monoclonal bands.\n\n【11】A renal biopsy was performed on day 2 of admission. All salient histopathological findings were limited to the interstitial com-partment and tubules. The cortical and medullary interstitium was edematous and infiltrated with a mixture of lymphocytes， plasma cells， and eosinophils . However， the most striking feature was florid multifocal interstitial hemorrhages. Abundant red blood cells in several tubules and red blood cell casts in some tubules were also seen. The glomer-uli appeared normal， with patent capillary lumina and normal thickness of the capillary walls. No red blood cells were noted in the Bowman's spaces. Direct immunofluorescence studies did not show any significant deposition of immunoglobulins(lgG， IgA， and IgM)， complement components (C3，C1q)，fibrin-ogen， or kappa/lambda light chains. Small arteries and arteri-oles were within normal limits. Mild (5-10%) focal tubular at-rophy and interstitial fibrosis was seen. Hence， a diagnosis of drug-induced acute TIN was made. Bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy was done on day 3 of admission； flow cy-tometry confirmed the diagnosis of T cell acute lymphoblas-tic leukemia. The diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia broadened the differential diagnosis of renal dysfunction， as kidney injury from leukemia or its complications is well rec-ognized. Immunohistochemical staining was carried out by an experienced hematopathologist to detect possible leukemic in-filtration； staining was negative for TdT， CD10， CD7，CD99， and CD56. SV40 antibody staining for BK virus was also negative.\n\n【12】The patient was transferred to the Hematology/Oncology Center. Treatment of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia was initiated according to the UKALL 14 protocol on day 6 of admis-sion. At that time， serum creatinine was 822 umol/L， although the patient remained non-oliguric with no significant electro-lyte or acid-base disturbances.Dexamethasone was given at a dose of 16 mg/day for 7 days (Steroid-Pre-phase) followed by3 pulses of Dexamethasone (20mg/day for 4 days each) com-bined with Vincristine， Daunorubicin， Pegylated Asparaginase， and Methotrexate as phase 1 of induction chemotherapy. It was felt that the glucocorticoid component of this therapeu-tic regimen will constitute an effective therapy for TIN as well. Serum creatinine levels started to decrease 3 days after ini-tiation of Dexamethasone，decreasing to 80 umol/L8 weeks later . Eosinophilia， hematuria， and proteinuria re-solved by 2 weeks， 4 weeks， and 6 weeks， respectively， after initiation of steroid therapy. The patient traveled abroad forstem cell transplantation after receiving the second phase of induction therapy.\n\n| Test  | Result  | Reference  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hemoglobin (gm/dL)  | 14.2  | 13-17  |\n| White blood cells (x10/uL)  | 9.6  | 4-10  |\n| Neutrophils (%)  | 41.5  | 55-70  |\n| Lymphocytes (%)  | 22.7  | 20-40  |\n| Monocytes (%)  | 18.2  | 2-8  |\n| Eosinophils (%)  | 17.2  | 1-4  |\n| Basophil (%)  | 0.4  | 0.5-1  |\n| Platelets (x10/uL)  | 253  | 150-400  |\n| Prothrombin time (sec)  | 11.2  | 9.7-11.8  |\n| Partial thromboplastin time (sec)  | 27.4  | 24.6-31.2  |\n| INR  | 1.0  | 0.9-1.1  |\n| BUN (mmol/L)  | 12.3  | 3-8  |\n| Creatinine (umol/L)  | 466  | 62-106  |\n| Sodium (mmol/L)  | 139  | 136-145  |\n| Potassium (mmol/L)  | 4.5  | 3.5-5.1  |\n| Bicarbonate (mmol/L)  | 28  | 22-29  |\n| Chloride (mmol/L)  | 102  | 98-107  |\n| Calcium (mmol/L)  | 2.27  | 2.20-2.55  |\n| Phosphate (mmol/L)  | 1.23  | 0.81-1.45  |\n| Uric acid (umol/L)  | 493  | 202-416  |\n| 24-hour urine protein (g)  | 1.1  | <0.15  |\n| Urine red blood cells (/uL)  | 1，824  | 1-9  |\n| Urine white blood cells (/uL)  | 197  | 1-9  |\n| Urine casts  | RBC， WBC， Granular  |  |\n| Urine culture  | Negative  |  |\n| ASO titer (IU/ml)  | 208  | <200  |\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Initial evaluation of this patient was focused on determining the etiology of the visible hematuria and acute kidney inju-ry. Urinary tract infection， coagulopathies， structural lesions of the urinary tract， and nephrolithiasis had already been ex-cluded by initial laboratory tests and radiological imaging of the urinary tract 1 week earlier.\n\n【16】Glomerular diseases such as IgA nephropathy， crescentic glo-merulonephritis， and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis were considered as a cause of macroscopic hematuria and acute kidney injury. Heavy glomerular hematuria in IgA nephropathycan also induce acute kidney injury through oxidative stress and tubulotoxicity. This possibility was also contemplated.On the other hand， absence of edema， normal blood pressure， eo-sinophilia， pyuria， and low-grade proteinuria after recent intake of antibiotics also raised the suspicion of drug-induced TIN. Red blood cell casts， once considered a hallmark of glomeru-lar pathology， have also been described in acute TIN， caused by red blood cell entry into tubular lumens where they admix with Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein . Conversely， macroscopic hematuria is uncommon with the use of modern antibiotics(in contrast to Methicillin-induced TIN， which has long been considered prototypical of drug-induced TIN) . Renal his-topathology not only confirmed TIN but also disclosed a re-markable finding of florid interstitial hemorrhages. Interstitial hemorrhage is usually seen in rather different clinical settings， such as renal infarction， infectious nephritides (eg， Herpes sim-plex virus， Adenovirus， Hantavirus， Rickettsia)， ANCA-relatedvasculitis， trauma， coagulopathies， and in kidney transplant patients， acute cellular/antibody-mediated rejection. It ap-pears that the interstitial inflammation was severe enough to lead to a significant breach in the integrity of the walls of the interstitial blood vessels and tubular basement membranes. This resulted in generous extravasation of red blood cells from the peri-tubular capillaries into the interstitium， causing widespread interstitial hemorrhages. The hemorrhages then extended into the renal tubules， producing visible hematuria and red blood cell casts . Raised interstitial pressure second-ary to the inflammatory process may have facilitated the entry of red blood cells into the tubules through disrupted tubular basement membranes. Interestingly， Ferrari et al described a case of acute interstitial nephritis after Amoxicillin， featuringintratubular red blood cells and red blood cell casts on renal biopsy . By contrast， frank interstitial hemorrhages were not seen. Interstitial hemorrhages have been reported in patients with IgA nephropathy who were concurrently taking oral an-ticoagulants . Direct immunofluorescence studies ruled out IgA nephropathy in our patient. Slightly raised anti-strep-tolysin O antibodies' titer probably indicated previous strep-tococcal infection. However， there was no serological or histo-logical evidence of post-infectious glomerulonephritis： serum complement levels were normal， the glomeruli did not show any proliferative/crescentic change，and immunofluorescence studies precluded immune complex mediated glomerulopa-thies. Ultrastructural examination of glomeruli was desirable to rule out the possibility of co-existing thin basement mem-brane disease or Alport syndrome， but electron microscopy is not available at our institution. Nevertheless， the presence of many red blood cells in renal tubules， but not in the Bowman’s spaces， was suggestive of a \"tubular'rather than ‘glomerular’origin of hematuria.\n\n【17】An important consideration in our patient， excluded by immu-nohistochemical workup， was renal interstitial infiltration by leukemic cells. This has been documented in 83% of autopsy cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia， although interstitial hemorrhages have not been described . Renal interstitial infiltration by leukemic cells can cause acute kidney injury， ei-ther by causing vascular stasis without any structural injury to the nephrons， or by inducing TIN . However， in both these situations， immunohistochemical staining is positive for leukemic cells. BK virus infection has been reported to in-duce hemorrhagic tubulointerstitial nephritis in patients with acute leukemia. This possibility was also excluded by nega-tive SV40 staining.\n\n【18】In summary， antecedent exposure to Amoxicillin-Clavulanate， systemic eosinophilia， abundance of eosinophils and plasmacells in the interstitial infiltrate，and exclusion of other renal pathologies in our patient suggested Amoxicillin-Clavulanate-induced hemorrhagic tubulointerstitial nephritis. The hematuria started within 3 weeks of exposure to Amoxicillin-Clavulanate， which is consistent with the time course of drug-induced TIN. An analysis of more than 150 cases of drug-induced TIN by Rosert et al revealed that renal manifestations developed with-in 3 weeks of starting the inciting drug in about 80% of pa-tients . The etiology is a delayed hypersensitivity immune reaction driven by antigen-reactive T cells； therefore， the re-action is idiosyncratic， not related to the dose of Amoxicillin-Clavulanate or duration of therapy . We believe that glucocorticoids given during the steroid-pre-phase and as a part of induction therapy promoted the resolution of intersti-tial inflammation and recovery of renal function， thereby avoid-ing the need for dialysis. Glucocorticoids are often employed to treat severe interstitial nephritis that persists despite dis-continuation of the inciting agent.\n\n【19】This patient with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia had Amoxicillin-Clavulanate-induced TIN featuring extensive in-terstitial hemorrhages in conjunction with visible hematuria and red blood cell casts. Antibiotic-related TIN should be con-sidered in patients presenting with these features， simulating glomerulonephritis， vasculitis， or infectious interstitial nephri-tis. The key is to follow an open-minded diagnostic approach， moving from a broaderto a narrower differential diagnosis list.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The best measurement of treatment quality in these diseases should be the patient’s opinion of the results using patient-reported outcomes (PRO) instruments. EuroQol 5 Dimensions is increasingly used in spinal research and as an outcome measure in spinal surgery. We assessed the quality of life in patients in the preoperative period and following surgical treatment by using EuroQol 5 Dimensions (EQ5D). Methods： A study of assessment of the quality of life was done in the pre-operative period and post-operatively at the time of discharge， at one month， six months and lyear interval by making use of the EQ-5D in 60 patients of lumbar degenerative spine disease. Results：Most of the patients were in the age group of 58-70 (56.6%)， and there were an almost equal number of males (53.3%)&females (46.7%) in the study. Most of the patients in the study were having preoperative EuroQol 5D values in the range of 0.036-0.156 (55%). Preoperative EuroQol 5D values (mean=0.23) improved at discharge (mean=0.51) and throughout the follow up period at lmonth (mean=0.60)， at 6 months (mean=0.76) and 1 year (mean=0.96). Conclusions： All the patients showed improvement in their assessment scores for Euroqol 5Dimensions throughout the follow-up period and were satisfied with the results. This study also proved that Euroqol 5D is a good tool to assess the quality of life in patients with lumbar degenerative spine disease undergoing surgical treatment. The use of this outcome instrument gives us a platform to predict a positive and accurate outcome after surgery in the long term.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS： Lumbar degenerative spine disease， Quality of life， Euroqol5D， Outcome measure\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】A person's ability or inability to perform activities and tasks of daily living can significantly affect his/her health care outcomes such as physical functioning and health-related quality of life . It is well known that the general population is aging and people are living longer. Rapid demographic changes in the elderly population raise other essential concerns such as healthcare.\n\n【4】The aged people experience at least one episode of low back pain (LBP) or low extremity pain (LEP) in a calendar year . Most of these individuals suffer from compromised quality of life because of frequent episodes of pain.\n\n【5】Degenerative spine disease comprises a group of conditions characterised by loss of normal spinal structure and function， most frequently affecting the lumbar spine . Spinal degen-eration is mainly a consequence of physiologic aging and is a significant cause of chronic disability.\n\n【6】Lumbar degenerative spine disease encompasses lumbar de-generative disc disease (LDDD)， spinal stenosis， degenerative spondylolisthesis， degeneration of facet joints and degenerative scoliosis . Persons affected by lumbar degenerative spine con-ditions are at risk for physical functioning limitations， disability and possible neurologic deficit  .\n\n【7】The comparative results of patients treated with surgery and conservatively treated patients have revealed that surgical treat-ment is much better at short-term follow-up (up to 1 year). How-ever， no variations have been observed among treatments at long-term follow-upJ.\n\n【8】Despite significant technical successes of the different opera-tive procedures for various disorders， it is established that some patients operated for spine disease are still left with poor results71.\n\n【9】The definition of a good surgical outcome depends on how success is assessed . In the past， outcomes were commonly as-sessed based on surgeon's subjective views， and the results were ranked using terms such as \"excellent\"，“good\"，\"moderate\" and“bad\".\n\n【10】However， the surgeon's perspectives and results of imaging studies frequently do not correlate with patient satisfaction . Poor treatment outcomes in persons with lumbar degenerative spine conditions canlead to chronic pain and long term disability and affect health-related quality of life.\n\n【11】In this sense， the best measurement of treatment quality should be the patient's opinion of the results using patient-reported outcomes (PRO) instruments. Outcome-based on pa-tient's satisfaction with treatment and health-related quality of life after surgery has gained increasing interest in recent years. PRO instruments provide results as numerical scores. Pre &postoperative scores can be compared to detect changes.\n\n【12】The patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) provide a powerful， quantifiable and standardised research tool against which the effectiveness of healthcare interventions can be judged. In recent decades， several questionnaires have been de-veloped and validated for the clinical and functional evaluation of spinal treatment outcomes.\n\n【13】These instruments， in addition to assessing outcomes from patient's perspectives， can be used to select patients for whom surgery is appropriate， as preoperative values often correlate with the success of treatment .\n\n【14】In the measurement of patient-based outcomes， the patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) used should ideally be based on good quality criteria.\n\n【15】These criteria include content validity， internal consistency， criterion validity， construct validity， reproducibility (agreement and reliability)， responsiveness， floor and ceiling effects and interpretability .\n\n【16】Recently， the consensus was reached within the International Consortium for Health Outcomes (ICHOM) collaboration on which PROMs should be recommended for the evaluation of outcomes of interventions for degenerative lumbar spinal dis-orders (Oswestry Disability Index \\[ODI\\]， Numeric Pain Rating Scale \\[NPRS\\] and EuroQol 5 Dimensions \\[EQ5D\\]).\n\n【17】EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D)： It helps us in measuring health-related quality of life. EQ-5D is increas-ingly used in spinal research and as an outcome measure in spinal surgery. The instrument contains five-point Likert-type items (no/slight/moderate/severe/extreme)， which describe five dimensions of a respondent’s health status on the day of the survey， i.e.， mobility， self-care， usual activities，pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression\n\n【18】We did a prospective study for quality of life assessment in lumbar degenerative spine disease patients in the preoperative period and following surgical treatment by using the EuroQol 5Dimensions.\n\n【19】Methods\n\n【20】This study was carried out in the Department of Neurosurgery at Fortis Hospital， Noida. Sixty patients were studied. Follow up was done at the time of discharge， at one month， at six months and one-year interval after surgery.\n\n【21】Inclusion criteria\n\n【22】Patients of Lumbar degenerative spine disease having symptoms of low back pain， neurogenic claudication， difficulty in walking not responding to conservative treatment and willing to undergo surgical treatment. Patient aged more than 45 years.\n\n【23】Exclusion criteria\n\n【24】Patients are having spine pathology due to infection， malignancy or trauma.\n\n【25】Patients undergoing repeat surgery for lumbar degenerative spine disease.\n\n【26】Patients with other significant neurologic comorbidities such as Parkinson's disease， amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or multiple sclerosis.\n\n【27】Methodology：\n\n【28】Patients having symptoms of lumbar degenerative spine disease were admitted in the Neurosurgery Department. A detailed history and clinical examination were made and diagnosis of lumbar degenerative spine disease by various radiological tests like X-ray， MRI and CT scan if required was done. After doing routine and specific investigations and after taking informed consent， patients were posted for surgery.\n\n【29】The assessment of the quality of life was done in the pre-operative period and post-operatively at the time of discharge， at one month， six months and 1year interval by making use of the EQ-5D and calculating the index scores.\n\n【30】Questionnaires were asked on the following parameters of EQ-5D：(i) Mobility：\n\n【31】1\\. I have no problems walking about\n\n【32】2\\. I have slight problems in walking about\n\n【33】3\\. I have moderate problems in walking about\n\n【34】4\\. I have severe problems in walking about\n\n【35】5\\. I am unable to walk about\n\n【36】(ii) Self-care：\n\n【37】1\\. I have no problems washing or dressing myself\n\n【38】3\\. I have moderate problems washing or dressing myself\n\n【39】4\\. I have severe problems washing or dressing myself\n\n【40】5\\. I am unable to wash or dress myself\n\n【41】(iii) Usual activities： (e.g. work， study， housework， family or leisure activities)：\n\n【42】1\\. I have no problems doing my usual activities\n\n【43】2\\. I have slight problems doing my usual activities\n\n【44】3\\. I have moderate problems doing my usual activities\n\n【45】4\\. I have severe problems doing my usual activities\n\n【46】5\\. I am unable to do my usual activities\n\n【47】(iv) Pain / Discomfort：\n\n【48】1\\. I have no pain or discomfort\n\n【49】2\\. I have slight pain or discomfort\n\n【50】3\\. I have moderate pain or discomfort\n\n【51】4\\. I have severe pain or discomfort\n\n【52】5\\. I have extreme pain or discomfort\n\n【53】(v) Anxiety / Depression：\n\n【54】1\\. I am not anxious or depressed\n\n【55】2\\. I am slightly anxious or depressed\n\n【56】3\\. I am moderately anxious or depressed\n\n【57】4\\. I am severely anxious or depressed\n\n【58】5\\. I am extremely anxious or depressed\n\n【59】An individual's response to the five items jointly forms a multi-attribute health state for which a utility value (i.e.， the EQ-5D-5L index score) is assigned to indicate the utility of the health state to the general public. The index score is anchored by 0 (death) and 1(full health)， with a higher score indicating higher utility.\n\n【60】Statistical Evaluation\n\n【61】Descriptive analysis was carried out. Parametric data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Paired t' test was performed to find out the differences in the variables between pre-operative and post-operative stages among the study popu-lation. Statistical significance was assumed at a value of P <0.05. Findings were statistically analyzed by using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software for windows.\n\n【62】Results\n\n【63】In our study， most of the patients were in the age group of 58-70(56.6%)， and total males patients in the study were 32(53.3%)&total females patients in the study were 28(46.7%). Most of the patients (58.3%) have a duration of symptoms between 1-5 years.\n\n【64】Most of the patients were having preoperative EuroQol 5D index score in the range of 0.036-0.156 (55%). \n\n【65】On comparison of preoperative Euorgol 5D index scores with postoperative assessment scores at discharge， one month， six months & 1 year， there was a statistically significant improve-ment in the postoperative Euoroqol 5D scores as compared to the preoperative values. \n\n【66】Discussion\n\n【67】Degenerative spine disease comprises a group of conditions characterised by loss of normal spinal structure and function， most frequently affecting the lumbar spine. Persons affected by lumbar degenerative spine conditions are at risk for physi-cal functioning limitations， disability and possible neurologic deficit.\n\n【68】We assessed the quality of life in patients in the preoperative period and following surgical treatment by using EuroQol 5Dimensions (EQ5D).\n\n【69】The mean age was 59 years in our study. Jansson KA et al. noted that the mean age of patients was 66 years in their study. With an increase in the number of the elderly population， it is expected that there will be an increased incidence of patients with degenerative spine disease .\n\n【70】Hence， it is essential to know whether surgical treatment is as useful for older adults as for younger. In our study， there was no statistically significant effect of age on the outcome fol-lowing surgery. Some studies have found that increasing age is associated with less favourable outcome .\n\n【71】Other studies have found that increasing age did not affect the outcome (Sigmundsson et al. and Arinzon et al.) . In our study， there was no statistically significant effect of gender on the outcome following surgery. These findings are following the findings of Thornes E et al.， 2011.\n\n【72】Sigmundsson et al. in their study of 109 patients with central spinal stenosis also found that there were no statistically sig nificant differences in outcome parameters between males and females .However several studies have shown that female gender has less satisfaction with the procedure  .\n\n【73】Total males in the study were 32(53.3%) & total females in the study were 28(46.7%). In a study of 109 patients with central spinal stenosis in the Swedish Spine Register by Sigmundsson et al.， there were 56(51.3%) males & 53(48.6%) females .\n\n【74】In our study， 58.3% of patients have duration of symptoms between 1-5 years， indicating the chronic nature of the lumbar degenerative spine conditions.\n\n【75】There was no statistically significant effect of duration of symptoms on outcome in our analysis. Amundsen T et al.  also did not find that duration of symptoms had any influence on outcome after a 10-year follow-up . Two meta-analyses ex-ploring prognostic factors in spinal stenosis surgery also found that duration of symptoms was not a significant factor influ-encing the outcome \n\n【76】Table 1 Duration of symptoms.\n\n| Duration of symptoms  | No of cases  | Percentage (%)  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| <1year  | 17  | 28.3  |\n| 1-5years  | 35  | 58.3  |\n| \\>5 years  | 8  | 13.3  |\n\n【78】Table 2 Comparison of preoperative Euorqol 5D index scores with postoperative scoresfollow up in our study was 0.96 (SD=0.074) and the difference on comparing with the preoperative value was found to be sta-tistically significant (p <0.001).

So， quality of life was hampered in most of the patients at presentation. Mean EuroQol 5D value in the preoperative assessment in our study was 0.23 (SD=0.186).\n\n【82】Solberg T et al. in a prospective study of 326 patients who underwent lumbar spine surgery for degenerative disorders， found that mean EuroQol 5D value was 0.26 in the preoperative period . Robinson Y et al. found that mean EuroQol 5D value was 0.31 in the preoperative period in their study .\n\n【83】Sigmundsson et al. in their study of 109 patients with central spinal stenosis found that mean EuroQol 5D value was 0.41 in the preoperative period .\n\n【84】Mean EuroQol 5D value at the time of discharge in our study was 0.51 (SD =0.042). Comparing preoperative EuroQol 5D value in our study with postoperative follow up the value at discharge， the difference was found to be statistically significant(p<0.001).\n\n【85】Mean postoperative EuroQol 5D value at the time of one month follow up in our study was 0.60 (SD =0.092) and the difference on comparing with the preoperative value was found to be statistically significant (p<0.001).\n\n【86】Mean postoperative EuroQol 5D value at the time of six months follow up in our study was 0.76 (SD=0.157)， and the difference on comparing with the preoperative value was found to be statistically significant (p <0.001).\n\n【87】Mean postoperative EuroQol 5D value at the time of one year\n\n【88】In a study by Jansson KA et al.， they found that the mean EQ-5D value improved from 0.36 to 0.64， and the quality of life improved in 184 (80%) of the patients . Robinson Y et al. also noted that mean EQ-5D values improved in the follow-up period.\n\n【89】In the study of 109 patients with central spinal stenosis by Sigmundsson et al.， the mean EuroQol 5D value improved from0.41 in the preoperative period to 0.60 at one year follow up . Our findings are also following prospective study of 326 patients who underwent lumbar spine surgery for degenerative disorders by Solberg T et al. in which they described the criteria for success for EQ-5D score by defining the optimal cut off point， and they found that the cutoff value for success for the mean change score was 0.30 . Werner DAT et al. did a study intending to identify dichotomous cut-offs for failure and worsening. They described\"Failure\" after 12 months for EQ-5D score， as an insufficient improvement from baseline， with EQ-5D final raw score <0.63. In our study， mean EuroQol 5D value was 0.96 at one year follow up， hence there was no\"Failure\".\n\n【90】In this study， we found that there was a large improvement in symptoms， several aspects of quality of life. This indicates the multiple benefits of surgical intervention in patients suffering from lumbar degenerative spine disease.\n\n【91】This study was conducted on 60 patients with lumbar degen-erative spine disease undergoing surgical treatment at Fortis Hospital， Noida from June 2016， to assess the efficacy of Euro-Qol 5D as a patient-reported outcome instrument.\n\n【92】Preoperative EuroQol 5D values (mean=0.23) improved at discharge (mean=0.51) and throughout the follow up period at 1month (mean=0.60)， at 6 months (mean=0.76) and 1 year(mean=0.96). So， all the patients showed improvement in their assessment scores for Euroqol 5Dimensions throughout the follow-up period and were satisfied with the results.\n\n【93】This study also proved that Euroqol 5D is a good tool to assess the quality of life in patients with lumbar degenerative spine disease undergoing surgical treatment.\n\n【94】The use of this outcome instrument gives us a platform to predict a positive and accurate outcome after surgery in the long term. The results obtained after using this outcome instrument will be useful as more accurate information could be provided to the patients in future.\n\n【95】Additionally， understanding one's results objectively em-power a provider to continuously learn from and refine the care he or she delivers.\n\n【96】On a broad scale， outcome reporting also facilitates the dis-semination of best practices between physicians and makes it possible to compare the quality delivered by different providers. This indicator could also be used by the surgeon to self-audit his work. The results of this study can be used for planning further research in this area.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

A 7-month-old male infant with previously normal developmental milestones started with symptoms of fever， torpor and persistent metabolic acidosis during the course of a respiratory infection. The condition progressed to acute deterioration and cardiac arrest. After cardiorespiratory resuscitation， he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. He presented with seizure， coma， metabolic acidosis and disturbed of hydroelectrolytic and glycemic imbalance. A head CT scan showed hypodensity in basal ganglia， thalamus， dentate nuclei and mesencephalon. The diagnosis was established through the dosage of organics acids in the urine that showed increased excretion of 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyric acid. Laboratory tests， neuroimage aspects， history of parents consanguinity， report of the death of other probands and clinical evolution of the patient led to the suspicion of an inborn error of metabolism.\n\n【1】Case report\n\n【2】We describe a male， 7-month-old，born at Pecanha， Minas Gerais， Brazil， previously healthy and with normal developmental mile-stones to his age. He was admitted at the hospital in his home-town with symptoms of irritability， somnolence and fever. He received a diagnosis and treatment for severe Pneumonia associ-ated with severe dehydration and peripheral cyanosis. At this occasion，he was treated with Oxacillin and Ceftriaxone due to a clinical and laboratory presentation suggestive of bacterial infec-tion without signs of involvement of the central nervous system. He was readmitted at the emergency room around 24 hours after discharge with somnolence， poor suction， vomiting and respira-tory distress. His condition suddenly deteriorated with cardiac arrest， so he required orotracheal intubation. Also， insulin wasinitiated due to hyperglycemia. He was transferred to the Inten-sive Care Unit of the Hospital Infantil Toao Paulo II at Belo Hori-zonte， Minas Gerais. He was comatose in mechanical ventilation and with continuous intravenous sedation. Presented hyper-glycemia， metabolic acidosis， hypernatremia，hyperchloremia， hypercalcemia and hypocalcemia and presented an episode of tonic-clonic generalised seizure. Treatment was performed for hydroelectrolytic disturbance， and Phenobarbital was initiated due to seizures. The patient did not present seizures recurrence after the introduction of this drug. He also presented episodes of dysautonomia， characterized by sudoresis， tachycardia and arterial hypertension， which improved after the introduction of Clonidine and Propranolol. A head CT scan was performed and showed hypodensity at basal ganglia， thalamus， dentate nuclei and mesencephalon. (Picture 1).\n\n【3】By the family history， parents informed consanguinity(cousins at 2nd degree) and that the first child of the couple was dead nine-months-old with a similar health condition to the patient. They also related numerous deaths at the family during the first year of life of unknown cause. In the face of the clinical presentation and findings of neuroimage， exams were collected to investigate inborn errors of metabolism. It was also initiated empiric treatment with vitamins Levocarnitine， folinicacid， pyridoxine， riboflavin， biotin， thiamine， Q10 coenzyme and administration of hypoproteic diet.\n\n【4】The patient evolved with clinical stability with the treat-ment. After the suspension of the continuous sedation he pre-sented a mild improvement at the conscious level but kept poor spontaneous movements； he lost the ability of visual follow-ing， and also presented dystonia of the superior limbs and fa-cial hypomimia. The urinary organic acids analysis showed high levels of tyglylglycline and 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl which brought the hypothesis of Ketothiolase deficiency and2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. It was requested then a new urine sample that confirmed the 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. At the present case， it was not possible to verify the presence of the specific genetic mutation due to the unavailability of this test at our service.\n\n【5】During his hospitalization it was possible to take the patient out of mechanical ventilation despite discrete chronic retention of CO2 and tracheostomy. He persisted with dystonia in supe-rior limbs， severe neuropsychomotor impairment and degluti-tion disorder， which lead to a gastrostomy. He also kept the autonomic dysfunction despite adequate treatment.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】The inborn errors of metabolism are singular genetic disorders characterized by biochemical defects. Individually they are con-sidered rare， but in the group， they become pathologies of sig-nificant meaning responsible for deaths and morbidity. They can have an autosomal recessive character， autosomal dominant or X-linked patterns and the signs and symptoms are a conse-quence of the cumulative effect of toxic substrates， deficiency or both of them. \n\n【8】The 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase defi-ciency also denoted 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type10 (HSD10) deficiency  is a rare inborn error of metabolism of isoleucine and branched-chain fatty acids as first described at 2000 by Zschocke et al. It is a mitochondrial enzyme capable of metabolism of 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA to2-methyl-acetoacetyl-CoA (picture 2). As a result of the enzy-matic defect， the patient commonly presents a normal neuropsy-chomotor development in the first months of life followed by regression of previously acquired abilities， associated with hy potonia， seizures and motor disorders. It usually starts after a stressor event.\n\n【9】Men with this diagnosis have low levels of the enzyme， and in the first year of life shows a delay in the neuropsychomotor development associated to metabolic acidosis. After the sixth month of age， clinical deterioration begins with the loss of psy-chomotor skills and progressive neurological disorders such as visual loss， epilepsy，dystonia and spasticity. The development of cardiomyopathy is common. However， women with this de-ficiency may be asymptomatic or manifest mild neurological conditions such as the cognitive deficit， for example， depending on the hepatic inactivation pattern of X. \n\n【10】Diagnosis is based on the clinical suspicion of organic aciduria associated with organic acids urinary dosage which reveals increased excretion of tyglylglycline and 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl without an equal increase of 2-methyl-acetoacetyl. Usually， acylcarnitines profile shows normal results. The neuroimaging findings reported in patients with MHBD deficiency are heterogeneous and include frontotemporal or frontoparietal cortical atrophy， occipital periventricular white\n\n【11】Isoleucine 2-Methylated fatty acids\n\n【12】matter lesion， severe cerebral atrophy and occipital infarction-like images and frontotemporal atrophy with bilateral signal abnormalities in the putamen . The primary differential diag-noses are respiratory chain defects and ketothiolase deficiency. Molecular studies may identify the mutant variant and help with familial genetic counselling. The disease presents a pattern of re-cessive inheritance X-linked， and the involved gene is HSD17B10placed at Xp11.2 chromosome. In comparison to other inborn metabolic disorders involved at isoleucine metabolism2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency patients do not have any benefits of amino acid restriction diet. As in other organic acidurias， the patient can benefit from hypopro-teic diet and vitamin supplements， like L-carnitine. It has been observed that male patients described in the medical literature until now have a bad prognosis with progression to a neurode-generative state and myocardiopathy . There is no curative treatment yet， and management is palliative.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】The 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl CoA deficiency is a rare disease， X-linked， associated with failure at isoleucine metabolism in which symptoms begin during the first years of life. There are still only 30 case reports described at literature worldwide since the first in 2000. There is no specific treatment but it is usually adopted supportive care similar to other organic acidurias like hypoproteic diet and vitamin supplement. In the other hand， clinical suspicion and early diagnosis are fundamental to im-prove survival and genetic counseling.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The other arm of the suture was then passed through the corneal incision， posterior to the iris and capsular bag，up through the capsular bag medial to the inferior haptic， and was exited from beneath the scleral flap . A Sinskey hook was used to adjust the sutures loop around the inferior haptic through the paracentesis site. The knot underneath the scleral flap was then tied . The scleral flap was closed with 10-0 nylon suture. Conjunctiva was sutured with 8.0 vicril suture.

Faced with a wide variety of presenting symptoms， they propose a diagnostic dilemma and lack of a definite preoperative diagnosis may result in inadequate pre-operative preparation with disastrous consequences. We present a case of urinary bladder paraganglioma wherein we could achieve definite diagnosis after a cystoscopy guided biopsy of the lesion. This enabled us to prepare the patient for a laparoscopic partial cystectomy adequately. The patient was discharged after an uneventful postoperative course.\n\n【1】Introduction\n\n【2】Paragangliomas or extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas arise from chromaffin tissue of the sympathetic nervous system in locations outside the adrenal gland. Paragangliomas of the uri-nary bladder account for only 6% of all extra-adrenal pheochro-mocytomas.  When asymptomatic， these tumours present a diagnostic challenge and lack of a definitive preoperative di-agnosis may result in insufficient preparation， leading to an unexpected intra-operative hypertensive crisis. Here we present a 55-vear-old female who presented with non-specific urinary complaints. The patient was diagnosed with a non-secretory bladder paraganglioma for which we successfully performed a laparoscopic partial cystectomy.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 55-year-old lady complaining of dysuria and lower abdom-inal pain for two months was admitted to our hospital. She had an unremarkable family history and no previous medical problems. Her vitals were stable； she was soft per abdomen and had no hematuria. Routine blood and urine tests were nor-mal. Ultrasonography (US) of the urinary bladder showed asmall hypoechogenic mass from the anterior wall. A computed tomography (CT) confirmed a rounded mass lesion 2.9x2.9x2.5 cm without any metastatic disease. Our patient underwent cystoscopy and biopsy of the lesion. On histopathological exam-ination (HPE) the cells with vesicular nuclei were arranged in sheets and were strongly positive for chromogranin and synap-tophysin on immunohistochemistry (IHC)， confirming a urinary bladder paraganglioma.  She was posted for a la-paroscopy partial cystectomy with wide local excision of the tumor.  The tumor involved the inner half of the mus-cularis mucosa， and the surgical margins were free of the tumor on pathological evaluation.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Bladder paraganglioma is a rare entity with a female pre-ponderance (3：1) during the second to fourth decade of life.1Catecholamine secreting paragangliomas may mimic a hyper-functioning adrenal pheochromocytoma. Their position within the bladder results in a characteristic symptom complex of headache， dizziness， sweating and palpitation after micturition or overdistension of the bladder. Systemic catecholamine re-lease which occurs due to the increased pressure secondary to bladder contraction may explain these sympathomimetic attacks.Non-functional tumours may be asymptomatic， making them a diagnostic challenge. So， when a paraganglioma of the blad-der is suspected， catecholamine level and its metabolites such as metanephrine and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) secretion in either the blood or urine is measured. In a non-functional tumour， the levels of these metabolites may be normal. Since our patient was asymptomatic， the authors felt these laboratory investigations to be costly and unnecessary.\n\n【7】US， CT or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may help lo-calise the tumour. In contrast to an adrenal pheochromocytoma，bladder paragangliomas are likely to be homogenous on a T2weighted MRI signal. I131-methyliodobenzylguanidine (I131-MIBG) and positron emission tomography (PET)-CT help to evaluate the functional status of the disease and look for distant metastasis.  The role of cystoscopy and biopsy is controversial for the fear that it may provoke a hypertensive crisis. However， in centres without nuclear imaging access， cystoscopy after ade-quate hydration and alpha neurogenic blockade may be required to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【8】The tumour is well circumscribed and turns black when placed in a Zenker's fixative， indicating a positive chromaffin reaction. On HPE， paraganglioma cells are arranged in a Zell-ballen pattern and are surrounded by a fibrous network rich in blood vessels . On IHC analysis， the chief cells are positive for neuroendocrine markers like chromogranin， and synaptophysin and the sustentacular cells are negative for cy-tokeratin， which differentiates it from urothelial carcinomas.  Metastasis to distant organs remains the only widely accepted proof of malignancy.\n\n【9】Treatment modalities include a transurethral resection， a par-tial or total cystectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection in the presence of proven metastasis.  Since a hypertensive crisis may be precipitated during surgery； appropriate preopera-tive preparation is of paramount importance. An a-adrenergic blockade should be ensured before the B-adrenergic blockade， to prevent the risk of unopposed adrenergic stimulation. A lib-eral salt diet and adequate hydration are advised to expand the contracted blood volume.\n\n【10】In our case， the large size of the tumour prompted us to perform a laparoscopic partial cystectomy. There were no fluctu-ations in the intra-operative blood pressure， and the resection margins were tumour free. The urinary bladder was closed in two layers， and the patient was discharged after an uneventful postoperative course.\n\n【11】Conclusion\n\n【12】Urinary bladder paragangliomas are a rare entity which may pose a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge when the classical signs of a sympathomimetic attack are absent. Awareness of this entity amongst the urologists and pathologists is of paramount importance， to ensure adequate preoperative correction of the catecholamine excess and prevent surgical misadventures.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

At this stage of the disease， he was proposed for palliativeradiotherapy. Considered an oncological emergency requiring immedi-ate radiotherapy in most cases， the treatment of malignant SVCS focuses on relieving symptoms and treating the underlying disease with other therapeutic alternatives in addition to radiotherapy. This case intends to focus on its diagnosis and illustrate an unusual presentation with a massive bilateral extension.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Approximately 50-60 cases of SGS have been recorded in the literature worldwide since its discovery in 1982. This collagen disorder affects bone and vascular development throughout the body， resulting in craniosynostosis， scoliosis， chest deformities， and aortic root dilation. Patients may have problems in the central nervous system， including Chiari 1 malformation， hydrocephalus， and dilation of the lateral ven-tricles. Unfortunately， the symptoms of SGS closely parallel those of related collagenopathies involving muta-tions in the TGF-B signaling pathway， which makes accurate diagnosis difficult without genetic testing， espe-cially in cases with complex presentation.\n\n【2】Case Report： In this report we present the unique and complex disease manifestations in a 9-year-old girl with SGS. The pa-tient had severe cervical spinal instability that resolved after surgical occipital-C4 fusion with an autograft from the rib. Midface distraction surgery was used to treat the patient's craniosynostosis and related facia deformities. This surgery was complicated by loss of 750 mL of blood due to insufficient dura and prominent vasculature.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】Connective tissue symptoms associated with SGS can involve dural and vascular problems， as seen in this case report. Thus， the risk of extreme blood loss should be anticipated any time midface distraction surgery is per-formed on an SGS patient. Continued research is needed to define how this case relates to the SGS patient population.\n\n【5】MeSH Keywords： Craniosynostosis· DiGeorge Syndrome·Dura Mater ·Osteogenesis， Distraction·\n\n【6】Spinal Cord Compression\n\n【7】Abbreviations： SGS - Shprintzen-Goldberg Syndrome； LDS - Loeys-Dietz Syndrome； MRI- magnetic resonance imaging； CT scan - computerized axial tomography scan； CSF - cerebrospinal fluidShprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (OMIM #182212) is an ultra-rare autosomal-dominant genetic collagenopathy. Common characteristics include marfanoid body habitus， characteris tic craniofacial abnormalities， craniosynostosis， severe scoli-osis， rib abnormalities， intellectual disability， abdominal and umbilical hernias， and aortic dilation. SGS is molecularly het-erogeneous， with mutations most often found in the R-SMAD binding region of exon 1 of the SKI (Sloan-Kettering Institute) gene. Mutations in this gene result in an overactive SMAD-dependent pathway of TGF-B signaling.\n\n【8】The proto-oncoprotein SKI normally inhibits SMAD proteins by preventing them from entering the nucleus to transcribe the TGF-B gene. The TGF-B pathway is essential for cell growth， proliferation， and programmed cell death. Its dysregulation re-sults in many of the cardiovascular and connective tissue de-formities seen in SGS . Less frequently， SGS patients have mutations in the fibrillin 1 (FBN1) gene， which also codes for a TGF-B regulatory protein. Mutations in other proteins on this pathway can also result in excess activity， leading to similar phenotypic presentations as seen in Marfan and Loeys-Dietz syndromes . There is often an extensive delay preceding SGS diagnosis because it is extremely difficult to distinguish between these related collagenopathies. Delay of diagnosis in SGS can have fatal consequences， as will be discussed later in this report.\n\n【9】Fortunately， the differential expressions of various proteins in the TGF-B pathway lead to slight differences between re-lated collagenopathies. For example， aortic abnormalities are usually milder in SGS than in Loeys-Dietz syndrome because the SKl gene is expressed less pervasively in the aorta than are TGF-B receptor genes. Moreover， intellectual disability appears in SGS patients more often than in Loeys-Dietz pa-tients . The present patient's unique presentation of SGS most notably involves severe cervical spinal cord compres-sion， abnormal facial vasculature， and insufficient dura mater.\n\n【10】The dura mater is the outermost layer of the meninges， which provides a protective covering for the brain and spinal cord. The dura mater forms a barrier between cerebrospinal fluid and blood. Thus， cerebrospinal fluid will leak if the dura is compromised. Cerebrospinal fluid leakage is a major neu-rosurgical complication that can result in pneumocephalus， meningitis， improper wound healing， and infections of the graft-bone or epidural space . Our patient presented with insufficient dura， resulting in CSF leakage during a combina-tion Monobloc advancement and cranial vault remodeling sur-gery aimed to treat midface hypoplasia. Midface hypoplasia is common among SGS patients and can result in lagophthal-mos， obstruction of the upper airway， and obstructive sleepapnea . Midface hypoplasia and its resultant problems are often addressed in SGS patients with surgical treatment in-volving opening of the skull. However， such surgeries are ex-tremely risky in patients with collagen disorders affecting the dura and surrounding vascularity. Thus， the prevalent connec tive tissue problems must be assessed prior to surgical inter-vention in SGS patients.\n\n【11】Case Report\n\n【12】This patient was a full-term baby， birth weight 8 pounds 11ounces， born to a G5P5 35-year-old mother. The pregnancy was complicated by spotting at 7 weeks， difficulty picking up heart-beat at 19 weeks， and a 2-vessel umbilical cord. Although the vaginal delivery was relatively easy， the baby had a fractured clavicle at birth. The patient’s dysmorphic facial features in-cluded frontal bossing， low-set ears， hairy ear lobes， and facial features resembling trisomy 21. The patient displayed moder-ate hypotonia， loose hips， and significant head lag. These con-cerns led to immediate transfer from the birthing center to the local hospital and subsequent transfer via life-flight to the re-gional hospital. Karyotype was normal (46XX) and Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays were negative for all triso-mies. Upon discharge， the patient had difficulties feeding and gaining weight， resulting in 3 hospitalizations for failure to thrive during the first year. Facial deformities and hypotonia contributed to her inability to innervate muscles needed for eating and swallowing. After supplementary high-calorie for-mula and breastfeeding showed limited success， a gastrosto-my tube (G-tube) was placed at 4 months. Adequate caloric intake and expected growth for age were attained. G-tube feedings continue to be the primary form of nutrition to date.\n\n【13】Many of the patient’s symptoms corresponded with collagen-related disorders. Observed bony abnormalities included cervi-cal spinal instability， 13 pairs of ribs， recurrent left knee sublux-ation， coxa valga， contractures， joint hyperflexibility， and focal reversal of lordosis at T12-L1. Finger abnormalities included camptodactyly， clinodactyly， hypoplastic thumbs， and arachno-dactyly. This patient exhibited an asymmetric chest deformity involving both the pectus excavatum and carinatum. Notable craniofacial abnormalities included craniosynostosis， midface hypoplasia， exophthalmos， hypertelorism， ptosis， lagophthalmos， low-set ears， retrognathia， and a high narrow palate. At 2 years， the patient was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea and prescribed continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)， which improved energy and progress with developmental milestones.\n\n【14】This patient was tested for Loeys-Dietz syndrome， otopalat-odigital syndrome， Sticklers syndrome， Zellweger syndrome， Marshall-Smith syndrome， and Marshall syndrome prior to\n\n【15】Craniofacial abnormalities：\n\n| Craniofacial abnormalities：  |\n| --- |\n| · craniosynostosis with copper beaten appearance  |\n| · flat facial features， midface hypoplasia  |\n| ·oblong， square facial shape  |\n| · mildly abnormal calvarial (skull) shape w/mild  |\n| brachycephaly (short skull)  |\n| ·frontal bossing/turribrachycephaly/prominent forehead  |\n| ·large fontanel as an infant  |\n| · short and upturned nose with depressed nasal bridge/  |\n| malar flattening  |\n| ·long philtrum  |\n| · superiorly over-folded/floppy right ear w/crumpled helix  |\n| · soft ears with thin cartilage  |\n| ·low set ears  |\n| · soft high narrow palate with extra rugae (ridges)  |\n| · broad， long， and bifid uvula  |\n| · bilateral torus palatini  |\n| · retrognathia/mandibular hypoplasia (class IlI malocclusion)  |\n| · underdeveloped supraorbital ridges  |\n| ·hypertelorism/telecanthus (widely spaced eyes)  |\n| Orthopedic/skeletal abnormalities：  |\n| · severe cervical spinal stenosis  |\n| · dural ectasia w/Tarlov cysts/syringomyelia  |\n| · focal reversal of lordosis at T12-L1/transitional  |\n| thoracolumbar anatomy/kyphosis  |\n| ·low bone mineral density  |\n| · asymmetric pectus deformity (excavatum and carinatum)  |\n| · pes planus (flat feet)  |\n| · arachnodactyly (long， slender fingers)  |\n| ·camptodactyly (bent fingers)  |\n| · clinodactyly of little fingers  |\n| ·hypoplastic digits of hands treated w/safe position thumb  |\n| spica splints  |\n| joint contractures  |\n| joint hyperflexibility/hypermobility  |\n| ·j  |\n| ·joint dislocation and instability (left patella， thumb， foot，  |\n| and C1-C2 spine)  |\n| · bone fracture of right collarbone   |\n| · thin ribs， 13 ribs  |\n| · unusual iliac horns (hip joints)， coxa valga  |\n\n【17】diagnosis. Finally， a genetic test at age 4 years revealed a c.104C>A transversion mutation in exon one of the SKl gene， which converts a proline to a glutamine. This mutation causes SGS. Through genetic consult， an official SGS diagnosis was made 2 months later.\n\n【18】Doctors conducted risk assessment tests upon diagnosis， includ-ing echocardiogram of heart and imaging of the cervical spinal cord. Imaging of this patient's cervical spine revealed severe stenosis and radiographic evidence of myelomalacia at the cra-niocervical junction . This prompted surgical decom-pression of the foramen magnum and an occipital-cervical fu-sion. Postoperative ly， her strength markedly improved and she became ambulatory.

Losartan was prescribed at age 6 years to prevent further dilation.\n\n【63】The patient's craniosynostosis involved midface hypoplasia， a symptom in which the middle of the face is not fully developed. This was treated at age 5 years with a com-bination Monobloc osteotomy and LeFort IlI distraction sur-gery. Table 2 provides a full description of the preoperative CT scan and surgical procedure. During the surgery， the surgeonsdiscovered dura that was \"less than toilet paper thin\"adjacent to the sinus bilaterally and nonexistent over multiple brain sec-tions， including about 4 cm of the sagittal sinus. The dura was also not sticking to the skull. This was not identified on thepreoperative CT scan. DuraGen was applied to partially seal the dura. In spite of this insufficiency， there was enough dura at the skull base for removal for subsequent anterior vault re-construction. The patient experienced a surgical blood loss ofapproximately 750 ml requiring a total of 17 blood transfu-sions. Blood flow was stopped with light pressure and appli-cation of Tisseel sealant. The surgeons also noted very thin periorbital tissue with pervasive fat herniation and a thin peri-osteal flap manifesting in adjacent connective tissue problems.\n\n【64】Table 2.

The patient was discharged after 7 days， without complications. Distractors were advanced 1 mm per day for 3 weeks and removed after 9 weeks . This surgery normalized the midface-to-jaw relationship， improved exophthalmos and hypertelorism， and slightly im-proved sleep apnea.\n\n【67】Discussion\n\n【68】This case relates to many other SGS cases presented in the lit-erature， and the present report improves understanding of this disease. A comprehensive summary of SGS cases is shown in Tables 3-5. Notably， this patient's scoliosis was mild relative to other patients in the literature. This patient's focal rever-sal of lordosis at T12-L1 does not currently require surgery. A previous report presented 4 SGS patients requiring surgical scoliosis repair . These surgeries involved numerous bone density-related complications during the operation and in the years following the procedure. Our patients cardiac symptoms were also milder than some of those seen in the literature. In contrast， SGS patients may display severe aortic dilation re-sulting in aneurysm . Moreover， 1 patient required mitral valve replacement to treat severe regurgitation. Our patient presented with mild aortic root dilation and mitral valve re-gurgitation， suggesting that the cardiac symptoms were rela tively mild. Our patient presented with a c.104C>A in exon 1of the SKl gene， which is considered the genetic hotspot for SGS mutations.\n\n【69】Our patient's combination Monobloc osteotomy and LeFort ⅢII distraction surgery has not been previously recorded anywhere in the literature， as they are rarely performed concurrently. The procedural method for Monobloc osteotomy is described in Dr. Laure’s 2014 surgical case study ， while the proce-dure for LeFort III distraction id presented in lanetti et al's 2012meta-analysis on this procedure . Any midface distraction surgery comes with a high risk of blood loss. However， our pa-tient's extreme intraoperative blood loss of 750 mL had syn-dromic causes. The patient had significant holes and paucity in the dura mater that were not observable on preoperative CT scans and could not be completely sealed using DuraGen. This represents an unprecedented symptom of SGS.\n\n【70】Our patient's insufficient dura mater is likely syndromic. Collagen disorders，including SGS， may affect all connective tis-sues， including the dura mater. Furthermore， dural issues have been identified in other heritable connective tissue disorders. In a study by Dr. E. Reinstein， 9 patients with hereditary con-nective tissue disorders experienced CSF leakage due to dural fragility， 7 of whom had Ehlers-Danlos or Marfan syndromes. All these cases resolved with epidural blood patching . Our case was more severe， with pervasively thin dura and gaps as large as 4 cm. DuraGen could not seal the gaps and epi-dural blood patching would not have resolved this case. Thus， the dural problems presented in this SGS case are more se-vere than those recorded in related connective tissue disorders.\n\n【71】Unfortunately， it is difficult to detect dural insufficiencies pre-operatively. CSF leakage may be indicative of compromised dura because the dura mater holds in the CSF . CT and MRl scans do not allow for proper examination of the dura unless it is inflamed.\n\n【72】Once detected， dural deficiency can be treated in several ways. In our case， patches of DuraGen， a dural-sealing adhesion bar-rier matrix， were placed. Additional dural supplements have been used to treat CSF leakage. A 2014 paper by Goldschmidt provided evidence that growth factors， including insulin， FGF-2， and human serum， can aid in dural closure by facilitating cell migration . Epidural blood patches can be used to nonin-vasively treat symptoms of CSF leakage and perforated dura. This method exerts the “mass effect\"， which is when injection of the patient's own blood propels CSF into the cranium and increases intracranial pressure . In a 2011 study by Burkett， patients who received dural sealants had shorter average hos-pital stays and time in intensive care units， decreased need for additional incisions， and decreased lumbar CSF drainage than those treated with autologous fat graft and lumbar drain re-placement . This indicates that application of dural sealants may be the most effective treatment for compromised dura.\n\n【73】Collagen is a crucial part of the cardiovascular system because it is a protein in the matrix that supports the shape of blood vessels . Thus， collagenopathies are linked to aortic and peripheral aneurysms .\n\n【74】In our patient， surgery was used as treatment for midface hypoplasia， which was caused by craniosynostosis . This symptom spurred surgical intervention because it hin-dered quality of life. In our patient， midface hypoplasia caused lagophthalmos and airway obstruction， which contributed to breathing difficulties and obstructive sleep apnea. The sever-ity of these symptoms should be weighed against the risk of this type of surgery， considering the findings in the present re-port. Posterior distraction may be a safer alternative to the ex-ternal methods used here. Dural issues and consequent bloodloss may be avoided in this procedure because the dura re-mains attached to the “endocranial surface of the vault bone.”This surgery was successful in treating midface hypoplasia in an Antley-Bixler Syndrome patient， but further investigation is needed regarding application to SGS .\n\n【75】Table 3.

Although amelanotic melanoma contains a few melanin granules， it is often difficult to differentiate from non-epithelial malignant tumors. Immunohistochemical staining may be needed to diagnose the condition.\n\n【2】Case Report： This report describes a case of amelanotic melanoma of the rectum， which was originally suspected to be an adenocarcinoma， but was subsequently correctly diagnosed by immunohistochemical staining with HMB-45 an-tibody and by the presence of 5-100 protein. A pinkish-red ulceroproliferative growth was located about 7 cm from the anal verge. The patient was treated by laparoscopic low anterior resection.\n\n【3】Conclusions： Very few cases of amelanotic melanoma of rectum have been reported in the literature and there is only lim-ited clinical experience with this disease. It appears to be a highly lethal tumor and may need much more ag-gressive treatment than that used for carcinoma of the rectum.\n\n【4】Key words： anorectal melanoma · immunohistochemistry· low anterior resection · laparoscopyPrimary anorectal melanoma is a rare and highly lethal neo-plasm with poor prognosis ， which was first reported in 1857 by Moore . Mucosal melanomas account for ap proximately 1.2% of all melanomas， and anorectal melano-mas account for fewer than 25% of all mucosal melanomas. Anorectal melanomas are exceedingly rare， accounting for only0.3% of melanomas and 0.8% of anorectal malignancies . Furthermore， approximately 30% of anorectal melanomas are amelanotic and can endoscopically resemble benign polypoid lesions. Owing to its rarity and histological variability， misdiag-nosis as lymphoma， carcinoma， or sarcoma is common . Histological evaluation with immunohistochemical stains like HMB-45 (Human Melanoma Black-45)， S-100 (Soluble 100%)， and Melan A (melanoma-associated protein A) is often re-quired for definitive diagnosis. Because 61% of patients with anorectal melanomas already have distant metastases at the time of diagnosis， the prognosis is very poor， with a median post-treatment survival time of 12-20 months and a 5-vear survival rate of 6-22%. To date， approximately 500cases of anorectal melanoma have been reported in the liter-ature ， including fewer than 15 cases of amelanotic mel-anoma. Due to its rarity， amelanotic melanoma treatment is not standardized and it still remains a highly aggressive tu-mor. We present a case of amelanotic melanoma of the rec-tum， originally suspected to be a poorly differentiated adeno-carcinoma， but subsequently correctly diagnosed by HMB-45and S-100 protein immunohistochemistry.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】A 55-year-old man presented to the outpatient department with a 3-month history of worsening constipation， tenesmus，6-kg weight loss， and passage of scant blood in his stool. Digital rectal examination revealed an irregular firm mass along the anterior wall of the rectum， and the patient was referred for a colonoscopy. Routine blood test reports were norma. except for mild anemia and CEA of 31.15 ng/ml. Colonoscopy showed an ulceroproliferative growth involving the lower part of the rectum  with lower border about 7 cm from the anal verge. There was no pigmentation of the tumor. Colonoscopic biopsy indicated an undifferentiated adenocarcinoma. CT scan showed a mass involving the lower rectum with periserosal infiltration. No lymphadenopathy or liver metastasis were noted. The patient underwent laparoscopic low anterior re-section and the specimen was sent for histopathological ex-amination. Histological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed a cluster and nests of neoplastic cells having pleo-morphic nuclei invading the lamina propria with evidence of lymphovascular emboli .Tumor margins was nega-tive. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the tumourcells were positive for HMB-45 antibody and S-100 protein. These findings supported the diagnosis of an amelanotic melanoma. While receiving chemoradiation therapy， the patient developed metastatic inguinal lymphade-nopathy. This signifies the highly aggressive nature of amel-anotic melanoma.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Melanomas are malignancies that can affect any anatomic re-gion where melanocytes exist (eg， the epidermis， eyes， nasal cavity， oropharynx， vagina， urinary tract， rectum， and anus). The most common form of melanoma involves the epidermis and constitutes 91.2% of melanoma cases， whereas ocular and mu-cosal forms account for 5.3% and 1.3% of cases， respectively. The remaining 2.2% of cases are from unknown primary sites. Anorectal melanoma is an exceedingly rare mucosal me-lanocytic malignancy， constituting only 0.3% of melanomasand 0.8% of anorectal malignancies .The median age at di-agnosis is 66 years， with a 60% female predominance \n\n【9】The diagnosis of malignant melanoma is readily made if mela nin pigment is present. Malignant melanoma usually presents as a black or brown lesion. It is readily diagnosed by conven-tional histochemical staining； however， amelanotic melanoma， which is a unique variant of malignant melanoma， can be mis-diagnosed as a carcinoma or sarcoma because of the lack of pigmentation. It has been recently reported that immunohis-tochemical staining with HMB-45 is useful for the cytological and histological diagnosis of amelanotic melanoma. The HMB-45 antibody stains a 10-kDa cytoplasmic glycoprotein thought to be part of the premelanosome complex. HMB-45 can be im-portant in the evaluation of undifferentiated neoplastic lesions that are suspected to be melanomas .\n\n【10】In our case， the tumor was unpigmented， and melanin gran-ules were not demonstrated by conventional histochemical staining or Fontana-Masson silver staining. Because of these findings， we initially suspected a non-epithelial malignant tu-mor. Subsequently， immunohistochemical staining for sever-al different antigens was performed. Immunohistochemical staining with HMB-45 demonstrated melanin granules in the tumor cells； thus， this case was ultimately diagnosed as an amelanotic melanoma.\n\n【11】Conclusions\n\n【12】Amelanotic melanomas can be misdiagnosed as carcinomas or sarcomas because of the small number of melanin granules.\n\n【13】Immunohistochemical staining with HMB-45 and S-100 is use ful for the cytological and histological diagnosis of amelanot-ic melanoma.\n\n【14】Amelanotic melanoma is a highly aggressive tumor and， since the reported cases in literature are very few， the treatment is not standardized.\n\n【15】In our case， despite negative tumor margins and good lymph node clearance， the patient developed recurrence in the form of inguinal lymphadenopathy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It is most often caused by infec-tion or autoimmune vasculitides such as giant cell or Takayasu's arteritis.\n\n【1】Case Report： The case presented is that of a 55-year-old man with symptomatic occlusion of the right coronary artery caused by a plasmacytic aortitis suggestive of IgG4 disease， which was successfully treated with coronary artery by-pass grafting and an ascending aortic graft.\n\n【2】Conclusions： A review of the current literature emphasizes how poorly the etiology and natural history of plasmacytic aor-titis is understood.\n\n【3】MeSH Keywords： Aortic Aneurysm · Aortitis·lmmunoglobulin G\n\n【4】Aortitis is a condition characterized by inflammatory infiltra-tion of the aortic wall in response to autoimmune cell signal-ing ， as seen in Takayasu's arteritis and giant cell arte ritis， or with infections such as syphilis ， salmonella， and tuberculosis. Typically， patients with aortitis have either aor-tic dissections or aneurysms due to chronic inflammation.A small subset of patients have predominantly plasmacytic aor-titis of uncertain etiology. Recently lgG4 related disease has been associated with plasmacytic aneurysmal disease of the ascending aorta  as well as inflammatory infrarenal ab-dominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) . This case report describes an atypical presentation of plasmacytic aortitis in which the symptoms were due to inflammatory occlusion of the ostium of the right coronary artery.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】The patient was a 55-year-old African American man who pre-sented to the Emergency Department of a peripheral hospital with complaints of vague chest pain， nausea， and dizziness. In the Emergency Department he suffered a cardiac arrest sec-ondary to ventricular fibrillation. He was quickly resuscitat-ed and did not have any neurological deficit. CT angiography was suggestive of intramural hematoma of the ascending aor-ta and arch . He was transferred to our institution for further evaluation.\n\n【7】Cardiac catheterization revealed a severe stenosis of the os-tium of the right coronary artery， with otherwise normal cor-onary arteries . Because the coronary stenosis ap-peared to be due to compression from the suspected intramural hematoma， he was taken to the operating room for surgical repair. Intra-operatively， the ascending aorta was noted to be firm with a thick wall . There was no evidence of dis-section or intramural hematoma.Transection of the ascendingaorta revealed extreme thickening and edema of the aortic wall consistent with vasculitis. The right sinus of Valsalva also had evidence of inflammation causing severe stenosis at the ori-gin of the coronary artery. The aortic valve and remaining si-nuses of Valsalva appeared normal. The ascending aorta was resected and replaced from the sinotubular junction to the in-nominate artery with a 28-mm Dacron tube graft with end-to-end anastomoses. A saphenous vein bypass graft to the right coronary was then performed. In retrospect， if the diagnosis of aortitis had been clear， perhaps the right coronary steno-sis could have been corrected with a percutaneous stent. The patient tolerated the procedure without complications. He recovered rapidly and was discharged on the 7th postopera-tive day on oral steroid therapy. He returned with a superfi-cial wound infection at the saphenous vein harvest site， which healed well with conservative management. He remains asymp-tomatic with no evidence of aortic aneurysmal disease by CT scan. Pathology examination of the ascending aorta revealedaortitis with marked fibrous thickening of the aortic wall and prominent hyaline thickening of vaso vasorum vessels， many of which were surrounded by significant， predominantly plas-macytic， chronic infiltration. Gram stain， fungal cultures， and AFB cultures were all negative. Qualitative and quantitative RPR (rapid plasma reagin) and syphilis lgG and IgM antibodies were also negative. Steiner staining of the aortic wall showed no spirochetes. Tissue staining for IgG4 revealed less than 30%of plasma cells were positive for IgG4. Serum IgG4 levels were normal， but the laboratory specimen was collected after treat-ment with oral steroids.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Aortic aneurysms involving all segments of the aorta from the ascending to the infrarenal anatomy have long been recog-nized and attributed to a variety of autoimmune etiologies in-cluding Takayasu's arteritis and giant cell arteritis and other rheumatologic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis， Behget's disease， and Cogan’s syndrome . However， a significant minority of cases (<10%)， usually classified as idiopathic，are associated with predominantly plasmacytic infiltrates rath-er than macrophages and lymphocytes. Some of these cases may be related to IgG4 disease but the etiology of other cas-es remains obscure.\n\n【10】IgG4-related aneurysmal disease has recently been identified in aneurysms affecting all segments of the aorta and may be an important etiology of inflammatory infrarenal AAA. IgG4-related disease has been identified with aneurysms of the thoracic aorta， but the criteria to establish the disease re main vague and undetermined . All cases demonstrate\n\n【11】Conclusions\n\n【12】The understanding of the etiology， diagnosis， natural history， and response to therapy for plasmacytic aortitis aneurysmal disease are poor.

Perhaps， bupropion， an atypical antidepressant， may not be useful for smoking cessation ifpatients are hypertensives and well treated with specific drugs. This drug is unable to reduce cardiovascular risksin those patients.\n\n【3】BACKGROUND\n\n【4】Control of risk factors and enhancement of protective factors are the keystones to avoid hemorrhagic stroke. Smoking cessation is important for the prevention of this illness . The use of pharmacological agents to control tobacco addition is irrefutable . Unfortunately， first-line therapies are not always safety . Some of these drugs are able to induce cardiovascular adverse events. Here， we present a case of a hypertensive patient with a hemorrhagic stroke due to drug-drug interaction， by the addition of an atypical antidepressant for smoking cessation to her well control antihypertensive treatment.\n\n【5】CASE REPORT\n\n【6】A 44-year-old woman was referred to the hospital because of left frontal headache， nausea and vomit-ing. On admission， the patient was conscious and had a blood pressure of 200/100 mm Hg. The neurologi-cal examination revealed a mild motor aphasia， a left hemiparesis and a slight neck retraction. The patient was diagnosed 10 years ago of essential hypertension and treated with bisoprolol (10 mg per day). She hadalso been a smoker for 25 cigarettes per day， but she had discount smoking approximately 2 months ago.10 days before she stopped smoking she began to be treated with bupropion (150 mg per day). The labo-ratory studies were all normal， except for a high plas ma glucose levels (200 mg/dl). Computerized tomog-raphy， an established tool for the diagnosis of stroke， demonstrated different signs of acute haemor-rhage stroke .\n\n【7】DISCUSSION\n\n【8】Per se smoking and hypertension are established risk factors for hemorrhagic stroke in men . In both cases pharmacological agents could be used to favour smoking cessation  and reduce blood pres-sure levels . However， the combination therapy using an antihypertensive drugs and antidepressants for to treat both diseases at the same time may notbe safer， as we shown in this case report， and not necessary could be related to a drug-drug interaction on CYP2D6 metabolism \n\n【9】It is certainly that the rise in blood pressure was the potential mediator that caused the rupture of brain arteries and produced the hemorrhagic stroke in this young woman. In our case report the neurovisualiza-tion confirmed the brain damage. Nevertheless， the woman was previously well treated with bisoprolol， a selective p-adrenoceptor antagonist devoid of par-tial agonist activity that is often used for the treat-ment of hypertension . Perhaps， the secondary addition of bupropion chronically to the beta-blocker could induce the hypertensive emergency.\n\n【10】Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant using for smoking cessation . Experimental data have evidenced that this drug is a relatively weak inhibitor of norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake mecha-nisms. This drug has also an indirect role on serotonin(5-HT) neuronal elements . Bupropion is able to increase plasma norepinephrine levels in rats ，an important mechanism to develop hypertension and favour stroke . Recently data in healthy male sub-jects demonstrate that the main mechanism of actionof bupropion is to enhance synaptic availability of nor-epinephrine by increasing its release .\n\n【11】For several authors， hypertension is considered as a confounder factor between the possible connexion of the use of antidepressants and stroke . In gener-al， pharmaceutical products containing bupropion are not related to an increase risk for stroke. although several reports evidence an exacerbation ir baseline hypertension . We must to observe that in hypertension there is an increase in the densi-ty of sympathetic innervation in human and a faulty norepinephrine reuptake . If we give bupropion chronically in combination with a selective β一adrenoceptor antagonist， like bisoprolol， we did not inhibit all the vascular effects of norepinephrine， a neurotransmitter of the sympathetic nervous system that stimuli different subtypes of a- and B-adreno-ceptors. In the vast majority of vascular tissues(arteries and veins)， a-adrenoceptors-mediated vasoconstriction and a-adrenoceptors-mediated the neural complex system regulating cardiovascular function . A chronic increase in norepinephrine levels could evoke more increase in vascular tone and an overactivation of somatodendritic a，-adreno-ceptors. Desensitization of a-adrenoceptors， sec ondary to an increased exposure to the endogenous agonist ligand norepinephrine or prolonged occupa tion of the norepinephrine transporter ， could produce more hypertension. It is not yet known whether all a-adrenoceptor subtypes are predomi-nantly implicated. Perhaps， in this case report the association between bupropion and bisoprolol， a drug-drug interaction would be the cause of the exa-cerbation of the hypertension and the production of the hemorrhagic stroke that could never be mention.\n\n【12】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【13】Drug therapy is a logical approached.

{"seq_id": "76ac40aa-37b2-4e5e-86bb-19f52f53dc6c", "title": null, "text": "【0】ABSTRACT Background： Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (RLNP) is a frequent and potentially serious complication of thyroid surgery. Various risk factors can predict the likelihood of this complication so that careful anticipation in high-risk cases can help in reducing the incidence. In this study we explored the factors associated with RLNP during thyroid surgery in a tertiary care setting. Materials and methods： Eight hundred fifty patients who underwent thyroidectomy in our institution were studied retrospectively . Baseline and other operative factors associated with RLNP in the immediate postoperative period were analyzed using univariate and multivariate methods. Results： RLNP occurred in 6.7% of the 850 patients included in the study. After multivariate adjustment， RLNP was independently associated with increasing age， retrosternal extension and total thyroidectomy with neck dissection. Though male gender， previous neck surgery， total thyroidectomy and near-total thyroidectomy showed an increased risk of RLNP， the risk was not significant. Conclusions： Increasing age， retrosternal extension and total thyroidectomy with neck dissection showed a significantly increased risk of RLNP in the immediate post thyroidectomy period in this series of 850 patients.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Thyroidectomy， Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Palsy， Risk Factors\n\n【2】Background\n\n【3】Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy is a common complication in thyroid surgeries. Though improved surgical techniques have reduced the rate of this complication， the unexpected recurrent laryngeal injury still is unavoidable . The injury to the nerve is often trivial， and transection is only seen 0.3% of all thyroidec-tomy done . The injury can result due to variant anatomy， partial or complete transection， overstretching of the nerve due to traction， contusion， clamping，ligation- mostly ligation of infe-rior thyroid artery， diathermy， edema and ischemia . Other than these， factors like intraoperative haemorrhage， causing improper visualization leading to unplanned clamping and elec-trocoagulation， malignant infiltration， stretching of the nerve can cause injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve . Other risk factors implicated are a type of surgery， neck dissection， presence of malignancy， extrathyroidal invasion， repeat surgery retrosternal extension and Graves' disease J. More careful dissection and intraoperative nerve monitoring can decrease the rate of this complication ，particularly in high-risk patients.\n\n【4】The present study aims to explore the factors affecting the risk of RLNP in patients during the immediate postoperative period. This institution-specific data is important in planning thyroidectomies so that the rate of RLNP can be reduced.\n\n【5】Materials and Methods\n\n【6】This was a retrospective descriptive study of patients aged 13years and above， who underwent all types of thyroidectomy in the Department of General Surgery of Government MedicalCollege， Thiruvananthapuram，Kerala during the period from January 2017 to December 2018. A list of all thyroidectomy cases was made from the histopathology register from the Depart-ment of Pathology， Computer database and Surgery register after deduplication. After obtaining the Inpatient Numbers (IP) num-bers， the case records were retrieved from the Medical Records Library of our institution after getting formal permission from the custodian.\n\n【7】For safeguarding the RLN， extracapsular dissection is prac-tised wherein the surgeon carefully dissects very close to the thyroid gland tackling each tertiary branches individually till the RLN is encountered. Magnifying lenses or microscopes are not used in our setting while dissecting RLN. Facility for in-traoperative nerve monitoring is not available in our hospital. The diagnosis of RLNP in the immediate postoperative period was made by combining postoperative hoarseness， documented intra-operative recurrent laryngeal nerve injury by the surgeon or lack of movement of the cords as documented by the anaes-thetists while extubating the patients undergoing thyroidectomy. 1S We collected data on all possible risk factors available in the case records. Those with pre-existing vocal cord palsy on indirect laryngoscopy and incomplete case sheets were excluded.\n\n【8】Statistical Analysis\n\n【9】Data analysis was performed using R software； the baseline demographic and clinical variables were described using the de-scriptive statistics. Quantitative variables were summarized as mean and standard deviation， while qualitative variables were tabulated as frequency and percentage. The factors associated with RLNP following thyroidectomy in the immediate postop-erative period were modelled with multiple logistic regression analysis. RLNP was analyzed concerning age， gender， previ-ous neck surgery， type of surgery， retrosternal extension， and histopathology with complete case analysis.\n\n【10】Results\n\n【11】Among the 850 patients who underwent thyroidectomy， the ma-jority were females (90%). The mean(SD) age was 41.6(12.6). By routine pre-operative indirect laryngoscopy pre-operative vocal cord palsy was present only in 14(1.7%) patients with missing data for six patients. These patients were excluded from fur-ther analysis. There was a history of previous neck surgery in61(7.2%) with seven missing data. The retrosternal extension was present in 73(8.6%) patients with no information available for six patients. Most of the patients (69.6%) underwent to-tal thyroidectomy with 22 (2.6%) underwent neck dissection in addition. In the postoperative period， five patients needed re-exploration. Only three patients sustained intraoperative recurrent laryngeal nerve injury out of 836 patients， and one patient had vocal cord paresis on inspection by indirect laryn-goscopy after thyroidectomy. Only around 6.7% (56/836) of these patients developed post thyroidectomy RLNP including those with injury， paresis on indirect laryngoscopy and postop-erative hoarseness in the immediate postoperative period. The per-operatively tracheal injury occurred in 7 patients， and one patient had an oesophagal injury.\n\n【12】Univariate analysis showed a significant association of RLNP only with age， retrosternal extension and total thyroidectomy with neck dissection.  Multivariable logistic regression was performed to study the association of age， gender， history of previous neck surgery， retrosternal extension， type of surgery，and histopathology (malignant vs benign) with immediate post-operative RLNP. We included all apriori selected predictors in the multivariable logistic regression. Assumptions of logistic regression were met. The logistic regression model was statis-tically significant， x2=46.69，p<.001. The model explained11.0% (Nagelkerke R2) of the variance in the outcome. Of the six predictor variables， only three were statistically significant： age， retrosternal extension and neck dissection. \n\n【13】Patients who underwent neck dissection in addition to total thyroidectomy had 12.3 times higher odds to develop RLNP in the immediate post-surgical period than those without neck dissection. Increasing age was associated with an increased likelihood of developing RLNP. The retrosternal extension also showed a significant affect with 2.18 times higher odds to de-velop RLNP when compared to patients without a retrosternal goitre. Though male gender， previous neck surgery， total thy-roidectomy and near-total thyroidectomy showed an increased risk of RLNP， the risk was not significant.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】The morbidity associated with RLNP can range from trivial symptoms like transient hoarseness to even stridor necessitat-ing tracheostomy. Knowledge of the risk factors influencing RLNP can help in planning careful dissection and monitoring in the perioperative and postoperative period. Our objective was to evaluate the risk factors for RLNP in the immediate post-thyroidectomy period， and we could find a significant risk for RLNP with increasing age， retrosternal extension and in patients for whom neck dissection was done along with total thyroidec-tomy in our study.\n\n【16】Previous studies have shown that various factors like the type of thyroid surgery， history of neck dissection， the histopatho-logical diagnosis of malignancy， repeat surgeries， retrosternal extension etc. have been found to increase the risk of RLNP in patients undergoing thyroid surgery .\n\n【17】Male gender was associated with increased risk of RLNP in studies done by Kareem et al. and Khanzada et al. In our study， though we found an increased risk of RLNP in males， it was not statistically significant. The study done by Zakaria et al. where 23.5% of subjects were males reported a difference in the incidence of RLNI in males (4.1% in males vs 3.8% in females)， but that was also insignificant . Our study had only10% male subjects which explain the lack of significance for an increased risk for male subjects.\n\n【18】Increasing age has also been implicated in increasing the risk of post thyroidectomy RLNP . We also found a signifi-cantly increased risk of RLNP with increasing age. Few other studies on thyroid malignancies have shown an increased risk of post thyroidectomy RLNP with age . As reported in previous studies， patients over 65 years of age， and particu-larly those over 80， have significantly more complications than younger patients . According to Bergenfelz et al.， the elderly had a greater risk for transient vocal fold paralysis than other adult patients (odds ratios of 1.92 vs 1.04).\n\n【19】The risk of post thyroidectomy RLNP varies with the type of surgeries and whether neck dissection was done or not. Zakaria et al.， in their study showed that total thyroidectomy， re-operation for recurrent goitre significantly increased recurrent laryngeal nerve injury . Erbil et al found a 12-fold increased risk for RNLP in extended thyroidectomy compared to conserva-tive surgery . When the effect of the different types of thyroid surgeries was analyzed in our study， total thyroidectomy andnear-total thyroidectomy were associated with increased risk for RLNP similar to the results from all these studies. There was a significantly increased risk of RLNP in our study subjects who underwent neck dissection along with thyroidectomy. This was similar to the study by Godballe et al. This might be due to the fact that the extent of dissection increases the chance of injury， traction and ischemia of the nerve.\n\n【20】Table 1 Unadjusted Odds ratios for risk of recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy1OR = Odds Ratio， CI= Confidence Interval\n\n| Characteristic  | \\[ALL1  | no RLNP  | RLNP  | OR  | p.ratio  | p.overall  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | N=830  | N=774  | N=56  |  |  |  |\n| Age  | 40.0；  | 40.0；  | 48.0；  | 1.05；1.071  | <0.001  | <0.001  |\n| Gender  | 84(10.1%)  | 77(9.95%)  | 7(12.5%)  | 1.32；  | 0.530  | 0702  |\n| Previous neck surgery  | 56(6.80%)  | 51(6.63%)  | 5(9.09%)  | 144；  | 0.478  | 0.412  |\n| Retrosternal extension  | 71(8.56%)  | 58(7.50%)  | 13 (232%)  | 3.74；7221  | 0.001  | <0.001  |\n| Type of Surgery：  |  |  |  |  |  | 0.016  |\n| near total thyroidectomy  | 102(12.4%)  | 98(12.8%)  | 4(7.14%)  |  |  |  |\n| subtotal thyroidectomy  | 14(1.70%)  | 14(1.82%)  | 0(0.00%)  |  |  |  |\n| total thyroidectomy  | 577(70.0%)  | 531(69.1%)  | 46 (82.1%)  |  |  |  |\n| with neck dissection  | 22 (2.67%)  | 18(2.34%)  | 4(7.14%)  |  |  |  |\n| Malignant Histopathology  | 142(172%)  | 133(17.3%)  | 9(16.1%)  | 0.93；  | 0.843  | 0.959  |\n\n【22】Table 2 Adjusted odds ratios for risk of recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy.\n\n| Characteristic  | OR  | 95% CI  | p-value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Type of Surgery  |  |  |  |\n| near total thyroidectomy  | 2.24  | 0.42，16.7  | 0.4  |\n| total thyroidectomy  | 3.60  | 1.05，22.6  | 0.085  |\n| with neck dissection  | 12.3  | 1.90，106  | 0.011  |\n| Histopathology  |  |  |  |\n| malignant  | 0.71  | 0.28，1.56  | 1.4  |\n| Age  | 1.03  | 1.01，1.06  | 0.012  |\n| Sex  |  |  |  |\n| male  | 1.02  | 0.38，2.35  | \\>0.9  |\n| Previous neck surgery  |  |  |  |\n| previous neck surgery  | 1.26  | 0.41，3.20  | 0.7  |\n| Retrosternal extension  |  |  |  |\n| Retrosternal extension  | 2.18  | 0.97，4.56  | 0.047  |\n\n【24】High rates of RLNP has been reported by various investiga-tors. Risk of permanent nerve injury in repeat thyroidectomy was 0.74% and for primary surgery was 0.13% (p value=0.01) whereas for transient RLNP rates were 4.41% and 1.13% (p value=0.02) respectively in a review of 2422 thyroidectomies by Hayward et al. Previous neck surgeries showed a posi-tive though the non-significant effect in our study. This high risk can be due to the scar tissue formation from previous surgery and change in the dissection planes consequent to that . Our findings confirm the findings from similar studies . Of the total surgeries， only 6.8% were repeat surgeries. Lack of significance in our study may be due to this smaller number. Jatzko et al. reported an incidence of post thyroidectomy RLNP of 8% in recurrent benign goitre， whereas it was almost absent in primary surgery. They also reported that in cases where nerve could not be identified， RLNP came to even 30% .\n\n【25】Various studies showed increased risk of RLNP with ma-lignancy . This may be due to the malignant infiltration of the nerve or extensive surgery . When the histopathological diagnosis was analyzed， we could not find an increased risk of RLNP with the presence of malignancy which was unexpected. Similar lack of association was also observed by Osmolski et al. This is likely due to the small event rate in our study group.\n\n【26】The incidence of postoperative recurrent laryngeal nerve in-jury is higher in surgery for retrosternal goitre than in goitre without retrosternal extension which was due to change in posi-tion of the nerve by compression of the surrounding tissues. In a retrospective analysis of 97 patients with retrosternal goitre， the incidence of transient vocal cord paralysis was 9.2%. An Italian multicentre study which compared cervical goitres and substernal goitres concluded that substernal goitre was associated with a significantly increased risk of RLNP . In our study also， we found a significant increase in the risk of RLNP in patients with retrosternal extension.\n\n【27】The strength of this study is that it is a single centre experi-ence and had a relatively large number of subjects with mini-mum missing data. The limitation of the study is its retrospective nature. Also， indirect laryngoscopy was not done postopera-tively in all the subjects.\n\n【28】Conclusion\n\n【29】This study showed that increasing age， retrosternal goitre and total thyroidectomy with neck dissection had a significant asso-ciation with RLNP in the immediate post thyroidectomy period. Though there was an increase in association of RLNP with gen-der， extend of surgery and previous neck surgery， they were not statistically significant. This institution-specific rates and risk factor assessment will help us to formulate proper patient selection and individualize the adoption of surgical techniques. Further prospective studies are required for substantiating our findings.\n\n【30】Abbreviations\n\n【31】RLNP： Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Palsy", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Our case is the first case to show two coinciding conditions； one is the association of GIT AL amyloidosis with the incidental finding of a rare type of MGUS (LC-MGUS) and the other is the radiologic presentation of GIT amyloidosis with omental calcification mimicking the GIT malignancy.\n\n【2】Case Report： A 68-year-old female presented with symptoms of partial bowel obstruction， including intermittent diffuse ab-dominal pain and constipation. After computed tomography (CT) abdomen and pelvis， an exploratory laparot-omy was needed because of suspicion of abdominal carcinomatosis due to diffuse omental calcification. The tissue sent for biopsy surprisingly showed AL amyloidosis. The patient did not report any systemic symptoms. Further workup was advised to inquire about the plasma cell dyscrasia which eventually turned into a very rare version of MGUS knows as light chain MGUS (LC-MGUS). Following adequate resection of the involved struc-tures， the patient was then placed on chemotherapy and successfully went into remission.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】This case report illustrates that in an era of evidence based medicine， it is important to show through case reports the association of GIT AL amyloidosis with LC-MGUS， as the literature on this topic is lacking. It also points to the importance of timely intervention that can greatly enhance， not only the only the chances of re-mission but also prevention of further complications such as malignant transformation.\n\n【5】MeSH Keywords： Amyloidosis· Gastrointestinal Neoplasms · Immunoglobulin Light Chains·\n\n【6】Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance\n\n【7】Amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis is caused by the neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells thus it is the only type of amyloido-sis that warrants chemotherapy. It is a very rare disorder only6 to 10.5 cases per million reported in annually in the USA . The presentation of AL amyloidosis depends on the system af-fected， duration， and amount of amyloid deposited. One com-parative study of 423 diagnosed cases of systemic amyloidosis showed no differences in the diagnostic sensitivity of immuno-electron microscopy (IEM) and Congo red staining (75%80%) but the specificity of IEM appears significantly higher (100%versus 80%) . Overall， amyloidosis less commonly involves the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and it rarely becomes symptom-atic. Generally， amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis presents with mal-absorption and Gl bleed while AL amyloidosis manifests with symptoms of mechanical obstruction . Results of one study of 769 patients with primary systemic AL amyloidosis conduct-ed at the Mayo clinic over a period of 12 years showed only one patient (0.13%) presented with obstructive symptoms of GIT and for that patient they were unable to prove an association with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance(MGUS) . The most common plasma cell proliferative disor-der is MGUS . There is a positive linear correlation between MGUS prevalence and age of the patient . Studies also re-port increasing incidence of MGUS， and the overall age-related prevalence of MGUS overtime. Results of one large study pub-lished in 2002， showed that MGUS was the diagnosis of 2% of patients with ages 250 years and 3% with ages 270 . Two more large studies published in 2007 and 2010 report a signif-icant rise in this number with 3.2% in patients age 250 versus5.3% with age 270 years and approximately 9% in patients 85years or older . The conventional MGUS is a pre-malignant asymptomatic disorder which progresses with a rate of around1% per year， to a relevant malignant disorders including AL amyloidosis， multiple myeloma (MM) or Waldenstrom macro-globulinemia . Contrary to conventional MGUS， the prev-alence and rate of malignant progression of light chain-MGUS(LC-MGUS) are significantly lower with only 0.8% of patients age 250 years and 0.3% per year， respectively .\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 68-year-old female patient presented with recurrent episodes of vomiting， diffuse abdominal pain， and constipation. At pre-sentation， her body temperature was 99.3°F (37.4C)， blood pressure 127/88 mm Hg， heart rate was regular at 96 beats/minute and respiratory rate 18 breaths/minute. Physical ex-amination was significant with an ill-looking older female with diffuse abdominal tenderness， guarding， and rigidity. The bow-el sounds were audible but sluggish and no organomegaly ap-preciated； the rest of the examination was within the normallimits. The patient was admitted with the initial impression of bowel obstruction. Urgent computed tomography (CT) ab-domen and pelvis with oral and IV contrast revealed multiple， diffuse， nodular， ill-defined infiltrating masses with innumer-able calcifications in greater omentum filling the peritoneal cavity . Infiltrative involvement of the mesen-tery of small bowel and the transverse and sigmoid colon was also seen. These findings were suggestive of calcified perito-neal carcinomatosis due to some primary Gl malignancy and small bowel obstruction.\n\n【10】Initial blood workup was done and the patient underwent an immediate exploratory laparotomy that was found to have a large omental cake consisting of multiple solid firm masses. Omenectomy was done along with the resection of the small bowel and a bypass to the transverse colon was performed. The postoperative period remained clinically insignificant and the patient was discharged with further follow-up.\n\n【11】Frozen sections of the omental masses and terminal ileum showed fat necrosis only and surprisingly， no evidence of ma-lignancy was found. Permanent sections sent for additional stains with Congo red revealed marked amyloid deposition in the omentum and mesentery. Immunohistochemical typing fol-lowed and the fibrils of light chain-AL amyloid were identified. Subsequently， serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) with im-munofixation was done， followed by the serum free light chain(FLC) assay and the results were consistent with the presence of monoclonal protein (M-protein) without the expression of immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain. Additionally， the lambda subset was significantly higher than the kappa and the re-sultant FLC ratio appeared lower (normal=0.26-1.65). Finally， bone marrow biopsy showed CD 138+ plasma cells compris-ing only 3% of the overall cellularity.\n\n【12】Upon further inquiry on follow-up visits， the patient report-ed no systemic symptoms and the results of hemoglobin，se-rum calcium， and creatinine were within normal limits， both on initial and follow-up labs， and within age-appropriate read-ings. A thorough skeletal survey was devoid of any bone le-sion. Based on the clinical and laboratory findings aforemen-tioned， the diagnosis was consistent with (LC-MGUS). Since the patient was a poor candidate for bone marrow transplant， a bortezomib-based regimen， such as CyBorD (cyclophospha-mide-bortezomib-dexamethasone) therapy， was recommend-ed. The patient went into remission as determined by follow-ups at regular intervals.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Amyloidosis， per se， is a multisystem disorder with biopsy-proven GIT disease accounting for only 3.2% of cases， out ofwhich 80% presents as a spectrum of systemic amyloidosis with evidence of involvement of other organ(s) . GIT dis-ease is more common in AA than AL amyloidosis . One small study showed the duodenum (100%) and stomach (95%) were almost always involved in the Gl amyloidosis， reflect-ing the significance of upper Gl endoscopy and biopsy in sus-pected cases . The clinical presentation and endoscopic findings depend on the pattern of infiltration， which in turn， depends on the chemical nature of amyloid protein depos-its. In AA amyloidosis， the pattern is fine granular deposition spreading widely across the GIT and causing mucosal friability and ulceration that presents mainly with bleeding and symp-toms of malabsorption and only less commonly with obstruc-tion . Whereas， in AL amyloidosis， the deposits heavily penetrate the mucosa，extend across the submucosa to fill the muscularis layer and thereby causing the formation of multiple finger-like polypoidal projections that obstruct lumen of the bowel . Generally， the obstructive symptoms are self-limiting in AA amyloidosis and almost always respond to the medica.treatment such as total parenteral nutrition but， with AL amyloidosis， the intestinal obstruction presents as chron-ic intermittent entity that very often needs surgical interven-tion . The biopsied section of suspected amyloid deposits can be confirmed by direct electron microscopy to visualize the typical appearance and the ability to bind Congo red or thioflavine-T staining.\n\n【15】CT findings for GIT amyloidosis are non-specific， ranging from the normal bowel (most common) to the wall thickening and/or dilation， mesenteric infiltration， and rarely mesenteric ad-enopathy . Amyloidoma of the GIT is a very rare con-dition caused by the patchy accumulation of amyloid depos-its， and presents with obstructive symptoms and gives theimpression of abdominal carcinomatosis on CT scan . No case of obstructive AL amyloid Gl disease associated with MGUS has been reported in literature until now. Our case uniquely shows this association.\n\n【16】By definition， MGUS is an asymptomatic pre-malignant disor-der with serum monoclonal protein (M-protein) <3 g/dL， clon-al bone marrow plasma cells <10% and notably no evidence of end organ damage including hypercalcemia， renal insuffi-ciency， anemia， or lytic bone lesions (CRAB features) . Conventional MGUS includes IgM and non-IgM types，whereas the LC-MGUS is the new， unique entity. Rajkumar et al. pub-lished a large study conducted by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) in 2014 ， which clearly updates the diagnostic criteria for LC-MGUS： 1) abnormal free light chain(FLC) ratio (<0.26 or>1.65)；2) increased level of the appropri-ate involved light chain (increased kappa-K gives ratio >1.65and increased lambda-A gives ratio <0.26)； 3) no expression of immunoglobulin heavy chain； 4) clonal bone marrow plas-ma cells <10%； 5) absence of features of end organ damage(CRAB)； and 6) urinary M-protein <500 mg/day.\n\n【17】Generally， the rate of progression of conventional MGUS to malignant disorder (AL-Amyloidosis， MM， WM) is 1% per year， whereas， that of LC-MGUS is only 0.3% . Results of many large studies show evidence of preceding MGUS in patients diagnosed with AL amyloidosis  and MM . Essentially， factors which may significantly speed up the malignant pro-gression to make it high risk-MGUS are 1) size of the M-protein(21.5 g/dl)， 2) abnormal FLC ratio， and 3) non-immunoglobulin-G (Ig-G) MGUS . The FLC ratio (kappa-lambda ratio， normal=0.26 to 1.65) is a significant and independent risk fac-tor for MGUS progression . A simplified risk-stratificationmodel constructed to estimate the malignant progression of MGUS at 20 years is 58% when all three risk factors are found，37% when any two of the three are found， versus 21% when a single risk factor is identified and only 5% when MGUS is free of all risk factors . As we discussed， because MGUS is an asymptomatic disorder， there is no role for chemotherapy ap-proved. Drugs like lenalidomide and bisphosphonates are un-der continuous trials as they might halt the progression into malignant disorders. Since AL amyloidosis is one of the plas-ma cell proliferative disorders， the definitive treatment is he-matopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Patients who are poor surgical candidates are best treated with bortezomib-based regimens such as cyclophosphamide-bortezomib-dexameth-asone (CyBorD).\n\n【18】Conclusions\n\n【19】This case underscores the significance of the association of LC-MGUS with GIT AL amyloidosis that presents with intesti-nal obstruction. Physicians should be aware of this possibili-ty so they may efficiently identify the diagnosis after relevant investigations and start appropriate management. Timely in-tervention is key to treating an acute presentation and to pre-venting the further malignant possibilities.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

SFTs with insulin-like growth factor-ll (IGF-II) production induce non-islet cell tumor-induced hypoglycemia (NICTH)， referred to as Doege-Potter syndrome.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 70-year-old woman presented with urinary retention， and imaging revealed a huge mass occupying almost the entire pelvic space. She had a history of hysterectomy for leiomyoma of the uterus 7 years earlier. In her present course， she developed hypoglycemia， and NICTH was suspected. Her previous uterine specimen was reexamined， and immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed the specimen to be CD34-positive and alpha-smooth muscle actin-negative， indicating that the uterine specimen was not leiomyoma but SFT. Therefore， the present pelvic tumor was considered to be a recurrence of SFT with NICTH， namely Doege-Potter syndrome. Surgical resection was performed， and the pathological examination showed the same histologic features as the pre-vious uterine specimen， while IHC revealed the present specimen to be positive for CD34， signal transducers and activator of transcription 6， and IGF-II， consistent with the diagnosis of recurrent SFT with IGF-II produc-tion. The patient's hypoglycemia improved after tumor resection. To confirm the IGF-II secretion from the SFT， we conducted immunoblotting of the patient's perioperative serum， with results showing that the strong band of IGF-II in the preoperative serum disappeared after surgery.\n\n【4】Conclusions\n\n【5】Because SFTs， especially those with Doege-Potter syndrome， often recur， sometimes with a very long interval， long-term cautious surveillance is required， even after complete tumor resection.\n\n【6】Keywords： Hypoglycemia · Insulin-Like Growth Factor ll· Solitary Fibrous Tumors·UterusSolitary fibrous tumors (SFTs) are rare mesenchymal fibroblas-tic neoplasms that develop mostly in the thoracic cavity . Although extra-thoracic SFTs have been increasingly reported， such as in the pelvic space ，SFTs of a uterine corpus ori-gin are extremely rare . Ardighieri et al performed a sys-tematic literature review， and found only 13 SFTs of a uterine corpus origin had been reported in the English-anguage liter-ature . They noted that most patients presented with local symptoms related to a leiomyoma-like mass， such as abnormal uterine bleeding， abdominal fullness， or a palpable mass； fur-thermore， all patients underwent surgical resection， and 10 pa-tients who had data available were all alive at 6 to 56 months of follow-up， while 2 patients had developed metastases or lo-cal recurrence.\n\n【7】Approximately 4% to 11.5% of patients with SFT develop non-is-let cell tumor-induced hypoglycemia (NICTH) by secreting high-molecular-weight (HMW) insulin-like growth factor-lI (IGF-II)， which is referred to as Doege-Potter syndrome. The predominant symptom of Doege-Potter syndrome is severe and refractory hy-poglycemia， and hypoglycemic symptoms can sometimes be the initial indicator that leads to the detection of a large tumor by imaging studies and ultimately the diagnosis of an SFT .\n\n【8】We report a case of recurrent SFT of uterine origin accompa-nied by Doege-Potter syndrome that was successfully treated with surgical resection.\n\n【9】Case Report\n\n【10】The patient was a 70-year-old woman who had a history of total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for uterine leiomyoma 7 years earlier. She presented to our hos-pital with a concern of urinary retention. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a huge hypervasculartu-mor occupying most of the pelvic space， compressing the blad-der and rectum ， and she was admitted to our hospi-tal. She was on medication for hypertension and osteoporosis and had no other relevant medical history. About 1 month af-ter her presentation， she felt nocturnal weakness and fatigue every night that lasted until early in the morning， symptoms that were found to be indicative of hypoglycemia.\n\n【11】At admission， her abdomen was slightly swollen， but she had no abdominal pain or tenderness. A laboratory examination at admission showed hypoglycemia (39 mg/dL) and suppressed serum insulin (<2.0 pU/mL) and C-peptide (0.09 mg/mL)， but no anti-insulin antibody. A CT scan showed an almost 12-cm-diameter solid mass with heterogenous enhancement in the pelvic space that was compressing the bladder and rectumto the right . Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that the mass was composed of a low-intensity area on T1-weighted imaging  and a heterogenous iso-to high-intensity area on T2-weighted imaging .\n\n【12】Because she developed hypoglycemic symptoms at night de-spite a low insu lin level， NICTH was suspected and the uterus specimen of 7 years ago was reexamined. Grossly， the tumor was well circumscribed and elastic and firm， and the cut sur-faces were yellow to brown in color. Microscopically，the tumor cells were spindle-shaped and had a patternless arrangement， with collagenous stroma and irregularly dilated vasculature. The tumor cells showed moderate atypia， and the mitosis in-dex was 1 mitosis per 10 high-power fields (HPFs) . Immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed that the specimen was CD34-positive but negative for alpha-smooth muscle actin(SMA)， c-kit， S100， and myoglobin， findings that led to the cor-rect diagnosis of the uterus tumor as SFT instead of leiomy-oma . Therefore， the present pelvic tumor was considered to be the recurrent tumor of the uterus SFT pro-ducing IGF-Il， resulting in hypoglycemia.\n\n【13】It took time to conduct preoperative investigations and to prepare for the operation because of the COVID-19 pandem-ic； therefore， about 1.5 months after her first presentation，tu-mor resection was scheduled following continuous glucose in-fusion. During laparotomy， disseminated tumors were found， and the main pelvic tumor had severely adhered to the rec-tum and left ureter. Tumor resection， including excision of all visible disseminated tumors with combined resection of the rectum (low anterior resection) and left ureter (accompa-nied with ureteroneocystostomy)， was performed. The opera-tion time was 567 min， intraoperative blood loss was 2925 g， and 1560 mL of blood transfusion was performed. The main tumor measured 19 cm in maximum diameter and weighed1050 g . The tumors were solid and elastic soft， and their cut surfaces were yellowish-to grayish-white in col-or . Pathologically， similar to the previous uterine specimen， the tumor was mainly composed of haphazard-ly arranged spindle cells with dilated and staghorn-shaped vasculature and partially necrotic lesions. Tumor cells were denser than in the previous uterine specimen， showing mod-erate atypia， and the mitosis index was 1 mitosis per 10 HPFs. IHC revealed the tumor cells to be positive for CD34 ， signal transducers and activator of tran-scription 6 (STAT6) ， and IGF-II  and neg-ative for alpha-SMA， c-kit， and S100， consistent with the diag-nosis of recurrent SFT with IGF-II production. The Ki67 index was 17% in the main tumor and 3% to 10% in the dissemi-nated tumors .\n\n【14】To support the diagnosis of Doege-Potter syndrome， we conducted an immunoblotting analysis of the patient'sperioperative serum along with homogenized tumor tissue. Clear bands of HMW IGF-II (around 15 kDa) were detected in both the preoperative serum and tumor tissue， but they dis-appeared in the postoperative serum . The patient no longer had hypoglycemia after surgery.\n\n【15】A follow-up CT at 5 months after surgery showed a supposed-ly residual disseminated tumor at the bottom of the pelvis. As she refused re-operation because of her mental illness， which had developed due to postoperative stress disorder， cautious follow-up was conducted. The tumor size did not change dur-ing the follow-up； however， she ultimately died of a cause oth-er than SFT 2 years after the surgery.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】We encountered a very rare case of “malignant\" SFT of uter-ine corpus origin， which had been misdiagnosed as a leiomy-oma. Ardighieri et al reported only 13 cases of SFTs of the uterine corpus in their systematic review， 2 of which had dis-tant metastases or pelvic recurrence at over 6 to 56 months of follow-up . Furthermore， only 1 of the 13 cases present-ed with hypoglycemia， making our case the first uterine cor-pus SFT case to recur after 7 years of follow-up， accompanied by Doege-Potter syndrome.\n\n【18】SFTs are histologically composed of spindled to ovoid cells with indistinct， pale eosinophilic cytoplasm within a variably collagenous stroma  and can mimic many unrelated mes-enchymal and non-mesenchymal tumor entities . CD34is one of the most characteristic conventional IHC markers in SFTs， although gastrointestinal stromal tumors are also posi-tive for CD34 and should be excluded . Recently， strong nuclear STAT6 expression due to a NAB2-STAT6 gene fusion was identified as the most consistent and specific IHC mark-er of SFTs . The 2020 WHO Classification of Soft Tissue Tumours describes that， in addition to the reported histolog-ical features， CD34 and/or STAT6 expression by IHC is essen-tial for a diagnosis . In addition to CD34 and STAT6， bcl2and vimentin are usually immunoreactive in SFTs， whereasSMA and desmin (myocyte marker)， or S-100 and synaptophy-sin (perineural tissue marker)， or c-kit (gastrointestinal stro-mal tumor marker) are negative . Other histological differential diagnoses are synovial sarcoma or deep fibroushistiocytoma (which are both negative for CD34)， or myoperi-cytoma (which usually develops in the extremities and is pos-itive for SMA). We probably would have detected the pelvic tumor much earlier at a much smaller size with close follow-up if the uterine tumor 7 years earlier had been precisely di-agnosed as an SFT by IHC. The pathologist at that time most likely overlooked other possibilities in the differential diagno-sis because leiomyomas are predominantly identified to be non-epithelial uterine tumors. As a result， the pathologist may have not considered IHCs to be required.\n\n【19】Doege-Potter syndrome is a paraneoplastic syndrome associat-ed with SFTs， and its predominant symptom is severe and re-fractory hypoglycemia. Large SFTs (>20 cm) tend to present with this uncommon syndrome . In patients with Doege-Pottersyndrome， neoplastic cells of SFTs overexpress and secret HMW-IGF-II， which is insufficiently processed into IGF-II pro-tein， resulting in NICTH . The IHC of IGF-II is helpful for the diagnosis of Doege-Potter syndrome， while IGF-II overex-pression does not always induce clinical hypoglycemia .\n\n【20】Several studies have confirmed the secretion of HMW-IGF-II us-ing immunoblotting analyses of perioperative serum. In the present case， an immunoblotting analysis revealed that the strong band of HMW-IGF-II in the preoperative serum had disappeared after tumor resection， which is compatible withperioperative serum and resected specimen. The dense band at around15 kDa (high-molecular-weight IGF-Il) in the patient’s preoperative serum(lane 1) disappeared in the patient's postoperative serum (lane 2). The homogenized tumor tissue also had an IGF-II band (lane 3). NC-negative control； PC - positive control； ST -standard of this IGF-II antibody(7kDa).\n\n【21】the clinical improvement of hypoglycemia after surgery. The tumor size is reportedly related to IGF-II production， and over90% of tumors greater than 9 cm in size have IGF-II overex-pression . In our case， the patient had not developed hy-poglycemia until the recurrent tumor had grown to occupy the whole pelvic space.\n\n【22】Surgical resection has been the mainstay of SFT treatment. As SFTs are typically well-circumscribed masses and grow ex-pansively， not invasively， complete tumor resection is usual-ly possible. En bloc resection is not always required， and even piecemeal resection is acceptable for achieving good local con-trol， resulting in a favorable prognosis . However， repeat-ed surgeries for recurrent SFTs or too-large tumors can cause distressful adhesion， and complete surgical resection is con-siderably challenging . To avoid a positive surgical margin and reduce operative blood loss， several studies have report-ed the utility of preoperative transcatheter arterial emboliza-tion， as SFTs are usually hypervascular tumors . In our case， the main pelvic tumor had grown so large that the tu-mor had severe adhesion to the rectum and the left ureter， so it might have been wise to consider preoperative transcathe-ter arterial embolization followed by surgery. Limited studies have additionally reported that systemic chemotherapy and radiotherapy are effective for SFT treatment. Further studies concerning the molecular pathways involved with SFTs are ex-pected to highlight promising molecular targets .\n\n【23】For predicting the recurrence or metastasis of surgically resect-ed SFTs， England’s pathologic criteria are well reported： size over 10 cm， increased cellularity， over 4 mitoses per 10 HPFs， nuclear pleomorphism， and tumor necrosis or hemorrhag-ing . Even “benign\" SFTs that do not meet England's cri-teria are often reported to recur， and recently several risk fac-tors in addition to England's criteria have been proposed， such as an extrathoracic location . Furthermore， SFTs with Doege-Potter syndrome are known to be much more malignant than those without Doege-Potter syndrome， and indeed， Han et al reported that as many as 60% of SFTs with Doege-Pottersyndrome were malignant， compared with only 5% to 10.4%of those without the syndrome . In addition， it should be noted that SFTs sometimes recur many years after the initial surgery . In our present case， because the patient had a huge SFT tumor over 10 cm in size accompanied by Doege-Potter syndrome and already had disseminating tumors， the risk of recurrence was considered very high， so we intended to cautiously conduct follow-up， but she unfortunately died of a cause other than SFT recurrence.\n\n【24】Conclusions\n\n【25】We reported a very rare case of recurrent SFT of uterine ori-gin with Doege-Potter syndrome. We confirmed that the tumor cells had produced and secreted IGF-Il and that the serum IGF-Il had dramatically decreased after tumor resection. Because SFTs， especially those with Doege-Potter syndrome， often re-cur， sometimes with a very long interval， long-term cautious surveillance is required， even after complete tumor resection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The ELKS (E -ear， nose and throat， L-lungs， K-Kidneys， S - skin and mucus membranes) involvement along with gastrointestinal vasculitis presenting as gastrointestinal bleeding is a rare phenomenon and we present a Caucasian female with this presentation.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 59 year old female presented with painful ulcers in the oral pharynx and multiple areas of the skin. Her exam was otherwise negative. But laboratory tests showed renal impairment. Chest CT revealed cavitary lung lesions. C-ANCA and anti-proteinase 3 antibodies were elevated. During the hospital stay she had an episode of gastrointestinal bleeding. She eventually had a lung and kidney biopsy with colonoscopy which all confirmed the diagnosis of vasculitis consistent with Wegener’s Granulomatosis.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】If untreated Wegener's granulomatosis has a poor prognosis， with most patients dying within two years. The use of cyclophosphamide has dramatically increased the longevity of these patients hence prompt diagnosis and treatment of this condition is extremely important， especially in atypical presentations as seen in our patient. Since gastrointestinal vasculitis presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding is rare in patients with WG， confirmatory endoscopic biopsies should be done before attributing this to steroids used commonly in the management of these patients.\n\n【6】Key words： systemic vasculitis ·Wegener ganulomatosis·Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage-bloodWegener’s Granulomatosis (WG) is a rare form of systemic vasculitis involving medium sized to small arteries. The most common systems involved are the upper and lower respiratory tracts and kidneys. There is a limited form， which involves only the respiratory tract. Although it has predilection to the respiratory tracts， WG can involve any major system or organ. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies are usually positive in WG. ELKS (E -ear， nose and throat， L -lungs， K- Kidneys， S - skin and mucus mem-branes) constellation with gastrointestinal involvement is a rare presentation of Wegener's granulomatosis. Here we present a case of ELKS and gastrointestinal vasculitis with hemorrhage.\n\n【7】CASE REPORT\n\n【8】A 59 year-old female presented to emergency room with a one month history of generalized rash. The rash was painful， non-pruritic and evolved into ulcers. Review of symptoms was significant for odynophagia， significant weight loss， myalgia， arthralgia， paresthesias and oliguria. No history of respiratory symptoms or fever. She had an episode of massive rectal bleeding five months before this presentation. Family history was significant for a cavitary lung lesion in her father.\n\n【9】On examination she was a pale and looked older than her stated age with stable vital signs. Her nose was not deformed. Dentition was poor with multiple oral and pharyngeal ulcers which were tender， pale， non-pustu-lar involving the base and sides of the tongue and the hard palate measuring about 2 by 4 cm， see figure 3. The skin ulcers were tender non-blanching palpable purpura of varying sizes， involving the earlobes， trunk， extremities including the palms and soles and in the peri-anal region， see figure 2. There was no peripherallymphadenopathy. The respiratory and cardiovascular examinations were normal. Rectal exam showed guaiac positive brown stool. There were no genital ulcers.\n\n【10】Urinalysis showed hemoglobin 4+ and granular casts. Chest radiograph was unremarkable. Diagnosis of a vasculitic syndrome was entertained.\n\n【11】Patient was started on methylprednisone. Cultures of ulcers， blood and sputum grew Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Repeat chest radiograph showed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates. Chest CT showed diffuse airspace opacities with bilateral ef-fusions and cavitary lesions in the right lung base. Fluoroscopic guided bronchoscopy with biopsy and broncho-alveolar lavage showed acute intra alveolar inflammation with multinucleated giant cells but no granulomatous or vasculitic lesions in those specimens. Acid fast Bacillus (AFB) stain was negative. As Renal function continued to decline a CT- guided kidneybiopsy was performe D10SV W2d which revealed acute necrotiz-ing glomerulonephritis with fibrocellular crescents and acute tubular necrosis， see figure 1. Wegener’s granulomatosis (WG) was confirmed and in addition C-ANCA and anti-proteinase 3 antibodies were signifi-cantly elevated. Oral cyclophosphamide was added.\n\n【12】On hospital day thirteen the patient had two episodes of massive spontaneous gastrointestinal bleeding simi-lar to what she had five months prior to presentation.

The disease is primarily as-sociated with involvement of upper or lower respiratory tracts or both in 90% of cases . Kidney involvement is also often present. A limited form of the disease isolated to the upper respiratory tract or the lungs has also being described. The epidemiology of the disease is largely unknown although incidence has increased， and reported prevalence varies from 24 to 154 cases per million depending on the series. Onset of disease occurs in adulthood 40 to 60 years with equal sex ratio.\n\n【17】Our patient met the criteria for the ELKS syndrome based on the involvement of E (ear ulcers， dysphagia and odynophagia). L (lungs)， cavitary lung lesions. K (glomerulonephritis) S (skins and mucous mem-brane) skin rash and ulcers， and the gastrointestinal bleed was a manifestation of gastrointestinal vasculitis as confirmed by endoscopy.\n\n【18】Clinical Features：\n\n【19】Clinical presentation varies from non specific com-plaints to multi-system involvement. The upperairway involvement may manifest as recurrent and persistent rhinorrhoea，purulent or bloody nasal dis-charge， nasal ulcers， saddle nose deformity subglottic region or trachea involvement， hoarseness， stridor， earache and hearing loss. Pulmonary involvement can affect the parenchyma cavitary lung lesion， en dobronchial tissue and the pleura. Renal involvement is manifested by glomerulonephritis leading to acute renal failure.\n\n【20】Eye involvement can present with a wide range of occular manifestations including conjunctivitis， cor-neal ulceration， episcleritis， scleritis， optic neuropathy， retinal vasculitis anduveitis. Gingival hyperplasia has also being reported as a distinctive sign of Wegener’s granulomatosis .\n\n【21】Skin and mucous membrane vasculitis could present as vesicules， palpable purpura， oral ulcers， skin ul-cers， necrotic papules， hemorrhagic bullae， pustules， genital ulcers， digital necrosis and livedo reticularis. Pattern SF and Tomecki KJ conducted a study to identify clinical and histologic findings of the skin and oral mucosa that may aid in the diagnosis of WG， they noted in their study that cutaneous and oral mu-cosal lesions were a presenting sign in 10% and 5%of the patients respectively . The nervous system could also be involved. Gastrointestinal vasculitis presenting with hemorrhage complicating Wegener’s granulomatosis has being reported although rare. J A G Whitworth andJM Bone stressed the critical need for endoscopy and histologic examination to differentiate the bleeding caused by vasculitis from that secondary to steroid therapy . Shaik， F M and co workers reports showed that symptomatic gastro-intestinal disease in WG is not often reported . Only few well documented cases describing severe forms of disease affecting part of the bowel in the presence of classic lung and renal involvement have been reported.\n\n【22】A study by Knut et al about clinical course in 108patients of WG with renal involvement showed that initial major organ systems involved were as follows：renal 100%， upper respiratory 62%， lungs 51.9%， musculoskeletal system 40.7%， skin 19.4%， eye 18.5%， peripheral nerve 7.4%， central nervous system 1.9%and genitourinary system 0.9%. Bernadette Aymard et al reported a case of perianal ulcer： an unusual presentation of Wegner’s granulomatosis .\n\n【23】Laboratory Findings：\n\n【24】The diagnosis of Wegner’s granulomatosis is sug-gested from clinical and laboratory findings and the presence of circulating antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies.ANCA testing now plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and classification of vasculitis. Types of ANCA are cytoplasmic-ANCA (C-ANCA) and peri-nuclear ANCA (P-ANCA) pattern. ANCA related vasculitis have two target antigens proteinase 3 (PR3) and myloperoxidase (MPO). Antibodies with target specifics for PR3 and MPO are called PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA respectively.\n\n【25】About 90% of active generalized WG are ANCA-posi-tive and up to 80 to 90% have PR3-ANCA and only about 10% are MPO-ANCA positive. The absence of ANCA does not exclude Wegner’s granulomatosis since a significant percentage of limited WG do not have ANCA. The sensitivity of PR3-ANCA for Wegner’s granulomatosis is largely related to the extent， severity and activity of the disease at the time of sampling.\n\n【26】The diagnosis of Wegner’s granulomatosis is confirmed by tissue biopsy at the site of active disease. The nasopharynx is the most non invasive site to sample and this site may reveal a non diagnostic study， since vasculitis of the upper respiratory tract occurs in only about one-third of cases. The skin， kidney or lungs are more diagnostic sites for biopsy. The skin biopsy shows leukocytoclastic vasculitis with little or no comple-ment and immunoglobulins on immunofluorescence. Kidney biopsy is useful in patients with renal involve-ment and typically reveals segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis that is usually pauci-immune on immunofluorescence or electron microscopy， which is diagnostic of small vessel vasculitis.\n\n【27】Lung biopsy often open or thoracoscopic， typically reveals vasculitis and granulomatous inflammation. The absence of granulomatous vasculitis on tran-brochial biopsy should not exclude the diagnosis of Wegner's granulomatosis since sufficient sample may not have been obtained .\n\n【28】Management：\n\n【29】The therapeutic approach to Wegner’s granulomatosis is induction of remission with daily administration of cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoid. When remis-sion is achieved cyclophosphamide therapy should beS101 stopped. Glucocoticoid is often taken daily for the first month and tapered gradually over 6 to 12 months. Maintenance of remission phase can initiated with less toxic agents like methotrexate or azathioprine. The duration of maintainance of remission is about18 months. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole alone maybe effective in upper airway disease， and for pnemocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis in pa-tients receiving cytotoxic agents and glucocoticoids. Biologic agents are under evaluation and may modify disease management in the future.\n\n【30】Prognosis：\n\n【31】The survival of patients with WG has significantly improved over the past decade with aggressive treat-ments of high doses of steroids and cyclophospha-mide. In the 1950’s the mortality was as high as 80%in 1 year with an overall median survival of about5 months . Long term monitoring for disease and treatment associated complications is very crucial. Most common causes of death are related to pulmo-nary or renal involvement. Infection is also associated with significant mortality often related to treatment with immunosuppressive agents.\n\n【32】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【33】Our patient had WG with ELKS constellation of symptoms. (ENT， Lungs， Kidneys， Skin and mucous membranes). This constellation with gastrointestinal vasculitis is a rare presentation. The classical upper respiratory symptoms were minimal in our patient. In retrospect， the massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding five months prior to presentation was probably her initial manifestation of symptomatic disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

A gradual increase in serum potassium followed， with a subsequent return to a normal potassium level after stopping treatment with heparin. An evaluation for hemolysis was unrevealing， and the patient was not on any other medications known to cause hyperkale-mia. On day 6， heparin was restarted owing to a high suspicion of pulmonary embolism. There was a subse-quent increase in serum potassium level， which was followed by a return to baseline after discontinuation of heparin，thereby confirming the suspected diagnosis.\n\n【2】Conclusions： Acute increases in serum potassium levels in hospitalized patients can result in weakness， paralysis， conduc-tion abnormalities， and cardiac arrhythmias that， if left untreated， can result in serious morbidity and poten-tially death in a short period of time. As this clinical entity is infrequently encountered in clinical practice， it can easily be overlooked by clinicians. The prompt exclusion of alternative causes of acutely elevated serum potassium levels and the identification of heparin administration as an easily reversible trigger is imperative and can potentially be life-saving.\n\n【3】Keywords： Acute Coronary Syndrome · Aldosterone· Heparin·Hyperkalemia\n\n【4】Heparin-induced hyperkalemia is a well-established but infre-quently observed event and a diagnosis of exclusion. First rec-ognized in the clinical literature as early as 1964， new cases continue to challenge clinicians to this day . The insidi-ous elevation of serum potassium observed in this clinical en-tity is thought to be the consequence of the inhibitory effects of heparin at the level of the zona glomerulosa， possibly via a reduction in the number and affinity of adrenal angioten-sin Il receptors， causing reversible aldosterone suppression， thereby leading to enhanced sodium excretion and hyperka-lemia. Evidence suggests a slightly lower risk with low-molec-ular-weight heparin .\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】A 77-year-old man with a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes， benign prostatic enlargement， chronic renal disease stage 3B， and nephrectomy for renal cancer presented with a productive cough and shortness of breath，but no chest pain. Three days prior， he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. He was a nonsmoker and denied use of alcohol or any illicit drugs.\n\n【7】On initial presentation， his vital signs were as follows： temper-ature of 36.6℃， blood pressure of 128/69 mmHg， pulse rate of92 beats per min， respiratory rate of 22 breaths per min， and a peripheral oxygen saturation of 92% on non-rebreather mask. He was determined not to be a candidate for treatment with remdesevir for SARS-CoV-2 infection owing to acute kidney in-jury on presentation， but received tocilizumab on hospital day1. On physical examination， he was awake， alert， and oriented， ill in appearance， and in visible respiratory distress， exhibit-ing difficulty speaking in complete sentences. On lung exami-nation， diffuse rhonchi and rales were auscultated bilateral-ly. No murmurs or added heart sounds were appreciated，and+1 pitting edema was noted in the bilateral lower extremities.\n\n【8】Pertinent studies from the time of admission included a se-rum troponin level of 1.97 ng/mL (reference range，<0.3 ng/mL) and an electrocardiogram showing no acute ischemic abnor-malities. Creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels were 2.4mg/dL (reference range， 0.7-1.2 mg/dl) and 67 mg/dL (refer-ence range， 6-20 mg/dl)， respectively， and estimated glomer-ular filtration rate of 28 mL/min/1.73 m² (reference range，>60 mL/min/1.73 m²)， although no prior values were avail-able. The serum potassium level was 5.1 mmol/L (reference range， 3.6-5.1 mmol/L).\n\n【9】Given the patient's presentation of acute respiratory distress(an anginal equivalent) with elevation of serum troponin and in the context of a possible underlying hypercoagulable statedue to concomitant COVID-19 infection， the decision was made to start the patient on a high-dose unfractionated hep-arin drip. As the cause of troponin elevation was thought to be ischemia due to increased demand in the setting of acute kid-ney injury/chronic kidney disease， the patient was never taken for cardiac catheterization. No computed tomography scan or test requiring the administration of intravenous contrast was performed over the course of hospital admission. On hospital day 4， the serum potassium level rose to 5.6 mmol/L (refer-ence range， 3.6-5.1 mmol/L). An evaluation for hemolysis was negative (LDH and haptoglobin was not low). The patient had not received any beta blockers，angiotensin converting enzyme(ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers， calcineurin in-hibitors， or any other medication known to cause elevation of serum potassium； therefore， heparin was stopped and sodi-um polystyrene (kayexalate)， insulin， and dextrose were ad-ministered after the potassium reached a high of 6.2 mmol/L on hospital day 5， resulting in only a slight drop of potassium to 5.5 mmol/L on the following day . Owing to a high clinical suspicion for pulmonary embolism on hos-pital day 6， supported by worsening tachycardia， respiratory distress， and a nonspecific elevation of D-dimer of 15.71 mg/dL (reference range，<0.50)， high-dose heparin was restarted； however， the serum potassium level promptly rose again on the same evening， reaching a level of 6.0 mmol/L. Computed tomography angiography was not obtained owing to the pa-tient's renal function， and in the absence of hemodynamic in-stability， a ventilation/perfusion lung scan was not obtained because the patient was already being treated with system-ic anticoagulation， and findings would have not altered the choice of management. At this time， the diagnosis of hepa-rin-induced aldosterone suppression was strongly suspect-ed， heparin was again discontinued， and the potassium level quickly normalized to 4.8 mmol/L on the fifth evening of ad-mission and remained within normal limits with the heparin withheld .\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Hospitalized patients often require chemical venous throm-boembolism prophylaxis. Unfractionated and low-molecular-weight heparins are preferred because of their favorable safety profile. The exact mechanism for heparin-induced hyperkalemia is not fully understood but appears to be related to a heparin-induced reduction in the number and affinity of angiotensinⅡreceptors in the zona glomerulosa. Angiotensin Il activates cal-cium influx into the zona glomerulosa ， which is the key to aldosterone production； frequent and long-term interrup-tion in this process can result in some degree of loss in cel-lular function and volume. This inhibition of aldosterone syn-thesis can occur within a few days after giving the medication， as observed in our patient， who began to show an increasein potassium level by the fourth day of admission. This phe-nomenon can be observed with a low dosage and with subcu-taneous or intravenous routes， leading to increased excretion of sodium and increased retention of potassium. This effect is reversible after stopping heparin.\n\n【12】Table 1. Serum creatinine and potassium level trend starting from day 1 of admission through day 10. Heparin was started in the evening of day 1， held on day 5 at 02： 55 AM， restarted on day 6， and held in the evening of day 7.\n\n|  | Day 1  | Day 2  | Day 3  | Day 4  | Day 5  | Day 6  | Day 7  | Day 8  | Day 9  | Day 10  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Creatinine (mg/dL)  | 2.4  | 2.1  | 2.0  | 1.8  | 1.7  | 1.7  | 1.7  | 2.1  | 2.1  | 2.1  |\n| Potassium (mmol/L)  | 5.1  | 4.5  | 5.0  | 5.6  | 6.2  | 5.5  | 6.0  | 4.5  | 4.5  | 4.5  |\n| Heparin drip (+/-)  | 十  | 十  | 十  | 十  |  | 十  | 十  |  |  |  |\n\n【14】This process is generally compensated in healthy individuals but is more pronounced in older adults with diabetes and pa-tients with renal insufficiency or failure， as was the case in our patient， with a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease stage 3B . The risk increases with higher doses， prolonged dosages， and unfractionated heparin therapy， and in hospitalized patients on a prophylactic dose of heparin with ACE inhibitors or those who have a baseline potassium level >4.6 mmol/L between days 4and 8 of hospital admission . Therefore， potassium levels should be checked at least every 4 days for patients on hepa-rin for 3 days or more， patients on a high dose of heparin，pa-tients on ACE inhibitors， patients with diabetes， and patients with renal insufficiency . In the present clinical scenario， the chronology， clinical exclusion of other causes， recurrence of hy-perkalemia with heparin administration， and prompt return toa sustained， normal serum potassium level after cessation of heparin supported heparin as the cause of the hyperkalemia.\n\n【15】When hyponatremia and hyperkalemia due to hypoaldoste-ronism are accompanied by a state of metabolic acidosis and a normal anion gap， this condition has been referred to as type 4 renal tubular acidosis and can be stratified by etiolo-gy， based on those associated with reduced aldosterone pro-duction and those associated with increased aldosterone re-sistance. Etiologies related to reduced aldosterone production include those precipitated by a number of medications，includ-ing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs， beta blockers， ACE inhibitors， angiotensin receptor blockers， calcineurin inhibitors， and heparins， while aldosterone resistance can be precipitat-ed by potassium-sparing diuretics as well as by select antibi-otics (namely， trimethoprim and pentamidine) . Due to the absence of laboratory evidence of metabolic acidosis， the pa-tient discussed herein was not thought to fulfill the diagnos-tic criteria for type 4 renal tubular acidosis.\n\n【16】The calculation of a transtubular potassium gradient may be a helpful tool to consider in select cases， as it has demonstrat-ed utility in distinguishing between patients with suspected mineralocorticoid deficiency or resistance. A transtubular po-tassium gradient was not calculated for the present case， as neither urine osmolality nor serum osmolality were obtained over the course of hospital admission， which would have both been necessary to perform the calculation. Additionally， treat-ment with fludrocortisone was not considered owing to the rapid return of the potassium level to normal limits following the discontinuation of heparin .\n\n【17】Unfractionated and low-molecular-weight heparins are most frequently the anticoagulants of choice for non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes owing to their demonstrated ability to reduce the incidence of thrombus-related ischemic events. When heparin must be discontinued due to complications of treatment， such as the development of heparin-induced throm-bocytopenia， or suspected aldosterone suppression， as in our patient， many patients can require ongoing anticoagulation with the selection of an alternative agent. Fondaparinux hasbeen found to offer a similar reduction in the risk of ischemic events and lower bleeding risk and can be considered as a safe alternative in this population .\n\n【18】Conclusions\n\n【19】Acute increases in serum potassium levels in hospitalized pa-tients can result in weakness， paralysis， conduction abnormal-ities， and cardiac arrhythmias that， if left untreated， can result in serious morbidity and potentially death in a short period of time. The differential diagnosis for causes of hyperkalemia in patients like the one discussed herein remains broad. As this clinical entity is infrequently encountered in clinical practice， it can be easily overlooked by clinicians. As such， the prompt exclusion of alternative causes of acutely elevated serum po-tassium levels can be facilitated by taking a detailed historyto rule out the use of other medications known to elevate se-rum potassium， such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatories， beta blockers， ACE inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers， and calcineurin inhibitors. The identification of heparin admin-istration as an easily reversible trigger is imperative and can potentially be life-saving. In the case discussed， the diagnosis of heparin-induced aldosterone suppression was reached by exclusion； however， obtaining standard assays to evaluate se-rum aldosterone， cortisol， and renin levels may aid in circum-stances of diagnostic uncertainty and help identify similarly presenting conditions， such as primary adrenal insufficiency.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

When this endometrial tissue grows and sheds， symptoms will de-velop. The presentation varies depending on the site involved； however， cyclical pain is among its most com-mon symptoms， along with bleeding and cramping. It is frequently observed in the ovaries and fallopian tubes； in contrast， the anal canal is rarely involved. Here， we report a very unusual presentation of the disease.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 33-year-old woman with a history of episiotomy presented to the Emergency Department reporting perianal swelling in the previous year. The swelling was associated with intermittent pain and difficulty passing stool. She reported no fever. On examination， there was a 3x4 cm palpable tender perianal mass extending to the anal sphincter at the 11 o’clock position. Bedside ultrasound revealed a mass. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a hemorrhagic 3x4 cm mass in the right perianal region pressing on and indenting the right aspect of the distal external sphincter. The mass was excised completely with local perianal incision over the mass at11’o clock. Surgical pathology revealed an isolated endometrioma in the perianal area.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】Isolated perianal endometrioma is a rare disease， with only 21 published cases. Its diagnosis is difficult to es-tablish， and a wide range of tests is often needed. Laparoscopic or surgical intervention may be required in cases of rectal endometriosis for an accurate diagnosis. Careful history taking and examination along with a high index of suspicion are necessary to diagnose perianal endometrioma.\n\n【6】Keywords： Anal Canal · Colorectal Surgery·Endometriosis\n\n【7】Endometriosis occurs when the lining of the uterus， the en-dometrium， grows in other places such as the fallopian tubes， along the pelvis， or in the ovaries . When this lining breaks down， it usually has nowhere to go， causing heavy menstrual periods and severe cramps. Endometriosis affects approximate ly 10-15% of women of reproductive age . It most commonly affects women aged 25-35 years. Its incidence increases to as much as 25-50% in infertile women . The criterion standard diagnostic modality is histopathology obtained from laparo-scopic tissue biopsy of endometriotic implants. It most com-monly occurs in the ovaries， anterior or posterior cul-de-sac， the broad and uterosacral ligaments， uterus， fallopian tubes， sigmoid colon， or appendix .\n\n【8】This report describes a case of isolated perianal endometrio-ma. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients for future research and publication.\n\n【9】Case Report\n\n【10】A 33-year-old woman with no known medical illnesses visited the Emergency Department reporting a 1-year history of swell-ing in the perianal area associated with intermittent pain and difficulty defecating. Upon further questioning， she realized that her pain mainly occurred during her menstrual cycle. She denied any history of fever， discharge， or bleeding. She was a para 2 with a history of 2 normal deliveries. The first delivery was 13 years ago and the last delivery was 8 years ago. Both deliveries required an episiotomy. She started to notice the symptoms and the mass 1 year ago. She had no history of con-traceptive use， and she takes paracetamol， with minimal relief.\n\n【11】A physical examination revealed a 3x4 cm palpable tender peri-anal mass extending to the anal sphincter at the 11 o’clock posi-tion. No redness or discharge was observed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 3x4 cm mass in the right perianal re-gion pressing on and indenting the right aspect of the distal external sphincter. This mass showed mixed intermediate and high signal intensity on T2W1， attributed to the hemorrhagic component. There was an associated diffusion restriction but no avid enhancement after intravenous contrast administra-tion. No fatty components were observed. The exact nature of this mass was indeterminate. The incidental finding of a 2x2cm anorectal polyp with stalk was seen at the right posterolat-eral aspect. No signs of invasion beyond the muscularis propria were noted. This polyp was seen approximately 3.1 cm above the anal verge. No mesorectal lymphadenopathy was noted.\n\n【12】The patient was counseled to undergo an examination under anesthesia and possible surgical excision of the mass alongwith anal polyp removal. She agreed to undergo surgery un-der general anesthesia. For the surgery， she was placed in the prone position. Examination of the anal canal showed 3 pol-yps， which were excised. The mucosal defect was closed us-ing 3-0 Vicryl. Attention was then given to the perianal area， in which a cyst was found in the right ischioanal fossa. An el-liptical incision was made that was very close to the external anal muscle； with careful dissection， it was separated and the cyst wall was excised. The mass was completely excised with intact capsule and a less than 1-cm margin. She was shifted back to the day surgery unit in stable condition and discharged later the same day in good condition.\n\n【13】A histopathological examination of the perianal cyst excision revealed a 4x4 cm endometrioma . Surgical pa-thology gross examination showed brown-tan skin tiss ueswith underlining subcutaneous tissue， and the cut section re-vealed heterogeneous yellowish-brown fatty tissue. The anal mucosal polyps were hyperplastic. The patient was seen in the clinic， and the wound healed well. The patient was referred to the Gynecology Department for further assessment and treat-ment. A gynecological ultrasound revealed a retroverted uter-us with no ovarian endometrioma. She was then started on a course of combined oral contraceptive pills to prevent endo-metriosis recurrence.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Perianal endometriosis is extremely rare. It usually occurs in episiotomy scars， and can involve the septum that separates the vagina and anal canal， with an incidence of approximate-ly 0.2%. A clinician might fail to diagnose perianal endo-metriosis if there is no visible scar in the perineum and the patient has never undergone an episiotomy. In addition， it might be difficult to make a diagnosis if the patient does not report feeling cyclical pain； thus， it might be treated as a peri-anal abscess .\n\n【16】As of this writing， 21 these rare cases have been published . Our case brings the grand total to 22. In the review of these cases， perianal endometriosis affected child-bearing women following obstetric or gynecological procedures， which might transplant the endometrial tissue to uncommon sites. Three reported cases revealed that perianal endometri-osis mimicked the presentation of a perianal abscess located in the episiotomy scar . Fifteen of 21 cases involved endometriosis attached to the anal sphincter， and 8 cases re-quired sphincter repair during surgical removal. Because peri-anal abscesses are usually handled by junior surgeons， theunusual presenting features of perianal endometriosis may go unnoticed. This can lead to unnecessary operations or an in-appropriate diagnosis. It is important to be highly suspicious when making a diagnosis， especially when a patient suffers from recurrent perianal pain and no pus is found. Fine-needle aspiration cytology can help make the correct diagnosis . Transanal ultrasonography can aid in accurately gauging the exact endometrioma's anatomical location and involvement of the external sphincter. Thus， painful perianal abrasions are indicative of a perianal abscess； when they recur， Crohn's dis-ease is usually suspected .\n\n【17】Anal endometriosis cannot be diagnosed by physical examina-tion， and imaging techniques must be utilized. Although some patients with anal endometriosis may be asymptomatic，many develop stomach problems . There are no clear guidelines for evaluating patients suspected of having the condition， but the most common presenting medical features include infertili-ty and pelvic pain . However， various techniques have been advocated for its diagnosis， such as double-contrast barium enema， transvaginal ultrasonography， MRl， rectal endoscopic ultrasonography， and multislice computed tomography entero-clysis. The regularity of rectal endometriosis is unknown， but among cases of bowel permeation， approximately 90% are con-tained in the rectum or sigmoid colon ， while the rest are present in the ileum， appendix， and cecum . This results in changes in bowel habits， such as diarrhea， constipation， rectal bleeding， and dyschezia. When the disease is moderate or se-vere， intestinal symptoms may be present that may differ de-pending on the location and menstrual cycle . The symp-toms of the condition may overlap with those of others， thus delaying diagnosis or treatment. Perianal endometriosis can result from painful vulvar lumps with cyclic swelling that form subcutaneous masses with inner hemorrhaging. Although this condition is rare， patients with a history of lesions in response to the menstrual cycle should be diagnosed with endometrio sis . The presence of endometrial tissue in a perianal site indicates perianal endometriosis. Retrograde menstruation is considered a cause of this condition. During vaginal delivery， feasible endometriotic cells become embedded in the perine-um，including the episiotomy site， which leads to endometriot-ic lacerations. Coelomic metaplasia and transplantation of the exfoliated endometrium may also lead to perianal endometri-osis. Anal endometriosis can be successfully managed laparo-scopically， as it is both safe and effective . Rectal resection improves symptoms but may result in complications such as rectovaginal fistula or anastomotic leakage .Management of the condition remains tentative， necessitating expert man-agement between symptom severity and extended follow-up viability . Some patients show markedly enhanced qual-ity of life after broad surgery. Anal nodules can become de-tached by nodulectomy， segmental resection， mucosal skin-ning， and full-thickness disc resection . Indications forcolorectal resection are currently debated， but statistics sug-gest that hard-line surgery improves patient symptoms. Helpful investigations into endometriosis reported an average time of6.7 years from the commencement of symptoms of endome-triosis to surgical diagnosis . Each affected woman loses many hours of work per week because of reduced effective-ness while working under this debilitative disease. Thus， it is necessary to discover and identify new endometriosis-asso-ciated biomarkers while validating existing biomarkers. This will help in the development of more accurate and noninva-sive methods for the diagnosis of anal endometriosis. In addi-tion， the varying clinical classifications of endometriosis must be considered in the assessment of prognostic and diagnos-tic biomarkers . Several methods to diagnose and imageData could be collected and evaluated across female popu-lations for the phenotypic manifestation of the condition， its symptomatology， and a method found to finely characterize the differences between patients . Well-designed and ad-equately powered controlled trials and long-term studies are also critical for the comparison of different treatment options alongside definite outcome measures. These trials could con-centrate on results that are highly relevant to women， such as quality of life and live birth . Genomics research will also help researchers further comprehend genetic expression in the endometrium of those who have the condition versus controls. Diet is also important in the etiology of the condition； therefore， studies should focus on diet and endometriosis risk to clarify the function of diet in changing the symptoms and underlying disease. The management of perianal endometri-osis includes both surgical and medical treatments. Wide lo-cal excision that spares the anal sphincter can cure the condi-tion， with the addition of hormonal treatment if the sites are multiple . Narrow excision near the edge of the endometri-oma and primary sphincteroplasty can be successfully used to manage these conditions. However， early diagnosis and treat-ment are important to preventing progressive involvement in the surrounding tissues， most notably the anal sphincter， to decrease the risk of postoperative fecal incontinence.\n\n【18】Table 1.

It is an extrapul-monary complication of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis infection. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is a NOS 2A gene polymorphism so that patients are susceptible to tuberculosis spondylitis. This study is an analytical cross-sectional study on 36 Spinal tuberculosis patients at the Wahidin Sudirohusodo Hospital in Makassar who had tested positive TB geneXpert and took five cc of blood samples in EDTA tubes. Then DNA extraction and genotyping examination with PCR techniques were carried out.\n\n【1】There were 39 subjects in this study 39 TB spondylitis patients (84.8%) and seven controls (15.2%). Most of them were women (58.7%)， aged between 20-29 years (41.3%). Based on PCR results， only two subjects experienced a gene mutation(4.3%) in the A-277G single nucleotide. The NOS2A gene polymorphism is a cause of susceptibility to spinal tuberculosis.\n\n【2】KEYWORDS Spinal Tuberculosis， Polymorphism， Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase， NOS 2A\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Tuberculous spondylitis is one of the oldest diseases known to humans. Evidence of infection was found in human vertebral remains from the Iron Age in Europe， and in mummies from South America and ancient Egypt. Even though the first tuber-culous spondylitis case dates back to 2400 BC， the first modern description was made in 1779 by Sir Percival Pott in the Eu-ropean population. Therefore， tuberculous spondylitis is also known as Pott's disease.\n\n【5】One-third of the world population is infected with Mycobac-terium tuberculosis in 2016， although only a small proportion of those infected develop into disease. Approximately 10% ofpatients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis have skeletal involve-ment. The spine is the area most often affected. The prevalence of tuberculous spondylitis in each country is not well defined.\n\n【6】Gene polymorphism is one of the susceptibility factors for tu-berculous spondylitis. In the Chinese population， the association between tuberculous spondylitis infection and Fok-I Polymor-phism in the vitamin D receptor gene indicates that this gene increases susceptibility to tuberculous spondylitis.\n\n【7】Two subjects who experienced gene mutations were all found in tuberculous spondylitis patients， whereas in controls no NOS2A gene mutations were found. (Tabel 4)\n\n【8】The function of nitric oxide (NO) is a vascular regulation， neurotransmission， cytotoxicity， and host defence. NO is formed when the guanido group of essential amino acids L-arginine splits to form NO and L-citrulline. The reaction is catalyzed by a class of enzymes called NO synthases (NOS). Three NOS species were characterized， and their NOS genes were identified. NO is produced constitutively by endothelial (eNOS or NOS3) or neuronal (nNOS or NOS1) synthase， or in higher concentrations by induced synthase (iNOS or NOS2). NOS2 is induced by several cytokines including IFN-g， IL-1b， and TNF-a and byendotoxin in inflammation. Induction of NOS2 produces more NO production and can contribute to the host’s defence against infection by bacteria and parasites.\n\n| Variable  |  | n  | %  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Variable  |  | 39  | 84.8%  |\n| Group  | Tuberculous Spondilitis  | 39  | 84.8%  |\n|  | Control  | 7  | 15.2%  |\n| Age  | <20  |  | 8，7%  |\n|  | 20-29  |  | 413%  |\n|  | 30-39  |  | 23，9%  |\n|  | 40-49  |  | 174%  |\n|  | \\>=50  |  | 8，7%  |\n| Sex  | Male  | 19  | 413%  |\n|  | Female  | 27  | 587%  |\n| PCR Result  | Mutation  | 2  | 4，3%  |\n|  | Non Mutation  | 44  | 95，7%  |\n\n【10】Table 2 The distribution of PCR results based on the sex of the NOS 2A gene mutations\n\n|  | PCR Result  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  | Non  |  |\n| Sex  | Mutation  | Mutation  | Total  |\n| Male  | 0  | 19  | 19  |\n| Female  | 2  | 25  | 27  |\n| Total  | 2  | 44  | 46  |\n\n【12】Table 3 Distribution of PCR results based on the age of the Datient.\n\n|  | PCR Result  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age  | Mutation  | Non Mutation  | Total  |\n| <20  | 0  | 4  | 4  |\n| 20-29  | 0  | 19  | 19  |\n| 30-39  | 0  | 11  | 11  |\n| 40-49  | 1  | 7  | 8  |\n| \\>=50  | 1  | 3  | 4  |\n| Total  | 2  | 44  | 46  |\n\n【14】Table 4 PCR Result and Group Distribution\n\n|  | Group  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Tuberculosis  |  |  |\n| PCRResult  | Spondilitis  | Control  | Total  |\n| Mutation  | 2  | 0  | 2  |\n| Non mutation  | 37  | 7  | 44  |\n| lotal  | 39  | 7  | 46  |\n\n【16】In murine tuberculosis (TB) model， NO plays an essential role in the killing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by mononuclear phagocytes. Intratracheal administration of virulent M. tuber-culosis in mice stimulates the production of NOS2 and NO in alveolar macrophages. The best example of a genetically dis-turbed role where M. tuberculosis infection is associated with a significantly higher risk of spread and mortality compared to other types of infection. \n\n【17】Unlike the murine TB model， there is more considerable con-troversy about the role of NO in killing or limiting M. tuberculo-sis growth in humans. It has been proposed that NO produced by human macrophages infected with TB and by epithelial cells is also antimycobacterial against M. tuberculosis.\n\n【18】Nonetheless， some reports show that alveolar macrophages from TB patients produce an increase in the amount of NO com-pared to healthy control subjects. Wang et al. showed that an increase in NO exhalation in patients with TB was due to the regulation of NOS2A in alveolar macrophages. In contrast to the function of NO which is inferred from mice (as a molecule of my-cobacteria)， it can also participate in the formation of protective granulomasAlthough the expression of NOS2 is usually undetectable in human macrophages from cell lines or macrophages de-rived in vitro from healthy human blood monocytes， alveolarmacrophages and tissue from the lungs of tuberculous patients show a high functional level of NOS2. Polymorphism in the induced nitric oxide synthase gene is associated with tubercu-losis. Also， infected lung tissue from TB patients shows high nitrotyrosine levels， NOS activity products， and increased NOS2activity\n\n【19】NOS2 is encoded by a polymorphic gene known as NOS2A on chromosome 17q11.2-q12. Several single nucleotide poly-morphisms (SNPs) and microsatellites have been described. Apart from some conflicting results， a highly polymorphic pen-tanucleotide (CCTTT) microsatellite located in the promoter region of NOS2A has been indicated to be important function-ally in the NOS2A transcription regulation. The association of microsatellites (CCTTT) has been reported in autoimmune diseases and infections. Also， the polymorphism in the proxi-mal promoter involving the insertion or removal of replicated TAAA units is associated with an increased risk of inflammatory disorders.\n\n【20】NOS2A gene polymorphism is closely related to suscepti-bility to infectious diseases， one of which is TB infection. The background of this study is to examine the effect of NOS2A polymorphism on the risk of developing TB Spondylitis.\n\n【21】Methods\n\n【22】This study is a cross-sectional analytic study on tuberculous spondylitis patients at Wahidin Sudirohusodo Hospital Makas-sar in the period January 2017 to September 2018 where medical data were collected for patients who had tested positive for geneXpert TB as secondary data and conducted interviews for approval of 1 cc blood sample. Furthermore， DNA extraction and genotyping were examined by PCR technique.\n\n【23】Genomic DNA extracted from blood samples using DNA extraction tools. For direct sequencing， PCR was performed to strengthen the promoter region of the NOS2 gene.\n\n【24】Results\n\n【25】From January 2017 to September 2018， there were 39 patients with TB spondylitis who met the criteria (84.8%) and seven controls (15.2%). The majority of TB spondylitis sufferers were women (58.7%)， and most of the patients were aged between20-29 years (41.3%)\n\n【26】Based on the results of PCR examination， only two subjects who experienced gene mutations (4.3%) namely in the NOS 2A gene on A-277G. \n\n【27】The distribution of PCR results based on the sex of the NOS2A gene mutations found were all female and aged 46 and 56vears whereas in the male there was no mutation of the NOS2A gene .\n\n【28】Distribution of PCR results based on the age of the patient found that the mutation of the NOS 2A A-277G gene occurred at intervals of the age of 40-49 years and ages above 50 years.\n\n【29】Discussion\n\n【30】Tuberculous spondylitis is a spine infection disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria， an anaerobic enzyme-producing bacteria，acid-fast， and not content proteolytic which also known as Koch Bacillus (KB) to honour the founder which were a Germany Bacteriologist， Robert Koch. About 10% with tuberculosis has extrapulmonary tuberculosis. The spine wasthe most common infection site of tuberculosis infection in the skeletal area.\n\n【31】Nitric Oxide is free radical acting on several biological func-tions such as signal transducer on low concentration in several physiological functions. On high concentration， nitric oxide acts as a defence mechanism against infective agents and also against tumour， but the exact mechanism is still in research.\n\n【32】The purpose of this research is focused on knowing if there is a gene polymorphism of NOS 2A gene so that the patient is prone to spondylitis TB. From this study， the author found39 subjects of spondylitis TB (84，8%) and seven control(15.2%). Most of the spondylitis TB patients are woman (58，7%) with mean age of 33 +12. Based on the PCR test， only 2 subjects have a gene mutation (4，3%) in gene NOS 2A in A-277G. \n\n【33】This study founded polymorphism in NOS 2A gene in a single nucleotide of A-277 G in 2 samples of a total of 39 samples of subjects diagnosed with Tuberculous Spondylitis.\n\n【34】NOS2 has an essential function in the innate immune system and body immunity function configuration. Killing effect of NO against bacteria have been explained well and seemed very efficient. However， bacteria also have improved in creating arrays of strategies of compressing and limiting function of NOS2A. Despite that NO has a simple structure， it can regulate complex reactions of and creates natural antimicrobial substance， one of them by creating intermediate active nitrogen. \n\n【35】Conclusion\n\n【36】NO2A gene polymorphism in a single nucleotide of A-277Gcan become a reference to state that mutation of the NOS 2A gene causes an individual to be susceptible to Tuberculous Spondylitis infection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Herein， we report 3 rare cases of internal hernia associated with colostomy(IHAC).\n\n【1】Case Reports： The first case involved a 70-year-old man with IHAC after laparoscopic APR. Laparoscopy revealed the small in-testine passed through a defect between the lifted sigmoid colon and left lateral abdominal wall in a cranial-to-caudal direction. The dislocated bowel with ischemic change was restored to its normal position and the lat-eral defect was covered with lateral peritoneum and greater omentum. The second case involved a 75-year-old man with IHAC after laparoscopic APR. Intraperitoneal findings were similar to those in the first case， except for the size of the lateral defect. This defect was too large for primary closure or patching； therefore， no surgical re-pair was performed. Unfortunately， this led to lHAC recurrence and creation of a new colostomy via extraperi-toneal route. The third case involved an 85-year-old man with acute peritonitis resulting from lHAC after lapa-roscopic Hartmann’s operation. Surgery revealed incarcerated bowels forming a closed loop and a perforation in the lifted sigmoid colon. The perforated colon was compressed by the dilated herniated bowel. The resected sigmoid colon showed perforation at the ulcer， which was shown on pathology to be caused by ischemia.\n\n【2】Conclusions： IHAC can lead not only to ischemia of strangulated bowel， but also to secondary damage to the lifted colon.\n\n【3】During laparoscopic Hartmann's operation or APR， the colostomy should be created via extraperitoneal route to avoid IHAC\n\n【4】MeSH Keywords： Colostomy· Hernia， Abdominal· lleus· Laparoscopy· Postoperative ComplicationsAs advanced surgeries have become progressively more common， anus-preserving procedures have become available for patients with rectal malignancy . However， surgical pro cedures with colostomy for rectal malignancy (e.g.， Hartmann's operation \\[HO\\] and abdominoperineal resection \\[APR\\]) are still performed in patients for whom anus-preserving procedures are not indicated \n\n【5】Surgery-related complications associated with colostomy after HO or APR involve stoma stenosis， retraction， or prolapse； para-stomal hernia； and intestinal obstruction . Major causes of postoperative intestinal obstruction are intraperitoneal adhe-sions and unexpected torsion. There have been few reports of intestinal obstruction resulting from internal hernia associated with colostomy (IHAC). We herein present 3 thought-provoking cases of IHAC after laparoscopic surgery for rectal malignancy. We also discuss diagnostic methods and therapeutic strate-gies for this rare complication.\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】Case 1\n\n【8】A 70-year-old man presented with a history of laparoscopic APR for low rectal cancer. A sigmoid colostomy had been cre-ated via the intraperitoneal route during laparoscopic APR. Two months after surgery， the patient experienced severe abdominal pain and visited our hospital. Contrast-enhanced computed to-mography (CE-CT) showed that part of the small intestine and its regional mesentery were positioned in the lateral space be-tween the lifted sigmoid colon and the lateral abdominal wall. A medially displaced and decompressed sigmoid colon was ob-served . The herniated small intestine in the pelvic space was dilated and fluid-filled， but had persistent contrast uptake on the image study . The patient was diag-nosed with strangulation ileus of the small intestine resulting from IHAC. Emergency laparoscopic exploration was performed. Laparoscopy revealed that the small intestine passed through a defect between the lifted sigmoid colon and left lateral ab-dominal wall  in a cranial-to-caudal direction； the herniated bowel formed a closed loop with ischemic changes. This dislocated bowel was restored to a normal position lapa-roscopically. The lateral defect was covered with lateral perito-neum and greater omentum  to avoid postoperative recurrence of IHAC Bowel resection was not required，because the color of the incarcerated small intestine immediately nor-malized. No recurrence of IHAC was observed after surgery.\n\n【9】Laparoscopic surgery was effective for this patient with bowel strangulation resulting from IHAC after laparoscopic APR.\n\n【10】The lateral defect was covered with a patch made from surrounding tissues， which prevented IHAC recurrence.\n\n【11】Case 2\n\n【12】A 75-year-old man presented with a history of laparoscopic APR for rectal melanoma. A sigmoid colostomy had been created via the intraperitoneal route during APR. Two months after APR， the patient experienced moderate abdominal pain and nausea almost simultaneously. The CE-CT findings were sim-ilar to those in Case 1 . A clinical diagnosis of strangulation ileus related to IHAC was made. Emergency lap-aroscopic exploration was performed. Laparoscopy revealed that the small intestine passed through a defect between the lifted sigmoid colon and the left lateral abdominal wall， in a cranial-to-caudal direction. The herniated bowel formed a closed loop； this malposition resulted in partial occlusion of blood flow . The incarcerated bowel was restored to its normal position laparoscopically. Bowel resection was not required， because the herniated small intestine recovered from ischemic changes. The lateral defect was too large for pri-mary closure or patching. The defect measured approximately10 cm by 5 cm was observed based on image and intraoper-ative findings. We therefore chose not to surgically repair this large defect， an intraoperative decision that was， in retrospect， a mistake. As might be expected， IHAC recurred 1 month after initial inadequate herniorrhaphy and repeat laparoscopic sur-gery was needed. During the second surgery for IHAC， the small bowel strangulation was resolved and a new colostomy was made via the extraperitoneal route. After extraperitoneal cre-ation of the colostomy， no recurrence of IHAC was observed.\n\n【13】Leaving IHAC unrepaired is not recommended， because recur-rent IHAC will occur. This case illustrates that surgeons should not hesitate to recreate a colostomy via the extraperitoneal route to prevent recurrence of IHAC.\n\n【14】Case 3\n\n【15】An 83-year-old man presented with a history of laparoscopic HO for low rectal cancer. A sigmoid colostomy had been cre-ated via the intraperitoneal route. Follow-up CE-CT 2 months after surgery showed that the small intestine passed through a defect between the lifted sigmoid colon and left lateral ab-dominal wall， in a cranial-to-caudal direction. The patient was asymptomatic and no disturbance of bowel passage was ob-served . Therefore， we concluded that surgical re-pair was not indicated at that time. Thereafter， the patient re-ceived systemic chemotherapy to treat multiple liver and lung metastases. Fifteen months after HO， the patient developed vomiting and diarrhea during the course of systemic chemo-therapy. CE-CT showed dilation of the fluid-filled small intes-tine， but no obvious small intestinal obstruction was found.\n\n【16】Gastroenteritis resulting from systemic chemotherapy or ad-hesion ileus with incomplete obstruction was suspected. The patient was admitted to our hospital for medical manage-ment and close observation. Two days after hospitalization， the patient's abdominal pain and distention worsened. CE-CT revealed intraperitoneal free air and marked dilation of the small intestine with ascites . A clinical diagnosis of acute peritonitis with digestive tract perforation was made and immediate emergent laparotomy was performed. Surgery revealed that the small intestine passed through a defect be-tween the lifted sigmoid colon and left lateral abdominal wall， in a cranial-to-caudal direction.The incarcerated bowel formed a closed loop and had ischemic color change . The position of the herniated small intestine was normalized. An intestinal perforation was identified in the lifted sigmoid colon，but not in the incarcerated bowel . The perforated colon had been secondarily compressed by the dilated herni-ated bowel. Although the herniated intestine had an ischemic color， this ischemic bowel was preserved after flow restora-tion. The perforated sigmoid colon was resected and a new colostomy was created. The patient's condition was critical because of septic shock and acute peritonitis； therefore，oper-ative time and anesthesia duration were minimized. The new colostomy was made with the descending colon via a conven-tional intraperitoneal route， because colostomy creation via this route is easy and simple. Intraperitoneal lavage was per-formed and 2 surgical drains were placed in the pelvic cavity. Although the postoperative course was complicated by para-lytic ileus and pneumonia， the patient was discharged 26 days after surgery. The resected bowel showed a perforation at theIHAC easily leads to ischemic damage of incarcerated smallin-testine. Moreover， IHAC can affect the lifted colon. Perforation of the lifted colon and subsequent peritonitis are clinically se-rious and require emergency surgery. Accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment are crucial for IHAC. A colostomy should be intentionally created via the extraperitoneal route at initial surgery to avoid IHAC\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】Surgical procedures with concurrent colostomy creation (e.g.， HO or APR) are still performed worldwide for patients withrectal malignancies. Stoma stenosis， retraction， or prolapse； parastomal hernia； and intestinal obstruction are the main re-ported surgery-related complications. The major cause of in-testinal obstruction is postoperative intraperitoneal adhesions； intestinal obstruction resulting from internal hernia is a rare clinical complication. Almost all reported postoperative internal hemias were caused by mesenteric defects after gastrointestinal tract or colorectal surgery . A mesenteric internal hernia often results in intestinal obstruction， which requires subse-quent surgical treatment. Surgical closure of mesenteric de-fects during initial surgery is recommended to avoid mesen-teric internal hernias. However， IHAC is considered extremely rare， with only 2 documented case reports .\n\n【19】Laparoscopic surgery has developed markedly in recent years and is now widely performed， especially in general surgery.\n\n【20】Laparoscopic surgery has many advantages compared with open surgery， including better cosmesis， less postoperative pain， earlier postoperative recovery，and fewer intraperitoneal adhesions . Intraperitoneal adhesions often cause postop erative intestinal obstruction. Laparoscopic surgery results in fewer cases of postoperative intestinal obstruction compared with open surgery. Paradoxically， intraperitoneal adhesions may prevent intestinal herniation； we therefore speculate that laparoscopic surgery may have the disadvantage of increasing the likelihood of internal hernias compared with open surgery. Although over 1200 cases of colorectal surgery and more than200 cases of sigmoid colostomy have been performed in the past 10 years at our institute， only 3 cases of IHACs occurred. During this period， laparoscopic colostomy creation was em-ployed via the intraperitoneal route in all cases because lap-aroscopic colostomy creation via the extraperitoneal involves technical difficulty， especially in the launching stage of laparo-scopic surgery. In contrast， conventional open surgery was per-formed via both routes (i.e.， intra- and extraperitoneal routes). The incidences of IHAC in open and laparoscopic colostomy creations were evaluated， and the incidence rate of IHAC wasapproximately 1.5%. Note that all IHACs were observed not in conventional open surgery but， rather in laparoscopic colostomy creation. Conventional open surgery easily causes postoperative adhesions in the intra-abdominal cavity， but intraperitoneal ad-hesions after laparoscopic surgery are less common than after open surgery. The incidence of IHAC is very low， and our expe-riences with these 3 cases may involve a bias. In our results，all IHAC cases happened after laparoscopic surgery (not after con-ventional open surgery)， and all IHAC were diagnosed in the early postoperative period (i.e.， within 2 months after laparoscopic surgery). One possible explanation for our results is that less intraperitoneal adhesion after laparoscopic surgery resulted in IHAC， even in the early postoperative period， because underthe non-adherent conditions in the intra-abdominal cavity， digestive tracts can anytime enter into anywhere. Hence， in the era of laparoscopic surgery， we strongly recommend that a colostomy under laparoscopic surgery should be created via the extraper-itoneal route to prevent IHAC. With the further development of laparoscopic surgery， the incidence of internal hernias may in-crease. Adequate management of internal hernias is required and preventive strategies for IHAC should be established.\n\n【21】Internal hernias are often difficult to diagnose； imaging plays an important role in diagnosis. The most useful examination for diagnosing internal hernia is CE-CT . Our experience indicates that the following 2 findings on CE-CT are important in diagnosing IHAC： (i) positioning of the small intestine and its regional mesentery in the lateral space between the lifted sigmoid colon and left lateral abdominal wall， and (ii) medial displacement and decompression of the sigmoid colon. We be-lieve that these findings support a precise diagnosis of IHAC\n\n【22】Intra- and extraperitoneal routes are available for colostomy creation. Both routes are used worldwide  and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. The intraperitoneal route has the advantage of simplicity； therefore， this conven-tional route is preferred by many surgeons and is performed worldwide during HO and APR. With the intraperitoneal route， the small intestine can pass through the lateral defect， and IHAC may result in strangulation ileus and severe ischemia. Thus， the intraperitoneal route has the inherent possibility of resulting in IHAC， and we have no complete solution to pre-vent IHAC in cases via the intraperitoneal route. Hence， we strongly recommend that a laparoscopic colostomy should be created via the extraperitoneal route， even though the lapa-roscopic approach is accompanied with technical difficulties. In contrast， in the extraperitoneal route there is no space be-tween the lifted sigmoid colon and the dissected lateral ab-dominal wall. Therefore， IHAC should in theory not occur， although cases have been reported even with this route . The extraperitoneal route requires additional techniques (e.g.， additional dissection of the extraperitoneal space and mobi-lization of the left-sided colon). Previous reports have docu-mented that the extraperitoneal route was associated with alower incidence of parastomal hernias compared with the in-traperitoneal route； the risks of other complications were sim-ilar for both routes .\n\n【23】Though parastomal hernia is a common complication after co-lostomy ，intraperitoneal internal hernia and parastomal hernia are different. We here focused on a rare complication(i.e.， IHAC). At our institution， we performed sigmoid colostomy via the intraperitoneal route until we experienced these three cases. Currently， we employ an extraperitoneal route for colos-tomy creation to avoid IHAC. Our technical solution for not only IHAC but also parastomal hernia are summarized in schema. Colostomy is created via an extraperitoneal route to prevent IHAC even in fewer adhesions by laparoscopic sur-gery， and via staggered fascia incisions to avoid the most com-mon complication (i.e.， parastomal hernia) .\n\n【24】At our institution， we performed sigmoid colostomy via the intraperitoneal route until we experienced these 3 cases. Currently， we use an extraperitoneal route for colostomy cre-ation to avoid IHAC. IHAC can lead not only to ischemia of the strangulated bowel， but also to secondary damage to the lifted colon. The small bowel is likely to repeat torsion and/or incarceration once the IHAC occurs. We strongly recommend creating a new colostomy via the extraperitoneal route in pa-tients who once experienced IHAC and who received no clo-sure or patch of the lateral defect (similar to the patient in Case 2). Severe damage to the lifted colon will cause a critical situation. As described above， we fear that the incidence of internal hernias may increase in the era of laparoscopic sur-gery and we recommend that even subtle defects should be carefully closed. We believe that the extraperitoneal route is superior to the intraperitoneal route for colostomy creation to avoid unexpected IHAC， and that no defects should remain after laparoscopic surgery.\n\n【25】Conclusions\n\n【26】During laparoscopic HO or ARP， a colostomy should be inten-tionally created via an extraperitoneal route to avoid IHAC. Careful closure of even subtle defects is important in the era of laparoscopic surgery.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Effective anticoagulation therapy may play a dominant role in the management of severe COVID-19 cases.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】A 73-year-old man with a 6-day history of fever up to 38.5℃， dyspnea， cough， and fatigue was diagnosed with COVID-19. He had a past medical history significant for hypertension and coronary artery bypass grafting. Two days after hospital admission， the patient developed acute respiratory failure， requiring intubation， mechanical ventilation， and transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU). He received treatment including antibiotics， hydroxy-chloroquine， tocilizumab， vasopressors， prone positioning， and anticoagulation with enoxaparin at a prophylac-tic dose. After a 15-day ICU stay， the patient was hemodynamically stable but still hypoxemic； a transthorac-ic echocardiogram at that time， followed by a transesophageal echocardiogram for better evaluation， revealed the presence of a right atrium thrombus without signs of acute right ventricular dilatation and impaired sys-tolic function. Since the patient was hemodynamically stable， we decided to treat him with conventional an-ticoagulation under close monitoring for signs of hemodynamic deterioration； thus， the prophylactic dose of enoxaparin was replaced by therapeutic dosing， which was a key component of the patient's successful out-come. Over the next few days he showed significant clinical improvement. The follow-up transesophageal echo-cardiogram 3 weeks after effective therapeutic anticoagulation revealed no signs of right heart thrombus. The presented COVID-19 case， one of the first reported cases with evidence of right heart thrombus by trans-esophageal echocardiography highlights the central role of diagnostic imaging strategies and the importance of adequate anticoagulation therapy in the management of severe COVID-19 cases in the ICU.\n\n【5】MeSH Keywords： Anticoagulants· COVID-19·Echocardiography·Thrombosis\n\n【6】The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV2). The World Health Organization has recently declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of internation-al concern. Patients with older age and comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease are at higher risk for severe disease. Common laboratory abnormalities found in patients with COVID-19 include lymphopenia and elevation in lactate dehy-drogenase (LDH) and inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP)， D-dimers， ferritin， and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Older age， higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score， and elevated D-dimers at hospital admission are risk factors for death . Data analysis of the clinical characteristics of1099 Chinese patients with confirmed COVID-19 showed that5% of patients required Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission，2.3% underwent invasive mechanical ventilation and 1.4%died . COVID-19 may predispose patients to thrombotic dis-ease in both venous and arterial circulations because of ex-cessive inflammation， hypoxia， platelet activation， endotheli-al dysfunction， and stasis .\n\n【7】Recent studies underline the importance of venous thromboem-bolic events in severe COVID-19 patients. The reported incidence of thrombotic complications in patients with COVID-19 requir-ing ICU admission is high， ranging from 20.6% to 31%. It is notable that at least half of thromboembolic events were diagnosed within the first 24 h of admission， and thus were not preventable by the initial in-hospital thromboprophylac-tic anticoagulation . In addition， the low number of as-sociated deep venous thromboses in COVID-19 patients may suggest the presence of pulmonary thrombosis rather than embolism .\n\n【8】We report our experience to highlight the crucial role of effi-cient anticoagulation therapy in the management of severe COVID-19 cases requiring ICU admission； the importance of di-agnostic imaging strategies， including transesophageal echo-cardiography， is also emphasized.\n\n【9】Case Report\n\n【10】A 73-year-old man presented to the emergency room after 6days of fever up to 38.5C， dyspnea， cough with some yellow-ish sputum， and fatigue. The physical examination showed re-spiratory rate 30/min， arterial oxygen saturation 91% on 3 L of supplemental oxygen， blood pressure 125/75 mmHg， heart rate 88/min， and chest auscultation revealed bilateral coarse crackles in the lungs. No leg swelling or signs of deep venous thrombosis were present.\n\n【11】His past medical history included hypertension and coronary artery bypass grafting 2 years earlier； he was receiving com-bination therapy for hypertension， and acetylsalicylic acid100 mg/day. He had no known personal or family history of hypercoagulability.\n\n【12】The computed tomography of the lungs showed bilateral multi-focal ground-glass opacities. No lower-extremity venous ultra-sound was performed. The white blood cell count was 13 800/uL(lymphocyte count 1104/uL， 8%)， whereas all markers of in-fection were increased (ferritin 2760 ng/mL， CRP 276 mg/L， procalcitonin 1.68 ug/L， D-dimers 2098 ng/mL，LDH 392 U/L). The differential diagnosis included community-acquired pneu-monia， atypical pneumonia，and COVID-19.\n\n【13】The patient was initially treated with azithromycin 500 mg in-travenously (V) once daily and ampicillin/sulbactam 3 gr Ⅳ，3 times daily. Prophylactic dose for thromboembolism with enoxaparin was also initiated， and therapy with acetylsalicyl-ic acid was maintained. After the testing for SARS-CoV-2 infec-tion by real-time polymerase chain reaction by nasopharyngeal swab， which came out positive the next day， hydroxychloro-quine was added to his therapy according to our hospital pro-tocol， with 400 mg twice daily on the first day and 200 mg 3times daily for the next 5 days.\n\n【14】Nevertheless， the patient's condition rapidly deteriorated， and he required intubation and mechanical ventilation 2 days after hospital admission； at that time， a central line into the right internal jugular vein was also inserted. Thereafter， he was ad-mitted to the ICU for further management； his SOFA score at ICU admission was 8.\n\n【15】During the next few days， the patient was febrile，hypoxemic， and hemodynamically unstable， requiring vasopressors； he received tocilizumab (IL-6 inhibitor) and antibiotics including ceftaroline， meropenem， colistin， and linezolid. He was treat-ed for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome， including prone positioning for 3 days， with beneficial effects. He con-tinued to receive enoxaparin at prophylactic dose for throm-boembolism and acetylsalicylic acid； no other treatment mo-dalities for immobilization were applied.\n\n【16】Two weeks after the ICU admission， the patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable， but still hypoxemic with a PaO，/FiO，ratio of 122 mmHg， requiring continuation of mechanical ventilation. At that time a transthoracic echocardiogram， fol-lowed by a transesophageal echocardiogram for better eval-uation， revealed the presence of a right atrium thrombus without signs of acute right ventricular dilatation and impaired systolic function； a pulmonary embolism (PE) might also have occurred. Since the patient was hemodynamically stable and the levels of cardiac troponin T were not elevated(12 pg/mL)， we decided to treat him with conventional anti-coagulation， consisting of an increased dose of enoxaparin，80 mg subcutaneously (SC) twice daily， to attain therapeutic anti-Xa levels (0.8-1.2 U/mL). In addition， the patient was un-der close monitoring for signs of hemodynamic deterioration or massive PE； initiation of systemic thrombolysis would im-mediately follow in this scenario. On the basis of the above-mentioned anticoagulation treatment and related monitoring， we chose not to transfer the patient to radiology for PE as-sessment. No other tests for genetic or acquired hypercoagu-lable states were done at that time. During the next few days the patient had significant clinical improvement； the follow-up transesophageal echocardiogram 3 weeks after effective therapeutic anticoagulation revealed no signs of right heart thrombus . The patient remained hemodynamically stable， maintaining a PaO /FiO， ratio of 290 mmHg， without need of mechanical ventilation. He was in a process of trache-ostomy closure and ICU discharge to a rehabilitation facility.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】Recent data have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection and the associated systemic inflammatory storm in severe cases re-sults in endothelial dysfunction and activation of the coagu-lation cascade. There is an ongoing discussion regarding the effectiveness of routine prophylactic anticoagulation therapy in preventing thrombotic complications in severe COVID-19cases .\n\n【19】The presence of the right atrium thrombus in our patient， who was already in prophylactic anticoagulation therapy， gener-ates some questions. How long was the thrombus in the right atrium? Could it be related to the coagulation dysfunction ob-served in COVID-19， as part of the initial presentation? Couldit be associated with the stasis， hemodynamic instability， me-chanical ventilation， or central line placement during the ICU stay? Is the therapeutic coagulation after the thrombus diag-nosis a crucial therapeutic intervention for the final outcome of the patient? Finally， what is the appropriate initial anticoag ulation therapy for severe COVID-19 cases admitted in the ICU?\n\n【20】As the computed tomography of the lungs at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis was without contrast， we do not have in-formation regarding the presence of the right heart throm-bus or even pulmonary embolism at ICU admission. However， we do know that after the change of prophylactic anticoagu-lation to therapeutic dosing， the transesophageal echocardio-gram revealed no signs of residual right atrium thrombus and the patient had continuous significant improvement in both hemodynamics and oxygenation.\n\n【21】We should emphasize the critical role of transesophageal echo-cardiography in the management of the patient by providing reliable and safe information. The detection of intracardiac thrombus or clot in transit by transthoracic and transesoph-ageal echocardiography， and the subsequent therapeutic in-terventions， have been recently reported in a few cases with severe COVID-19J.Currently，transesophageal echocar-diography is strongly endorsed by experts as an invaluable tool for managing critically ill patients with COVID-19 .\n\n【22】Since we are at the beginning of studying COVID-19 compli-cations， we cannot have sufficient answers to questions aris-ing from the challenges and management issues of severe COVID-19 cases. However， it seems that thromboembolic com-plications are common in patients with severe COVID-19 re-quiring ICU care， and low-molecular-weight heparins may be preferred in patients unlikely to need procedures. The opti-mal initial dose remains unknown； some physicians considerthat prophylactic anticoagulation is needed， whereas others think that therapeutic anticoagulation is reasonably neces-sary .\n\n【23】Conclusions\n\n【24】The presented COVID-19 case， one of first to provide evidence of right heart thrombus by transesophageal echocardiogra-phy， highlights the central role of diagnostic imaging strate-gies and the importance of adequate anticoagulation therapy in the management of severe COVID-19 cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

She was initially started on hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate， followed by addition of adalimumab for active RA symptoms in late 2007 after dis-cussing with proctologyShe was diagnosed with infiltrating adenocarcinoma of the recto-sigmoid s/p surgery in 1996， followed by chemoradia-tion and adjuvant chemotherapy completed in 1997. The pa-tient had family history significant for cancer in many first-de gree relatives. Her mother died from colon cancer at age 39and her father died of lymphoma at age 64， her brother had colon cancer at age 32， a maternal cousin had colon cancer at age 62， a maternal uncle died of colon cancer at age 75， a maternal cousin died of pancreatic cancer， and 2 sisters have colon polyps requiring yearly colonoscopy.\n\n【10】In 2006， a colonoscopy showed a 3-cm flat mass lesion at the proximal transverse colon. Pathology revealed infiltrating ad-enocarcinoma for which she underwent right hemi-colectomy. She had subsequent follow-up colonoscopies. Following her surgery in 2006 periodic testing every 2-3 years has shown negative results for any tumor recurrence. In 2009 the patient underwent genetic testing and was diagnosed with HNPCC mutation，MLH1 suspected deleterious mutation： IVS17-2A>C\n\n【11】Given the diagnosis of HNPCC mutation， the patient was re-ferred for prophylactic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in 2010. Surgical pathology analysis surpris-ingly revealed endometrioid adenocarcinoma FIGO grade 2pTla， Nx， Mx. Adalimumab and methotrexate were stoppedfor the surgery and then discontinued after the pathology re-sults were known.Methotrexate was resumed after 6 months for active RA. Medrol was also added for better control of rheu-matoid manifestations.\n\n【12】Screening mammography in October 2012 was negative. In December 2013， mammography showed suspicious lesion in the outer part of the right breast with calcifications， BIRADS4. Biopsy results showed intra-ductal carcinoma，estrogen re-ceptor positive and progesterone receptor negative. The pa-tient underwent right breast lumpectomy. Pathological analy-sis revealed solid grade 3 ductal carcinoma in situ.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Lynch syndrome was first described by Dr. Henry Lynch as an aggregation of colorectal and endometrial cancers inherited in an autosomal dominant manner . Germline mutations of MMR genes cause susceptibility to a hereditary form of colon cancer， hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) . The diagnosis of LS can be made on the basis of family history in those families meeting the Amsterdam criteria who have tu-mor microsatellite instability (MSI). Alternatively， the diagno-sis can be made on the basis of molecular genetic testing in an individual or family with a germline mutation in 1 of 4 mis-match repair (MMR) genes (MLH1， MSH2， MSH6， and PMS2). MLH1 and MSH2 germline mutations， which account for ap-proximately 90% of pathogenic variants in families with LS； MSH6 pathogenic variants in about 7-10%； and PMS2 patho-genic variants in fewer than 5%. Germline deletions in EPCAM(not a mismatch repair gene) inactivate MSH2 in about 1% of individuals with Lynch syndrome .\n\n【15】Patients with Lynch syndrome are also at risk for a number of extra-colonic malignancies . Among women， endometri-al cancer is the second most common cancer associated with the LS， with an estimated lifetime risk of 40-60%4，10J.Other associated malignancies of stomach，pancreato-biliary system， and small bowel have been described .\n\n【16】Rheumatoid arthritis is systemic autoimmune disorder in which chronic inflammation may lead to joint destruction and dis-ability. Early recognition and aggressive management are criti-cal to control inflammation， reduce damage， and improve out-comes. Increased risk of malignancies， especially lymphoid malignancies， have been described in patients with autoim-mune diseases like RA， systemic lupus erythematosus， and Sjogren's syndrome . Findings in a recent cohort study whose subjects included 29 patients with RA-associated lym-phoma provide further indirect evidence suggesting that in-flammatory activity may be a driving force in lymphoma devel-opment . Epidemiological studies have demonstrated thathematopoietic， lung， skin， and prostate cancers are increased in RA， while breast and colon cancers are decreased， with an overall slight increase in all cancers .\n\n【17】Evaluating the risk of cancer in RA patients is a 2-step process because patients are subject to increased risk of cancer due to the pathophysiology of the disease itself and some possi-ble treatment options.\n\n【18】With relation to RA treatment options， effectively decreasing systemic inflammation may in fact reduce the risk for cancer， but treatment of RA using the newer biologic agents like in-fliximab or adalimumab has been associated with increased risk of malignancy， specifically lymphoma .\n\n【19】The rationale behind discontinuing use of biologic therapy in our patient for her RA was based upon evidence showing in-creased risk of malignancy with such therapy. Therefore， for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis-with thought to minimizing the risk of cancer-we would recommend traditional DMARDs such as methotrexate and leflunomide， because they are notassociated with increased risk of malignancy. However， there are no current guidelines about the use of biologic agents in the presence of active underlying malignancy . For this reason，the therapeutic treatment of RA in the presence of LS is a challenge in which the malignancy risk factor needs to be weighed against controlling RA based on the clinical disease management as well as the patient's personal healthcare and comfort priorities.\n\n【20】Conclusions\n\n【21】We describe a patient with LS and RA presenting a therapeu-tic challenge because biologic agents commonly used to treat severe RA need to be used cautiously in patients with histo-ry of malignancy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "69a7b6f4-81ac-4a37-a276-2fbd407c7a9e", "title": null, "text": "【0】ABSTRACT Background： Trauma affecting mid-face often leads to lesions of soft tissues， teeth and bone， damaging the integrity of the orbital skeletons， and is frequently complicated by ophthalmic injury. Careful injury assessment and its complications are essential to make an optimal treatment decision. The aim of this paper is to present a case of mid-facial fracture with a brief review of the risk of ophthalmic injury and its surgical management preferred by the authors. Case Report：A 19 year-old man was brought to the emergency room with swelling and multiple wounds at facial region after he was involved in a motorcycle accident 30 minutes earlier. Primary survey performed according to Advanced Trauma Live Support (ATLS) showed no live threatening condition. There was asymmetrical face with edema at left cheek and eye. We found no wound intra-orally and teeth occlusion was not possible. After careful physical examinations， we assessed his condition with the following injuries： mid-facial fracture with suspect muscle entrapment of his left eyeball. Laboratory and radiographic imaging were taken to support the diagnostic. The surgical reposition and fixation of the fracture were performed under general anesthesia by an oral maxillofacial surgeon and an ophthalmologist. Reduction using interdental wiring and fixation using plate and screw at facial buttress successfully returned the patient facial contour to its former condition and occlusion was achieved. A catheter balloon was inserted to his left maxillary sinus to obtain normal sinus volume and hold his eyeball to its position. Then the patient was followed up at 1 day， 1 week， and 1 month. Discussion： Treatment of mid-facial fracture focuses on reductions to achieve exact orbital rim alignment， preserve ophthalmic function and normal dental occlusion. Immobilization of fracture requires various combinations of interdental wiring， inter-maxillary fixation， and open reduction with internal fixation. Conclusion： Dealing with mid-facial fracture needs a sharp investigation to produce proper diagnosis. Ophthalmic injury is one of the common injuries accompanying mid-facial injury. Early surgical treatment is preferred to reduce risk of irreversible globe injury and maximizes the functional and cosmetic results.\n\n【1】Socioeconomic， culture， alcohol consumption， and awareness of traffic regulation lead to a variety of maxillofacial trauma incidences in different regions of the world. According to some studies in the developed countries， assault is the leading cause of facial fractures followed by motor vehicle accidents(MVAs)， pedestrian collisions， stumbling， sports and industrial accidents but the leading cause shifts to road traffic accidents inunderdeveloped or developing areas of the world followed by assaults and other reasons， including warfare.Trauma is the leading cause of deaths occurred in the first 40 years of life， and it is well known that MF injuries are frequently seen in poly-trauma victims， damaging the integrity of the orbital skeleton and are frequently complicated by ophthalmic injury.MF region includes organs executing essential functions of the body like respiration， speech， mastication， vision and smell. Therefore special attention must be paid in the case of facial trauma.\n\n【2】Lesions of teeth commonly accompany the trauma of the mid-face， soft tissue and bony structures of the skull including the zy-gomatic bone， the maxilla， the naso-ethmoid (NOE) complex and naso-orbital as well as supraorbital structures. Not rarely， those lesions on the mid-face area combined with injuries of other parts of the body. Ophthalmic complications vary from minor injuries， such as subconjunctival bleeds and hematomas， to major injuries， such as blow out of the globe or nerve injury， exophthalmos， enophthalmos， restriction of eye movements， traumatic neuropathy， eyelid injuries， lacrimal muscle injuries， and duct injuries. Patients with mid-facial fracture who do not undergo successful or appropriate treatment may suffer from significant long-term consequences such as disfiguring scars， bony deformities， and even loss of vision.\n\n【3】Injuries of the lateral mid-face occur more frequently than of central mid-face. Males are affected more often than females. There is a peak age in the 2nd and 3rd decade of life. Street accidents occur more often than sports accidents. Independent from the severity and the fracture type， the basis for successful therapy of mid-facial fracture is the restoration of the supporting pillar of the mid-face， the bony prominences， the bone cavities(e.g. orbit) and correct occlusionThe mid-face consists of the following bony structures： nasal bones， lacrimal bone， ethmoid， sphenoid， maxilla， zygomatic bone， and palatine bone. The sites where vessels and nerves emerge are of major importance in traumatology， as they pose structural weak points that influence fracture lines. In the area of the anterior skull base， the following foramina are concerned：\n\n【4】· The foramina of the cribriform plate where the olfactory fibres emerge.\n\n【5】·TThe pathway of the anterior and posterior ethmoid arteries.· The optic canal.\n\n【6】·The superior orbital fissure with the nerve responsible for oculomotor functions， that however plays only a direct role in extreme injuries.\n\n【7】· The infra- and supraorbital foramen with its respective portions of the trigeminal nerve. Fractures affecting those foramina indicate surgery based on clinically apparent hyp-or anaesthesia.\n\n【8】Diagnosis and management of facial injury are a challenge， particularly in the setting of coexisting polytrauma in the emer-gency department. As with any initial evaluation， the great-est priority is the primary survey， which consists of the ABCs(airway， breathing， and circulation). Once these are secured， a detailed history of the event should be ascertained from the patient， witnesses， or first responders. To correctly diagnose a fracture， a careful examination of the patient has to be performed together with an assessment of the history of the accident.\n\n【9】Examination of the patient's occlusion is vital and should be done in a neutral position. Ask the patient to open and close his jaw， and then clench the jaw and see if there is any sensationof the bite being “off\". A CT scan offers distinct advantages over other imaging modalities. The size and morphology of the fracture can be determined， which aids in not only clinical assessment but also surgical planning. A CT scan can also help detect entrapment of the orbital rectus muscles， recognized by displacement of the muscle into the fracture site， with or without bone displacement.\n\n【10】Zygoma fractures are mostly seen in young male patients whose lifestyle are at high risk for trauma. Diagnosis of com-plex zygomatic fractures is usually clinical， with radiographic confirmation. Fractures of the zygomatic bone complex are rather frequent because of the prominence of the zygomatic bone. Fracture line passed through the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus and in general through the infraorbital foramen to the zygomatico-alveolar crest. From there， the fracture line reaches the inferior orbital fissure cranial to the lateral and posterior wall of the maxillary sinus. The orbital floor is nearly always affected in cases of fracture of the zygomatic bone. After an impact of high violence， also a comminuted fracture of the zygomatic com-plex may result and part of the zygomatic bone may dislocate into the maxillary sinus. Concomitant injuries of the zygomatic complex often affect the ocular globe and optic nerve.\n\n【11】For mid-facial fracture， the fracture should be treated within the first two weeks. If not treated within these two weeks， the beginning of bone absorption at the fragment surfaces and the beginning of callus formation will lead to difficulty in reposi-tioning to its anatomically correct position. After an interval of2 weeks， the treatment is considered as delayed and is based on the principle of secondary post-traumatic treatment. Primary care for fracture should be performed as soon as the general condition of the patient allows therapy to be done. The limiting factor for immediate treatment of the fracture is mostly not the fracture itself but the patient’s general condition.\n\n【12】Sagittal fractures of the maxilla or palate， either in the midline or paramedian region， often resulting in oronasal communica-tion. Early stabilization of these fractures prevents the functional impairments and life-threatening situations， such as continuous hemorrhage from the traumatized nasal mucosa and nasal re-gurgitation of food leading to the risk of aspiration.\n\n【13】The morphogenesis of mid-facial processes requires the co-ordination of a variety of cellular functions of both mesenchy-mal and epithelial cells to develop complex structures. The palatal bone is thicker anteriorly and progressively thins as the soft palate is approache SOftPd. Ignoring the crest at the midline， the hard palate is relatively thin in the sagittal and parasagittal re-gions but becomes progressively thicker towards the alveolus. At the alveolus， the thicknesses of the palatal bone are 12 to 14mm. The average thickness of the palatal platform， however， is4.5 mm. The medial wall of orbital rim comprises the frontal process of the maxilla， the lacrimal bone， the orbital plate of the ethmoid bone， and the sphenoid body. The area damaged most easily by trauma is the very thin lamina papyracea (0.2-0.4mm thick)， which separates the orbit from the ethmoidal sinuses. The lacrimal sac lies anteriorly along the medial wall in the lacrimal groove formed by the maxilla and lacrimal bones.\n\n【14】Direct trauma of face can involve the medial wall of the or-bital rim， but the orbital floor is involved more commonly. The cause of this type of fracture is thought to be from increased intraorbital pressure， which causes the orbital bones to break at their weakest point.\n\n【15】Fracture morphology in the central mid-face is documented by fragmentation， displacement， and bone loss. The number offracture lines determines the fragmentation within the partitions as 0 = nonfragmented (single straight or twisted fracture line) or1 = fragmented (more than a single fracture line). So-called mul-tifragmentary or， in outmoded parlance， comminuted fractures， representing fractures in which bone is shattered， splintered or crushed into many pieces， are included in the latter category. Displacement is attested whenever the fragments have moved out of their original location and lack alignment to the skeletal superstructure regardless of the metric amount. Traumatic bone loss， also referred to as bone defect， applies to deficits ranging from small fragments to large sections. Without distinction of the potential spectrum of the deficit， it is either negated (0=no bone loss) or affirmed (1=boneloss).\n\n【16】The zygoma and its anatomical sub-regions constitute the lateral mid-face attached to each side of the maxillary portions of the central mid-face pyramid in the transition to the greater sphenoid wing， the frontal bone， and the temporal bone. Five articulations extending from the body of the zygoma connect to the adjacent bones： \n\n【17】·Frontal process or lateral orbital rim\n\n【18】·Zygomaticomaxillary buttress or zygomaticomaxillary crest\n\n【19】· Inferior orbital process of the zygoma\n\n【20】·Lateral orbital process (facies orbitalis or zygomaticosphe-noid flange) of the zygoma (anterior portion of the lateral orbital wall)\n\n【21】· Temporal process is continuous with the zygomatic arch.\n\n【22】Fractures of the orbital floor occur either in the context of fractures of the zygomatic bone complex and other mid-facial fractures or as isolated findings. Clinical symptoms of orbital fractures are hyposphagma，epistaxis， sensitivity disturbances in the area of the infraorbital nerve， enophthalmos，hypophthal-mus， diplopia， disturbed eye motility， rounded canthus (cow’s eye) in case of ruptured canthal ligament.\n\n【23】The periorbita and the bony orbital floor together comprise the orbital floor complex. Herniation of the peri-orbital tissue， fat， the inferior rectus muscle， and the periorbita also leads to the clinical signs of motility disorders， diplopia， and enophthal-mosAn ophthalmic examination is an indispensable part of the clinical examination after maxillofacial trauma. Whenever com-munication is possible with the patient， a clinical evaluation is mandatory. In nonresponsive patients， it is challenging to evaluate visual acuity. Pupillary reaction to light is often the only parameter. Oedema and hematoma compromise correct evaluation of proptosis or enophthalmos.\n\n【24】The fracturing of the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus is often included in a zygomaticomaxillary complex (ZMC) frac-ture； an isolated anterior wall of the maxillary sinus fractures account for 1.3% of facial bone fractures. The most common indication for surgery in ZMC fractures is displacement and ro-tation. Three-dimensional displacement usually occurs in ZMC fracture， meaning that malar eminence can be displaced into medial-lateral， superior-inferior， and anterior-posterior direc-tions. Most surgeons agree that conservative treatment of ZMC fractures is appropriate in situations with no displace-ment of the fracture segments.\n\n【25】The individual approach depends on the underlying fracture：a transoral approach， transconjunctival incisions， an intranasal approach， or transcutaneous approaches may be appropriate. The access is chosen for optimal overview to facilitate reposition and osteosynthesis. At the same time， the incisions should be performed in an esthetically discreet way. Reductionshould be performed for displaced fractures that result in tris-mus， contour asymmetry， or significant orbital floor disruption. The zygomaticomaxillary buttress can be accessed through a gingivobuccal sulcus incision.\n\n【26】There is no standard treatment for ophthalmic injuries fol-lowing mid-facial trauma.  The surgical access to the orbital floor is usually performed in a transconjunctival or transfacial way in the area of the lower eyelid. Using this incision， a good exposition with the possibility of extension and favourable post-operative scarring is possible. The most frequently used access is performed via the oral vestibule.\n\n【27】It is unclear which tissue types (peri-orbital content such as fat， septa， periosteum， or muscle) are responsible for late motil-ity disorders， and it should be specified whether the inferior rectus muscle or the inferior oblique muscle contributes most to motility limitations.\n\n【28】At the junction of the medial wall and orbital roof are the anterior and posterior ethmoidal foramina in which the ante-rior and posterior ethmoidal arteries and nerves course from the orbit to the anterior cranial fossa. These structures can be injured directly at the time of trauma， awareness of this location during repair helps prevent intraoperative bleeding. The sur-gical reposition of fractures and osteosynthesis of patients with midfacial fractures is typically performed under general anaes-thesia. Generally， the bone fragments should be repositioned in their anatomically correct position and secured safely. The objective is the reconstruction of the shape and function of all structures of the mid-face， as atraumatic as possible. The recon-struction of the correct occlusion is one of the most important objectives of surgical treatment of mid-facial fractures affecting the teeth-bearing parts of the mid-face.\n\n【29】Surgical treatment of an isolated anterior wall of the maxil-lary sinus fracture is open reduction and internal fixation. Large fragments can be fixed with plates and screws， and small frag-ments can either be positioned at the bony defect or removed. When the defect cannot be covered by using bony fragments， another method is to restore using titanium meshes and other resorbable materials.\n\n【30】The medial rectus muscle is one of the most important anatomical structures which are intimately related to the medial wall. One of the most obvious signs of medial orbit wall fracture is a motility disturbance， usually adduction or abduction， caused by damage to or entrapment of the medial rectus. Other signif-icant， medially located structures that must be accounted for in medial orbit wall trauma include the medial canthal tendon， trochlea， and lacrimal drainage system.\n\n【31】Intermaxillary fixation (IMF) may be maintained if instability of other fractures of the craniofacial skeleton requires it. Mo-tion and soft diet are permitted in the immediate postoperative period. The locking plate(s) and screw(s) assembly is readily removed some 8 to 12 weeks after its application， under local or general anesthesiaThe patient should be instructed on the care for IMF and proper oral hygiene and placed on a full liquid， followed by a soft diet until the IMF is removed. Rigid IMF is to be removed within 3 to 4 weeks and transitioned to elastic IMF. The occlu-sion must be assessed at each follow-up appointment. After six weeks， the IMF may be removed，provided preinjury occlusion is achieved.\n\n【32】Postoperative infection is rare in maxillary fractures com-pared with mandibular fractures. Infections are more likely to occur in the setting of maxillary sinus obstruction and pre-existing sinus disease. A nasal-antral window may be used if the maxillary sinuses are obstructed. Prophylactic antibiotics should be used as indicated. Chlorhexidine mouthwashes should be used and analgesics prescribed as necessary.\n\n【33】Any orbital surgery carries with it a potential for complica-tions. Failure to diagnose fractures that require early treatment may result in intra-operative or post-operative complications due to fibrosis， contracture， and unsatisfactory union. Other postoperative complications may include loss of vision， trau-matic optic neuropathy， diplopia， overcorrection or undercorrec-tion of enophthalmos， lower eyelid retraction， bleeding， infec-tion， extrusion of an orbital implant， infraorbital nerve damage with resultant hypoesthesia， orbital congestion， and epiphora. A complete eye examination is needed postoperatively to assess for the sequelae of these complications adequately.\n\n【34】Case report\n\n【35】A 19-year-old man was brought to the emergency room with swelling and multiple wounds on his face after he was involved in a motorcycle accident 30 minutes earlier. He was riding a motorcycle with medium speed without wearing his safety helm. Then another motorcycle coming from the opposite direction hit him. He lost his balance and fell from the motorcycle with his face down. He was conscious all the time up to admission. The primary survey performed according to Advanced Trauma Live Support (ATLS) showed no live threatening condition. There was no history of alcohol consumption， nausea and vomiting. Multiple abrasive wounds were found on his face， left flank， both hands and both feet. There was asymmetrical face with oedema at the left cheek and left eye， ecchymosis at left lower eyelid with blur vision and restricted eye movement following left subconjunctival bleeding and normal light reflex. We found no wound intra-orally but there was no teeth occlusion and hematoma at left upper vestibule .\n\n【36】After careful physical examinations， we assessed his condi-tion with mid-facial fracture (left maxilla，left zygoma， left orbital rim inferior and lateral aspect) with suspect muscle entrapment of his left eyeball. Laboratory and radiographic imaging were taken to support the diagnostic . Immediate treatment was performed to control bleeding， reduce pain， prevent infec-tion and adjust occlusal displacement with interdental wiring using the arch bar . Then the patient was prepared for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). The surgical reposi-tion and fixation of the fractures were performed under generalT8anesthesia by an oral maxillofacial surgeon and an ophthalmolo-gist. Standard surgical kits for mid-facial fractures were used， completed by osteosynthetic material. Included were typical mini-plates of different shapes with different screw's lengths. The titanium plates and screws were stored in re-sterilized sets.\n\n【37】The surgery was performed in the supine position with fix-ation of head. The incision was made at oral vestibule for aes-thetics reason. After removing oral mucosa and muscle adjacent to maxillary bone， we found comminuted fracture at the ante-rior wall of the left maxillary sinus. Fixation using mini-plates and screws at facial buttress  successfully returned the patient facial contour to its former condition and occlusion was achieved.\n\n【38】A catheter balloon was inserted to the anterior side of left maxillary sinus through the widened ostium to obtain normal sinus volume and hold eyeball to its position using a 14-French urinary balloon catheter ， then injected with 10 mL of physiological saline solution to expand the balloon.\n\n【39】Forced duction test was performed after plate and screw had been placed to check the possibility of eye movement. The intraoral incision was sutured using Vicryl 4.0. At 21 day post-operative， we removed the urinary balloon catheters. We place mandibulo-maxillary fixation (MMF) in order to secure the oc-clusion and maintain for 14 days. The patient was followed up at one day， seven days and one month.\n\n【40】The patient was advised not to blow his nose for several\n\n【41】weeks post-surgery to prevent emphysema at the orbital region. Nasal decongestant sprays and corticosteroid were prescribed. We used prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infec-tion.\n\n【42】Discussion\n\n【43】Careful assessment of the trauma and considering possible in-jury complication are essential steps before deciding fracture treatmentInitial assessment of maxillofacial trauma must follow ad-vanced trauma life support (ATLS) principles as in all trauma victims. The first and most crucial sequence is maintaining air-way patency. Airway compromise might occur due to failing tongue， foreign bodies， hemorrhage at the oropharyngeal region， and mid-facial fractures itself.\n\n【44】Assessment of soft and hard tissues， radiographic exami-nation， and history taking of the eye struck by a large object commonly associated with blowout fracture. Direct force to the lateral side of the face can be related to suspected zygomatic fracture. Treatment of fracture required careful examination. Osteosynthesis can be performed after all fracture fragments were identified. Otherwise malposition of fixation the fragments might happen. The number， size， and position of plates and screws are depended on the anatomical and biomechanical prop-erties of the individual fracture and must follow Champylaw.6\n\n【45】Four air sinuses are lying in a human face. These sinuses serve as shock breaker to trauma， reduce facial skeleton weight， and help generate voice resonance. In normal condition， the maxillary sinus is the most significant air sinus and is located inside the cheekbone. It has thin and small anterior wall and are prone to fractures caused by direct trauma to the face such as in sports injury， violence and traffic accidents. Many problems arise if the fractured anterior wall of the maxillary sinus was untreated， like persistent epistaxis， rhinitis， intrusion of bone fragments， sinusitis， prolapse of the soft tissue from the cheeks into the sinus， and mucosa irritation.\n\n【46】Management of patients with orbital fractures is challenging and is still debated. There are still many controversies regard-ing the timing， material， indications and contraindication for surgery.\n\n【47】On almost every mid-facial trauma with a suspected eye injury， an ophthalmologist was always consulted for diagnosticevaluation and treatment advice.\n\n【48】Limited movement of eyeball might have been caused by entrapment of the perimuscular fascia or the inferior rectus into the fracture site. In the case of possible entrapment， one must assess for the signs of the oculocardiac reflex： bradycardia， nausea， and syncope. Another complication following muscle entrapment is the limitation of extraocular muscle motility due to oedema at orbital region or traumatic palsy of the third nerve branch to the inferior rectus may cause decreased extraocular movementsIndications for surgical treatment are divided into aesthetic or functional reasons. Most functional issues are related to en-trapment of the inferior rectus muscle or adjacent periorbital soft tissue. Aesthetic indications for surgical interventions involve globe malposition. The severity of these conditions dictates the need for an observation period of about two weeks. Recent liter-ature recommend early surgical repair because it gives a better outcome and patient comfort.\n\n【49】According to other publications by many authors， as per literature documented， there are various techniques used for the treatment of zygomatic bone and arch fracture. American and European maxillofacial surgeons are still debating on whether the reduction of a displaced and or fractured zygoma should be open or closed.\n\n【50】The high level of unpredictability was amongst the influenced factor challenging orbital reconstruction. A precise anatomical reconstruction does not guarantee a perfect outcome because soft tissue involvement poses difficulties in predicting thelong term effect on function and aesthetics.\n\n【51】In blowout fractures cases， early revision and repair have been considered the first-line treatment for optimal surgical out-come. Major clinical outcome parameters in patients with orbital fractures include cosmetic disturbance (enophthalmos)， func-tional impairment (vision， extraocular muscle motility disorders， and diplopia)， and infraorbital hypaesthesia. If the patients are children， muscle fibrosis and persistent diplopia may occur ifthere is muscle entrapment left untreated， even a minor muscle. If there is muscle entrapment known after surgery， intervention within 2-4 days is required.\n\n【52】Eyelid retraction sometimes occurs after surgery. This condi-tion can be solved by removing osteosynthesis material， in this case， the plate and screw， after 3 to 6 months from the surgery.\n\n【53】Literature shows that patients with multiple fractures face a greater risk for ophthalmic injuries， while the incidence of the ophthalmic problem is lower in cases of combined mandibu-lar and mid-facial fractures because the mandible acts as an absorbent to the impact.\n\n【54】Conclusion\n\n【55】Maxillofacial trauma planning is sometimes challenging and often involves a multidisciplinary approach. The first step in assessing a trauma patient，especially for those who are involved in multi-organ injuries， requires close evaluation and monitor-ing of airway， breathing， and circulatory condition. In this case， planning immediate surgical correction has given more comfort-ing benefit， reduce risk of malunion and prolonged eye injury also increase patient comfort. Aesthetics and functional goal must both be taken into account for facial reconstruction. Vision-threatening conditions should always be treated immediately before stabilizing the fracture site.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

In50-60% of patients with carcinoid syndrome， the vasoactive substances cause fibrosis of the pulmonary and tricuspid heart valves which lead to regurgitation and right-sided heart failure. The right side of the heart is usually affected because monoamine oxidases in the lungs usually inactivate the vasoactive substances.\n\n【2】Case Report： A 62-year-old woman presented with a four-month history of diarrhea and abdominal discomfort. The patienthad bilateral pelvic masses and elevated serum CA125 and an elevated urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid(5-HIAA). Total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) identified a prima-ry appendiceal carcinoid tumor with bilateral ovarian metastases. Post-operatively， a computed tomography(CT) scan showed cardiomegaly. Transthoracic echocardiography showed morphologic changes that affected all four heart valves， consistent with carcinoid heart disease but without a patent foramen ovale (PFO). The pa-tient was evaluated for valve replacement surgery， but surgery was not performed due to the degree of heartfailure.\n\n【3】Conclusions： This report describes a rare case of carcinoid heart disease with involvement of all four cardiac valves， but without the presence of a PFO， possibly due to a large amount of vasoactive substances in the patient's circu-lation， as supported by the patient’s elevated urinary 5-HIAA. This rare presentation highlights the importance of early diagnosis and treatment with tumor resection and， if possible， Cardiac valve replacement to prevent irreversible heart failure.\n\n【4】MeSH Keywords： Carcinoid Heart Disease ·Carcinoid Tumor · Heart Valve Diseases\n\n【5】Carcinoid tumors are rare， occurring in between 1.2-2.1 per100，000 people in the general population per year . Carcinoid tumors arise from enterochromaffin cells， with the most com-mon primary site of origin being the gastrointestinal tract. Carcinoid tumors release vasoactive substances including se-rotonin， tachykinins， and prostaglandins， which are mainly inactivated in the liver and lungs . In 20-30% of patients， the initial clinical manifestation of a carcinoid tumor is carci-noid syndrome which includes symptoms of cutaneous flush-ing， diarrhea， bronchospasm， and hypotension . Symptoms of carcinoid syndrome typically occur when the tumor metas-tasizes to the liver and the vasoactive substances enter the systemic circulation .\n\n【6】Carcinoid heart disease remains a major source of morbidity and mortality for patients with carcinoid syndrome， occurs in50-60% of patients with carcinoid syndrome， but most frequent-ly involves the tricuspid and pulmonary valves . Patients are often referred for valve replacement surgery before they de-velop heart failure， as valve replacement surgery is the most effective treatment .\n\n【7】In this report， a case of carcinoid heart disease is presented in a 62-year-old woman， with all four heart valves being affected. The patient had a primary appendiceal carcinoid tumor， which metastasized to both ovaries， but who did not have hepatic metastases or any form of intracardiac shunt. This rare presen-tation of carcinoid heart disease highlights the importance of early diagnosis and treatment with early carcinoid tumor re-section and valve replacement to avoid significant heart failure.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 62-year-old Caucasian woman presented to her primary care physician with a four-month history of diarrhea and abdomi-nal discomfort. She reported passing stools 4-6 times per day and waking from sleep 4-5 times per night with diarrhea. She noted pain (severity， 8/10) along the right side of her abdo-men. She also reported a lack of appetite， weight loss， abdom-inal bloating， extreme fatigue， and increased sleep. She de-nied any cutaneous flushing. An abdominal ultrasound was performed which showed ascites and a right pleural effusion. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed two well-defined，low-density areas in the left lobe of the liver， which appeared to be cystic. There was a small en-hancing focus in the upper anterior abdomen representing a possible omental metastasis， an 11.7x6.3 cm mass in the up-per right pelvis， and a 6.7 cm midline mass in the lower pel-vis. An omental biopsy and ultrasound-guided thoracentesis with cytology were performed. The omental biopsy showedno evidence of malignancy. The thoracentesis drained 280 ml of thin serous pleural fluid， and the cytology showed atypical cells. The tumor markers Ca19-9 and carcinoembryonic anti-gen (CEA) were found to be within normal limits， at 25.6 U/ml and 1.4 ng/ml， respectively. However， CA125 was elevated at 1，030.0 IU/ml (normal， ≤35.0 IU/ml).\n\n【10】On the basis of these studies， the patient was scheduled to undergo a total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO). At the time of surgery， the sur-geon found 2，200 ml of ascites in the abdomen， a 12x5 cm right ovarian mass，and an 8x8 cm left ovarian mass. There were tumor nodules， measuring approximately 1 cm in size， involving the peritoneum and small bowel mesentery， a hy-peremic appearing ileum with a tumor mass beneath the ile-um and cecum， with the involvement of the appendix and ex-tensive miliary omental disease. Histology of a frozen section of the ovary diagnosed a carcinoid tumor. The patient also had an elevated plasma level of chromogranin A at 947 ng/ml (normal <93 ng/ml).\n\n【11】As the surgeon began to manipulate the appendix， the pa-tient became hypotensive. She was given 500 mg of octreo-tide， which resulted in a positive response with stabiliza-tion of her vital signs. Because no octreotide had been given to the patient pre-operatively， and her disease was so ad-vanced， the decision was made to not perform an omentec-tomy or resection of the primary appendiceal tumor. The pa-tient tolerated the remainder of the procedure well. The final surgical pathology report was a metastatic carcinoid tumor involving both the left and right ovaries， which most to like-ly to have metastasized from the appendix. The left ovarian mass was 10.3×6.1×4.8 cm and the right ovarian mass was11.4x7.2x0.7 cm . Immunohistochemistry was per-formed and the tumor cells stained positively for both synap-tophysin and chromogranin， which supported the diagnosis of carcinoid tumor .\n\n【12】The following day， the patient underwent a computed tomogra-phy (CT) scan of the chest without contrast， which demonstrat-ed a large right and a small left pleural effusion， cardiomega-ly， abdominal ascites， but showed no pulmonary metastases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen was per-formed which showed no hepatic metastases.\n\n【13】A transthoracic echocardiogram was ordered to evaluate the cardiomegaly found on the CT scan of the chest. The echocar-diogram showed normal left ventricular size and systolic func-tion. The right ventricle was moderately dilated with reduced systolic function . The tricuspid valve leaflets were thickened and non-mobile， consistent with carcinoid changes with severe tricuspid regurgitation . The pulmonary valve was not well visualized but appeared to be thickenedwith severe pulmonic regurgitation. The posterior mitral valve leaflet also appeared thickened and non-mobile， and there was mild mitral regurgitation . The aortic valve was not well visualized， but there was moderate aortic regurgitation. There was no evidence of a patent foramen ovale(PFO) or an atrial septal defect (ASD) by color Doppler.\n\n【14】A cardiology consultation was requested on the following day for heart failure management. Clinically， the patient demon-strated signs of right-sided heart failure and appeared to be fluid overloaded (net of 13 liters since admission). Physical examination identified a 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the right upper sternal border， elevated jugular venous pressure to the angle of the jaw with a prominent V wave， a hepatic-jugular reflux， a right-ventricular heave， and severe lower extremity edema. She also had an elevated aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) measured at 206 units/l and176 units/l， respectively， and likely to have been due to hepat-ic congestion from tricuspid regurgitation. The patient had a pro b-type natriuretic peptide (proBNP) of 2，056 pg/ml (nor-mal， <125 pg/mL) and her urinary 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid(5-HIAA) was 15 mg/24 hr (normal， <8.0 mg/24hr).\n\n【15】Intravenous (I) furosemide was administered at a rate of10 mg/hour with a daily goal of net negative 1.5-2 liters/day fluid balance. Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted to dis-cuss valve replacement surgery. The patient’s Gupta myocar-dial infarction or cardiac arrest (MICA) calculator was around3.5%， and the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) score was>11%， which estimated a high risk of perioperative myocar-dial infarction. Due to the high perioperative cardiac risk， the patient's severely decompensated heart failure， and progres-sive disease， the patient was not considered to be a suitable surgical candidate.\n\n【16】Since all four heart valves were affected by carcinoid disease， the surgery required to improve the patient's right-sided and left-sided heart failure would have involved replacing all four valves， which was not possible. Other interventional cardi-ac procedures， such a percutaneous valve replacement， were not considered due to the patient’s severely decompensat-ed heart failure and because all four valves needed to be re-placed. Therefore， the decision was made to treat her heart failure medically with furosemide 40 mg orally twice daily，spi-ronolactone 12.5 mg orally daily， and metoprolol succinate 25mg orally daily. She was scheduled for clinical follow-up in the heart failure clinic one week after hospital discharge. Regarding the treatment of her carcinoid syndrome， she received octreo-tide 20 mg intramuscularly and was scheduled to receive the same dose once per month.\n\n【17】The patient was discharged from the hospital and did well for one week at home. At the initial follow-up visit， she was found to be malnourished with superimposed infection. She was re-admitted to the hospital. Unfortunately， the patient died from decompensated heart failure about a month after she was dis-charged from the initial hospital admission.\n\n【18】Cardiac involvement occurs in 50-60% of patients with car-cinoid syndrome . The plaques that develop on the heart valves are composed of myofibroblasts， smooth muscle cells， and extracellular matrix components， such as collagen. The results of these plaques are retraction and fixation of the valve leaflets， reduced motion， and valve regurgitation . While the pathogenesis and development of carcinoid heart plaques are incompletely understood， there is evidence that suggests serotonin (5-HT) plays a key role， specifically through the activation of serotonin 2B receptors on the surface of the valves . Serotonin is metabolized to 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) by monoamine oxidases in the liver and secreted into the urine . Patients with carcinoid heart disease have significantly higher levels of urinary 5-HIAA compared to pa-tients with carcinoid syndrome without cardiac involvement， which supports the role serotonin plays in the development of carcinoid heart disease .\n\n【19】When a carcinoid tumor is isolated in the gastrointestinal tract， carcinoid heart disease is not commonly seen， because the va-soactive substances released from the tumor drain through the portal venous system to the liver， where they are inacti-vated by monoamine oxidases. Carcinoid heart disease is typi-cally seen in cases of carcinoid tumor that metastasizes to the liver. If hepatic metastases are present， the vasoactive sub-stances can reach the heart because they drain directly from the liver into the systemic venous circulation and avoid inac-tivation . This case is unique because， although the patient did not have hepatic metastases， she still developed carcinoid heart disease. The explanation for this presentation is most likely due to the metastasis of the carcinoid tumor from the gastrointestinal tract to the ovaries. The ovarian veins drain di-rectly into the inferior vena cava， instead of the portal system. This anatomical design allows the vasoactive substances to bypass the liver completely and avoid hepatic inactivation .\n\n【20】Left-sided heart involvement occurs in less than 10% of pa-tients with carcinoid heart disease. The preferential right-sided involvement is due to inactivation of vasoactive substances by\n\n【21】Conclusions\n\n【22】This case report has shown how three factors presenting to-gether， bilateral ovarian metastases， lack of hepatic metasta-ses， and lack of an intracardiac shunt can lead to severe car-cinoid heart disease involving all four heart valves.

Experience with radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of hydatid cysts， especially in children， is limited.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】Although echinococcosis is rare， especially in children， we describe a 7-year-old boy with lung and liver cystic echinococcosis. Diagnosis was established by clinical history and imaging findings and confirmed by positive antiechinococcal antibodies. After 6 months of chemotherapy with albendazole， the liver lesion remained and a radiofrequency ablation under computed tomography guidance was obtained. The procedure was performed with a new type of ablation electrode in order to minimize handling and procedure duration and to achieve the best clinical result in only 1 session. This type of electrode provides the ability to simultaneously drain and ab-late the cyst and the ability to monitor the desired ablation temperature in real time.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】Our patient is the first pediatric case with hepatic hydatid cyst treated successfully with the use of a new type of radiofrequency ablation electrode under computed tomography guidance.\n\n【6】MeSH Keywords： Child·Echinococcosis， Hepatic· Pulsed Radiofrequency Treatment\n\n【7】Human echinococcosis is a parasitic disease caused by tapeworms of the genus Echinococcus. The 2 most important forms， are cys-tic echinococcosis (CE) caused by infection with Echinococcus granulosus； and alveolar echinococcosis (AE) caused by infec-tion with E multilocularis . Humans are infected through in-gestion of parasite eggs in contaminated water， food， or soil or through direct contact with animals. A number of animals act as intermediate hosts of Echinococcus. They become infected by in-gesting the parasite eggs in contaminated material， and the par-asite then develops into larval stages in the viscera. Carnivores are infected through the consumption of viscera of intermedi-ate hosts and act as definitive hosts for the parasite.\n\n【8】Cystic echinococcosis is a rare disease， especially in pediat-ric patients . According to guidelines ， chemotherapy combined with minimal invasive techniques seems to be the treatment of choice for most cases. Based on evidence pro-vided mainly by an experimental study in animal models ， we decided to perform percutaneous radiofrequency ablation(RFA) instead of the puncture， aspiration， injection， reaspira-tion procedure (PAIR) to treat hepatic hydatid cyst. The pro-cedure was performed with a new type of electrode that as-sures drainage and ablation at the same time.\n\n【9】Case Report\n\n【10】A 7-year-old boy presented to the Emergency Department due to a fever that began 4 days before， severe coughing， and mildabdominal pain. His parents reported taking the child on a trip to a rural area of Albania a few months ago. Past medical his-tory was otherwise unremarkable. Physical examination re-vealed crackling in the right upper lung lobe and mild spleno-megaly. Laboratory investigation showed mild leukocytosis with eosinophilia (17 000 white blood cells/pl， absolute eosinophil count 1585 cells/ul). Chest x-ray revealed consolidation involv-ing the right lung upper lobe. Abdominal ultrasound showed mild hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. At part VIII of the liver， a 4-cm cyst was found. He immediately started antimicrobial therapy and underwent a lung computed tomography (CT) scan that revealed a consolidation with air bronchogram in the right lung upper lobe. Lack of response to the empirical antimicro-bial medication， the reported travel to an endemic echinococ-cosis area， and the imaging findings were indicative for cystic echinococcosis， so albendazole (15 mgr/kgr) was added to his medication. The diagnosis of echinococcosis was confirmed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detection of lgG antibodies against E. granulosus antigens (titer 1/4000).\n\n【11】Reevaluation of our patient 2 months after chemotherapy with albendazole revealed complete recession of the lung hydatid cyst  but no response of the hepatic hydatid cyst. Albendazole treatment was continued. Our patient complet-ed 6 months of chemotherapy medication with albendazole and was then reevaluated.Classification of the hepatic hydatid cyst was made according to World Health Organization (WHO) classification with the use of ultrasound. The cyst presented as uniformly anechoic with fine echoes sett led in it， represent-ing hydatid sand， stage CE 1. According to treatment guide-lines， our patient had all indications to undergo the puncture，aspiration， injection， reaspiration procedure (PAIR). Instead of PAIR， we decided to perform radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the hepatic cyst under computed tomography guidance， which is a promising new method. Our patient underwent pre-pro cedural blood tests， including measurements of hemoglobin concentration， international normalized ratio， partial throm-boplastin time， and platelet count. His parents were informed and signed a written consent form before the procedure. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia due to the possibility of anaphylaxis， although he was treated with albendazole for 6 months .\n\n【12】The radiofrequency ablation procedure was performed by an interventional radiologist (LT) with 20 years of experience in CT-guided percutaneous interventions.\n\n【13】The imaging modality used for percutaneous electrode guid-ance was spiral CT (Brightspeed Elite 16 RT， GE healthcare， USA) with a neonatal low-dose scan protocol (80 kV， 33 mAs， slice width 5 mm， feed/rotation 16， kernel B40s， CT dose index0.9) and the minimum number of scans (n=12). The patientwas placed in supine position and the ablation route was cho-sen by the interventional radiologist. Ablation was performed with a CysTip electrode diameter (1.5 mm， length 15 cm) (RF Medical Co. Ltd， Seoul， Korea) connected to a radiofrequen-cy generator M-3004 (200W Multifunctional Generator@， RF Medical Co. Ltd.， Seoul， Korea). This new type of electrode gives the ability to aspirate and ablate a cyst simultaneously. At the same time， we can measure internal temper-ature and cyst wall temperature in real time by moving tem-perature sensor. A grounding pad was placed on the patient’s skin in an area of good electrical conductivity (typically the thigh) to complete the electrical circuit and avoid burn inju-ries. Pulse radiofrequency ablation energy was applied for 10min at 90-110 W. The maximum tissue temperature ranged from 90℃ to 110C. Initially， ablation was performed for 5 min in a full-content hydatid cyst， then aspiration of the contents of the cyst occurred simultaneously with the ablation proce-dure， which was completed in 10 min.\n\n【14】The ablation was designed to induce coagulation necrosis of the germinal layer of the cyst. Technically successful ablationoccurs when a decrease in cyst size is noted. To evaluate the immediate response of the lesion to ablation， and to identi-fy any complications， a spiral CT was performed immediately after the procedure. A post-procedural CT revealed decreased cyst size <2 cm due to overlapping of the cyst wall， and no complications were noted. Our patient was hospitalized for24-h monitoring and was discharged the next day， as no com-olications occurred.\n\n【15】Follow-up was performed with clinical examination and ultra-sonography at 1 month and 3 months after the ablation when the cyst was classified as CE4 stage， with diameter of 2.8 cm. One month after the ablation， the absolute eosin-ophil count was normal (450 cells/pl) and echinococcal anti-bodies had decreased (titer 1/780). No recurrence of the ab-lated cyst occurred during 3-year follow-up.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a zoonosis caused by Echinococcus granulosus. This tapeworm can occasionally cause illness in in-termediate hosts， such as humans. Cysts contains thousands of protoscoleces and many daughter cysts. Cysts act as a space-occupying lesions on adjacent tissues. Cyst fluid contains par-asite antigen that can sensitize the host . Urgent anaphy-lactic reaction takes place if a cyst ruptures spontaneously or during surgical procedures . Mean annual incidence rates vary from less than 0.01 cases per 100 000 inhabitants to higher levels in endemic areas， such as Mediterranean coun-tries. In Greece， the mean annual incidence rate is estimated at0.16/100 000 inhabitants， whereas in Albania it is estimated at0.6/100 000 inhabitants.The organs most frequently affectedare the liver and lungs . Treatment is determined accord-ing to the standardized ultrasound classification as proposed by the WHO . CE1 and CE2 are active cysts containing viable protoscoleces. CE3 has been subdivided into CE3a (de-tached endocyst) and CE3b (predominantly solid with vesicle cysts). CE4 and CE5 are inactive. CE4 has mixed hypo-and hy-perechoic content with absence of daughter cysts， giving the appearance of a ball of wool (wool sign)， and CE5 has arch-like， thick， partially or completely calcified walls. In CE1 and CE3a<5 cm， the treatment of choice is albendazole ， whereas in cysts with diameter >5 cm， albendazole is combined with conventional percutaneous procedures such as PAIR . PAIR with ethanol or hypertonic saline is established as a therapeu-tic option for hepatic lesions， while experience in lung echi-nococcosis is limited . Surgery ， and in some cases PAIR， may cause post-procedure complications such as cyst in-fection or abscess ， biliary fistulae ， and chemical chol-angitis due to injection of hypertonic saline or ethano! dur-ing the procedure.\n\n【18】The use of RFA as a treatment for hydatid cysts instead of PAIR was first reported by Brunetti  and then by Bastid . CT-guided RFA in children is a well-known minimally inva-sive method to treat osteoid osteomas and lesser malignan-cies . RFA causes protein denaturation via high tempera-tures exceeding 60℃ Thus， destruction of the germinal layer is achieved without injection of any scolicidal agent， minimiz-ing the possibility of complications. RFA is easy to perform； it consists of just 1 step with 1 puncture， and aspiration， injec-tion， and reaspiration are not needed.\n\n【19】Brunetti  reported the treatment of 5 patients with 6 CE3b hepatic cysts. The procedure was effective in all patients.\n\n【20】Efficacy assessment was based on the presence of scolices in post-procedure cyst fluid microscopic examination. Relapse was noted 12 months after the procedure in cases where full ablation was not achieved due to the cyst structure. Complications， specifically abscess， occurred in 1 patient. The poor results achieved in the study may be due to application of the method in an inappropriate group of patients. In our case， unlike Brunetti et al.， we evaluated RFA efficacy accord-ing to decreased cyst size， ultrasonographic staging impair-ment，and decrease in eosinophils and echinococcal antibod-ies. Bastid et al.treated 1 patient with a CE2 hepatic cyst； in 6-month follow-up， no mid-term complications or relapse occurred. Limited data present RFA as an effective and safe procedure， with a high success rate in treatment of cystic he-patic lesions . No preliminary animal studies were per-formed before the application of this technique in human CE. Lamonaca et al. published an ex-vivo experimental study to evaluate RFA for treatment of cystic echinococcosis in ani-mal models. Nine liver and 8 lung cysts were treated with RFA. The success rate was 100% in both hepatic and lung cysts. The study revealed the efficacy of RFA in treating explanted hydatid cysts. Cyst volume reduction after PAIR or pericys-tectomy is estimated to be 65% or more at 6-19 months af-ter treatment . Lamonaca observed the same level of vol-ume reduction immediately after RFA treatment. Evaluation of RFA effectiveness in our patient confirms the results of the study performed in animal models . We noted immediate decrease in cyst volume and satisfactory immediate necrosisof the cyst wall. If we did not have the ability to use the abla-tion electrode called CystTip， an alternative would have been use of a conventional RFA electrode with a second aspiration needle in place， to aspirate it first and then ablate (with the RFA electrode still in place)， but the technique can cause in appropriate ablation and an unnecessary second puncture.\n\n【21】Complications， such as biliary fistula， after liver hydatid cyst surgery or PAIR  are decreased with RFA because coagu-lative necrosis is accomplished without detaching the endo-cyst from the pericystium.\n\n【22】Conclusions\n\n【23】We described a pediatric patient with hepatic hydatid cyst treated with a new radiofrequency electrode called CystTip. This type of electrode ensures simultaneous drainage and ab-lation of the cyst， thus minimizing interventions needed and procedure duration， thereby reducing complications. Hydatid cyst treatment is achieved in a single section， since RFA causes thermal necrosis of the entire cyst wall. Furthermore， RFA avoids the use of hypertonic saline or ethanol， thus minimizing the risk of complications such as chemical cholangitis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The occult source of bleeding was identified by abdominal computed tomog raphy (CT) as splenic hemorrhage. Treatment began with the administration of antivenom and blood transfu-sion. Splenic artery angio-embolization was performed to control the bleeding and was without complication. Snakebite envenoming associated with VICC is a serious and life-threatening condition. Because of the possi-bility of associated occult bleeding from internal organs or blood vessels， imaging studies should be performed as soon as possible. For patients who are hemodynamically stabilized and have atraumatic hemorrhage fromthe spleen， non-operative treatment using angio-embolization may be performed with intensive monitoring and follow-up.\n\n【6】MeSH Keywords： Blood Coagulation Disorders · Embolization， Therapeutic· Snake Venoms· Splenic DiseasesSnakebite envenoming results from injection of a mixture dif-ferent toxins following snakebite， and includes coagulopathy and life-threatening hemorrhage， or venom-induced consump-tion coagulopathy (VICC). Worldwide， VICC occurs as a result of bites by vipers， most Australasian elapid snakes， and a few species of colubrids . VICC results from the combined ef-fects of toxins， which include phospholipase A， (PLA.)， snake venom serine protease (SVSP)， and snake venom metallopro-tease (SVMP) . Bleeding may be mild and involve local-ized bleeding from the site of the snakebite， but can be sys-temic and life-threatening and include gastrointestinal and intracranial hemorrhage .\n\n【7】Currently， there have been few previously reported cases of spontaneous atraumatic liver or splenic hemorrhage due to snakebite . In most previously reported cases， inacces-sibility of the splenic artery prevented arterial embolization， and if arterial embolization was performed， the patients were hemodynamically unstable and required splenectomy . When surgery was performed， mechanical ventilation and continuous hemodialysis were required due to complications from surgery .\n\n【8】A case is presented of a patient who was treated with antive-nom for snakebite at another hospital， but who subsequently developed delayed VICC with splenic hemorrhage， who was suc-cessfully treated without complications by splenic artery embo-lization， blood transfusion， and additional antivenom therapy.\n\n【9】Case Report\n\n【10】A 62-year-old man with a history of hypertension， benign pros-tate hypertrophy， and right hip joint arthroplasty performed three years previously， was admitted to the emergency de-partment of another hospital with dizziness followed by loss of consciousness during breakfast. He had been bitten by a snake on his left index finger three days previously and was treated with antivenom. On admission， his blood pressure was70/50 mmHg. His complete blood cell count (CBC) parame-ters included a white blood cell (WBC) count of 10，700 per ul， hemoglobin (Hb) of 12.0 g/dL， hematocrit (Hct) of 35%， and a platelet count of 136，000 perul.\n\n【11】He was transferred to the emergency department of our hos-pital due to hypotension. On admission， he was alert with a blood pressure of 92/58 mmHg， heart rate of 59 beats/min， a respiratory rate of 16/min， and a body temperature of 36.1℃. The patient had no complaints， other than pain in the left in-dex finger. Physical examination showed swelling and a focal hemorrhagic bulla on the left index finger . There wasno systemic subcutaneous hemorrhage，bleeding of the gums， or purpura. There was no abdominal tenderness， and the re-spiratory and heart sounds were normal. The initial electro-cardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm. There were no abnormalities on plain film chest X-ray.\n\n【12】On this admission， the CBC parameters included a WBC count of 8，760 per ul， Hb of 9.7 g/dL， Hct of 29.1%， and a platelet count of 125，000 per pl. Routine biochemistry tests were in the normal range， including serum electrolytes，aspartate amino-transferase (AST)， alanine aminotransferase (ALT)， creatinine， and creatinine kinase (CK). Blood coagulation tests showed a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) of 26.2 seconds (normal range， 11.6-15.5 seconds)， an increased international normal-ized ratio (INR) of 2.37 (normal range， 0.87-1.24)， a normal activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 39.2 seconds(normal range， 28.0-45.0 seconds) and an increased D-dimer level >20 pg/ml (normal range， 0-0.5 ng/ml). Reticulocytes were normal at 1.9%， the antithrombin Ill level was reduced to 56%， fibrinogen was reduced at <60 mg/dL， and the level of fibrin degradation products (FDPs) was increased 14.7 pg/ml.\n\n【13】Continuous monitoring of the patient’s vital signs showed inter-mittent hypotension and reduced Hb and Hct measurements. Gastric lavage was performed using a nasogastric tube and a digital rectal examination excluded gastrointestinal bleeding. Continuous infusion of normal saline began， and two unitsof packed red blood cells were transfused to correct his ane-mia (Hb 9.7 g/dL). Antivenom was administered (freeze-dried Agkistrodon antivenom 6000 U).\n\n【14】Three hours after admission to our emergency department， the patient complained of sudden abdominal pain， and mild epigastric tenderness was found on abdominal examination. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) was performed to de termine the cause of his abdominal pain. Abdominal CT showed splenic aiterial bleeding and hemoperitoneum . At this stage， his blood pressure was 99/61 mmHg， his pulse rate was 56 beats/minute， and his follow-up CBC parameters included a Hb 6.7 of g/dL Hct of 19.2%， and a platelet count of 89，000 ul， which were reduced when compared with the findings on initial admission to the emergency department.\n\n【15】Three units packed red blood cells and three units of fresh fro-zen plasma were transfused. Urgent angiography with splenic arterial embolization was performed using Histoacryl/Lipiodol mixture . The patient was then admitted to the inten-sive care unit (ICU) for close observation. Packed red blood cells， fresh frozen plasma， and platelets were transfused until the next day when the patient's vital signs stabilized. Antivenom was administered until the third hospitalization day and coag ulation function was normalized. On the fourth hospital day， a follow-up abdominal CT scan was performed， which con-firmed that there were no signs of active bleeding from the splenic artery， and the hemoperitoneum was slightly decreased. After the CT scan， the patient was transferred to\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Snake venom is a complex natural toxin comprising proteins and metallic ions， carbohydrates， hexanes， amines， and lip-ids . Snake venom contains enzymatic protein toxins that include phospholipase A， (PLA，)， snake venom serine protease(SVSP)， and snake venom metalloprotease (SVMP)， L-aminoacid oxidase， and phosphoesterase . The venom also contains C-type lectin receptor， and disintegrin coagulation factors that act on the vascular endothelium， resulting in vessel wall injury， impaired platelet aggregation， and increased capillary perme-ability and bleeding .\n\n【18】Spontaneous and atraumatic splenic hemorrhage is a poten-tially life-threatening condition that can be associated with in-fection， bleeding disorders， and malignancy . In the present case， there was no recent trauma， and treatment was success-fully performed with non-surgical management. Unlike previ-ously reported cases ， splenectomy and histology of the spleen were not performed. Therefore， it was not possible to exclude other causes of splenic hemorrhage， such as the pres-ence of tumors or infection. Also， even though we could not ex-clude vascular injury， the history of snakebite was considered to be the cause of splenic hemorrhage or venom-induced con-sumption coagulopathy (VICC) due to snakebite envenoming.\n\n【19】The presence of coagulopathy was confirmed from the find-ings of the blood tests， including a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and increased international normalized ratio (INR)， reduced fibrinogen， and increased levels of D-dimer and fibrindegradation products (FDPs). In this case， antivenom had been administered at a previous hospital， but VICC and splenic hem-orrhage could not be prevented. This may have been because the dose of antivenom was insufficient or the antivenom couldhave combined with the venom， reducing its potency and re-sulting in delayed symptoms of toxicity .\n\n【20】When VICC results in organ hemorrhage， treatment for VICC and organ hemorrhage should be performed simultaneously. In the treatment of VICC， antivenom should be given to pre-vent consumptive coagulopathy， although the timing of treat-ment remains controversial . Also， once the toxin is com-bined with the antivenom， it is helpful to transfuse fresh frozen plasma to replace the deficient coagulation factors . However， there are no guidelines regarding the management of atraumatic splenic rupture and how it should differ from the management of traumatic splenic injury . Renzulli et al.  recommended that patients with atraumatic splenic rupture with a non-malignant etiology may be treated with organ-pre-serving surgery， and the non-surgical approach of transcath-eter arterial embolization.\n\n【21】The trend for the management of patients with solid organ in-jury continues to favor a non-surgical approach using a con-servative management technique. Splenic embolization is in-creasingly used for both stable patients and for patients who do not respond to fluid and blood replacement. For patients with uncontrolled bleeding from rupture of the spleen and se-vere hemodynamic instability， splenectomy is the treatment of choice . However， non-operative treatment can be a safe option if appropriate diagnostic evaluation has been un-dertaken， and close monitoring and surgical supervision are used in selected hemodynamically stable patients . Although non-operative treatment was reported to be un-successful in previously reported cases， based on our experi-ence， splenic hemorrhage due to snakebite envenoming can be treated with angio-embolization in addition to antivenom therapy and blood transfusion. After antivenom therapy and procedures for hemostasis， close observation is required， as ad-ditional complications may develop. Follow-up tests and imag-ing studies to assess coagulopathy or re-bleeding should be performed to evaluate treatment response or delayed VICC.\n\n【22】The clinical presentation of atraumatic， spontaneous splenic hemorrhage is similar to traumatic splenic injury and includes classical signs and symptoms such as left upper quadrant pain，abdominal guarding on examination， and hemodynamic insta-bility . However， in this case， the patient presented with hypotension， the patient did not initially complain of abdom-inal pain， and symptoms of abdominal pain developed during later examinations. In this case， the combination of blood tests that showed decreased levels of coagulation factors， and im-aging using abdominal computed tomography (CT) confirmed bleeding from the spleen. The patient was treated with emer-gency transfusion， and additional antivenom treatment was initiated. Although gastrointestinal lavage and digital rectal ex-amination were initially used to identify the source of bleed-ing， focused assessment sonography for trauma (FAST) and CT scan were not initially performed.\n\n【23】For the patient who presents with hypotension and coagu-lopathy following a snakebite， the diagnosis of spontaneous atraumatic intra-abdominal hemorrhage can be challenging as there is no associated trauma and the symptoms are non-specific and subtle. However， delayed diagnosis may be life-threatening. In a patient with a snakebite who presents with nonspecific symptoms that include abdominal pain and diz-ziness with hypotension， the physician should be alert to the possibility of occult intra-abdominal hemorrhage secondary to snakebite envenoming and VICC. As this case has shown， the definitive diagnosis of the site of occult hemorrhage can be determined using CT， and serial hemoglobin levels should be measured.\n\n【24】Conclusions\n\n【25】This case has shown that in atraumatic splenic hemorrhage fol-lowed by snakebite envenoming， non-operative treatment us-ing angio-embolization of the splenic artery may be performed. This procedure should be followed by close monitoring of pa-tients who respond to initial resuscitation or who are hemo dynamically stable because the patient might still be at risk of delayed coagulopathy and occult hemorrhage.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It is often misdiagnosed as eczema. The disease affects mainly the people over the age of50. Biopsy is the only means that provides an accurate differential diagnosis.\n\n【2】Case report：\n\n【3】This case study describes an 80 year old patient suffering from the extramammary Paget’s disease localized on the left inguinal’s skin. The diagnosis of Paget’s disease was confirmed by a histopathological examination.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】The clinical pictures of extramammary Paget’s disease still makes difficulties in everyday der-matological practice.\n\n【6】Key words： extramammary Paget's disease·histopathological examination· surgical treatmentSir James Paget first described paget’s disease in1874. He presented the cases of 15 women whose chronic skin rash in the mamillary region was con-nected with deeper localized mammary cancer . Fifteen years later， Crocker published the first case of the extramammary form of the same disease af-fecting the scrotal and penile skin . Although over100 years have passed and clinical and histological features of the mammary form are generally known and accepted， extramammary Paget’s disease still makes difficulties in diagnosis and its pathogenesis remains unclear.\n\n【7】Extramammary location is rarely stated. Apocrine gland lesions mo S mOst often occur in anogenital and axillary region and occasionally in the umbilical re-gion. Isolated cases of the disease appearing in the acoustic external duct， palpebra， oesophagus， urethra and bladder region were described， too. The disease affects mainly the people over the age of 50 .\n\n【8】The significant point in the histological picture is the existence of cells with a large， vesicular， hypo-or hyperchromatic nucleus and very bright cytoplasm in the epidermis and glandular ducts. These are so called“Paget’s cells\". They are arranged in clusters or singularly between the spinosus cell layer and the basal cell layer. They lack tonofibriles and intercel-lular bridges. In the PAS reaction the content of the bright cytoplasm， with a large amount of polysac-charide and glycogen is noted. Paget’s cells contain alarge amount of PAS(+) diastase resistant substance- sialomucine -which proves their glandular origin and they demonstrate negative tyrosine activity . Immunohistochemical analysis may be effected as well in order to evaluate carcinoembryonic anti-gen (CEA)， apocrine epithelium antigen (AEA)， Ca-15，3， S-100， and other selective neoplastic mark-ers for the diagnosis and differentiation of Paget's disease .\n\n【9】At present three theories related to the deriva-tion of Paget’s disease are emphasized. They are as follows：\n\n【10】1\\. Derivation from adenocarcinoma emerging multi-focally in undifferentiated epithelial cells.\n\n【11】2\\. Derivation from adenocarcinoma in situ， origi-nating from sweat glands， with subsequent ductal migration to the epidermis.\n\n【12】3\\. Derivation from mutation events caused by various carcinogenic factors on the epidermis， on the skin appendages and on the adjacent organs.\n\n【13】There are also cases of so called secondary extra-mammary Paget’s disease related to the direct expansion of lower localized carcinoma to the epi-thelium .\n\n【14】The purpose of the study was to present an interest-ing diagnostic case of extramammary Paget’s disease with a medical history of many months.\n\n【15】CASE REPORT\n\n【16】An 80-year-old patient， was admitted to the Dermatological Ward in order to diagnose a skin lesion on the left groin， which had persisted for the last six months. He was presented also six month earlier to the outpatient dermatological clinic with generalized skin rash and intertrigo eczema on the skin of both the left and right inguinal areas. In the mycological examination Erythrasma and Tinea cru-ris was excluded. After general antihistaminic drug treatment and application of local anti-inflammatory and disinfectant preparations， the lesion on the right groin regressed. The focus on the left groin remained. Despite treatment in the region， no improvement was recorded， although a periodic decrease of in-flammatory state and exudation was achieved. For this reason the patient was referred to hospital with a view to further diagnostic.\n\n【17】On admission the lesion was localized in the left inguinal fold and had spread laterall. The focus was of an irregular shape， sharply circumscribed from the healthy skin， with a slight reddening， irregularly infiltrated， with superficial erosions. Maceration of the epidermis was visible from the side of the scrotum. There were no signs of desquamation .\n\n【18】As to deviations from other systems， disturbed urine stream was ascertained by virtue of the medical his-tory of the patient. Other deviations from the regular state were not apparent from either the subjective or objective examination.\n\n【19】Basic analyses： Hb (haemoglobin) 8，5 mmol/l，RBC(red blood cells) 4，7 T/L， HCT (haematocrit) 0，41， WBC (white blood cells) 5，6 G/L， PLT 105 G/L， ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) 12， general urinalysis was correct. Bacteriological lesion swab：Citrobacter sp./+ ++/. Urological assessment was also recommended and showed prostatic hypertro-phy. PSA (Prostatic Specific Antigen) was within normal range.\n\n【20】The diagnosis of Paget’s disease was confirmed by a histopathological examination .\n\n【21】The patient was referred to the Oncology Department for surgery and the lesion was excised. The loss wasclosed by means of a local plastic operation. The result of the postoperative histopathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of extramammary Paget’s disease. The lesion did not extend to the excision margins.\n\n【22】In view of the prostatic hypertrophy mentioned above， further urological treatment was recommended.\n\n【23】DISCUSSION\n\n【24】The typical clinical picture of extramammary Paget’s disease includes a well circumscribed erythematous-exudative focus with the existence of superficial des-quamation，erosions or ulceration with concomitant itching and burning sensation. The characteristic feature is the unilateral existence of the lesion. The differential diagnosis of extrammary Paget’s dis-ease includes eczematous dermatitis， tinea corporis，intertrigous Candida infection， erythrasma， Bowen’s disease， human papilomaviral-induced intraepithe-lial neoplasia and amenlanotic superficial spreading melanoma . In the case study described above， the primary skin rash was localized bilaterally in the groins. After several months of treatment， the lesion regressed on one side. Failure of the second site to react to drugs suggested that Paget’s disease could be involved.\n\n【25】Taking into consideration the frequent mistakes relating to skin rash diagnosis in the case of Paget’s disease ， one should emphasize the diagnostic value of biopsy， which is the decisive examination.\n\n【26】According to the literature， in 20-54% of extrama-mmary Paget’s disease cases， the coexistence of a malignant neoplasm is observed. Therefore detailed diagnostic investigation with regards to neoplastic C11V6changes must always be conducted . Cellular immunity seems to play role in the pre-vention and cure of malignant and premalignant cutaneous neoplasias. Specific enhancement of the local immunity would be desirable. Imiquimod is one of immune response modifiers. The drug has beenshown to have both antiviral and antitumor activity. It semms that the application of immune response activators or modifiers such as imiquimod might be premising in the cases of Paget’s diseases . In the case study described above the patient was only found to be suffering from prostatic hypertrophy. If a malignant neoplasm is excluded， the prognosis is good， especially when the radical treatment is applied. The radical treatment in that situation was the surgical removal of the lesion with maintenance of a margin of healthy tissues. There is an increasing amount of articles in the literature on the effective treatment of Paget’s disease by means of chemo-therapy (5-flurouracile， cisplatine， cyclofosfamide， adriamicine， mitomicine， epirubicine， vinkrystine) and radiotherapy . There are also reports of CO2and Nd： YAG laser treatment being used.\n\n【27】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【28】In conclusion， in patients with chronic and not typi-cal clinical picture of skin lesions of the anogenital localization extrammamary Paget’s disease should be sought.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "5f504636-1da7-4f6c-8917-c4d7a5cfba55", "title": null, "text": "【0】ABSTRACTUrolithiasis in infants are relatively rare， and because of its nature in presenting with Non-specific symptoms the diagnosis of infantile urolithiasis may be rather challenging leading to delayed treatment thus may cause renal damage and subsequent failure by stone obstruction. The evaluation includes complete medical history and physical examination complemented by appropriate laboratory and imaging studies. We present a case report of a 9 month infant with bilateral nephrolithiasis presenting with acute urinary obstruction caused by impacted anterior urethral stone.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Pediatric urolithiasis，nephrocalcinosis， Pediatric Urinary Retention\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Urolithiasis is less common in the pediatric age group where the incidence is almost 10% of that in adults. Urolithiasis in infants represents 20% of the frequency of urolithiasis retrieved in the whole pediatric age group and microcalculi or Nephro-calcinosis might be the first step in stone formationp. The predisposing factor is multifactorial， including genetic inheri-tance， nutrition， metabolic and anatomical abnormalities， uri-nary tract infection， environmental factors， and stone-inducing drugs， but it is more often associated with metabolic abnor-malities including hypercalciuria， hypocitraturia， hyperoxaluria， hyperuricosuria， and cystinuria. Children are not able to express complaints such as flank pain， and typical clinical features are lr urinary retention， irritability， and signs of infection. Although challenging， the diagnosis and decision making on treatments should be based on thorough evaluation of the underlying risk factors， therefore avoiding recurrence.\n\n【4】A 9 months old male baby was referred to the surgery depart-ment with the primary complaint of urinary retention. The symptoms started three days before admission described as de-creased volume of urine， abdominal distention， and irritability. The patient was delivered at term by non-complicated vaginal delivery weighing 3300 grams， height 3，6 cm. The mother was di-agnosed with hyperthyroid through pregnancy and was treated with Propylthiouracil (PTU). There was no family history of urolithiasis. Physical examination confirmed a well-nourished baby (body weight 8800 gr， height 71cm) with normal vital sign. An enlarged bladder was palpated as well as a hard mass at the proximal part of the anterior urethra. The penis presented with hyperemia， oedema， and stenotic meatus . Urinalysis confirmed leukocytosis. There were no calcifications on plain abdominal radiography ， abdominal ultrasonography revealed bilateral nephrolithiasis 5 mm in diameter on the mid pole of the right kidney， and on the lower pole of the left kidney there were multiple stones with diameters of 3，8 mm and 6，6mm， without hydronephrosis on both sides . The pa-tient underwent dorsal meatotomy. Single stone with a diameter of 5 mm was evacuated from the anterior urethra . Chemical analysis of the stone showed positive minerals such as calcium， uric acid， and ammonium. The rest of the kidney stones were treated conservatively with hydration and adequate fluid intake and is still being observed. The metabolic evaluation was performed for further examination， and the result was normal.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Urolithiasis of infants is found predominantly in male children.1Positive family history is considered to be an essential factor in the diagnosis of urolithiasis， while metabolic imbalances are the most common risk factors for the development of urolithi-asis in the first year of life. The significant metabolic abnor-malities include： hypercalciuria， hypocitraturia， hyperoxaluria， hyperuricosuria， and cystinuria the formation of neonatal kidney stones may be a result of diseases such as maternal hy-perparathyroidism， vitamin D intoxication and therapies such as diuretics while neonatal disease such as hyperparathyroidism， hypothyroidism， idiopathic hypercalciuria， renal tubular acido-sis， inborn errors of metabolism and steroid or diuretic ther-apy may also have a significant role. In this case， there was no family history of urolithiasis， but positive consumption of antithyroid medication was revealed to treat maternal hyper-thyroid. Hyperthyroid may have a contributing factor in the development of renal stone. It increases the bone turn over， thus may cause hypercalcemia which can lead to hypercalciuria.\n\n【7】Distal Renal Tubular Acidosis (DRTA) which may be a mani-festation of hyperthyroid due to metabolic disturbances or as an inherited autosomal recessive pathology may have an essential role in stone development. In Chronic DRTA， there is an increase in citrate reabsorption at the proximal tubules leading to hypoci-traturia. Citrate is known as an inhibitor of stone formation bydirectly inhibiting spontaneous nucleation of calcium oxalate. This condition may be inherited leading to autosomal recessive distal RTA. The parathyroid hormone has a leading role in the regulation of calcium and phosphor in the extracellular fluid. An overactive parathyroid gland may lead to the formation of kidney stones in about one percent of patients with Ca-stones. The stones revealed are either Ca-oxalate or Ca-phosphates. Hy-perparathyroid at some extent may lead to hypercalcemia thus hypercalcuria. This condition may also increase phosphate excre-tion in the urine. Despite the fact described above，hypothy-roid will lead to the decreased glomerular filtration rate which may cause decreased urine output and renal water excretion.\n\n【8】Maternal hyperthyroid may affect newborn thyroid hormone metabolism and may induce neonatal hypothyroid. Two simi-lar drugs namely Methimazole (MMI) and PTU may cross the placenta thus may aid in the development of fetal and neonatal hypothyroidism. The hypothyroid condition may have a significant role in the development of nephrolithiasis. The pos-tulated mechanism of hyper and hypothyroidism in stone for-mation is said to be that the intact mitochondria can accumulate calcium against the concentration gradient as an active process， in the proximal or distal renal tubular cell. In hypothyroidism， this will lead to high intracytoplasmic calcium concentrations predisposing to nephrocalcinosis which is a predisposing factor for the development of nephrolithiasis.\n\n【9】The presenting signs and symptom of pediatric stone are different from those in adults. Flank pain with or without hema-turia being the main complaint in adults are difficult to evaluate in children， especially in infants. According to several works of literature， presenting symptoms of infantile urolithiasis are dysuria presenting with irritability， abdominal colic， passing of stones， macroscopic and microscopic hematuria， penile oedema， enuresis， vomiting and anorexia.\n\n【10】The anterior urethra is the most frequent site of obstruc-tion. As in this case， the patient presented with acute urinary retention and a palpated stone in the anterior urethra. In the presence of urethral calculi， plain abdominal radiography and ultrasonography may identify the stones and asses the impact of obstruction on the upper urinary tract. Abdominal radiogra-phy may not reveal calcifications， but on the other hand abdom-inal ultrasonography may well define bilateral nephrolithiasiswithout hydronephrosis on both sides. The most common loca-tion of stone presentation is the lower pole. As seen in this case， one side of the kidney had stones in the lower pole.\n\n【11】There are two types of urethral calculi/stones namely pri-mary (when formed within the urethra due to some anatomical defect) or secondary when stones from the upper urinary tract or bladder get lodged into the urethra. According to the above findings of the patient and supported by literature， this may explain that the urethral stone of this patient originates mainly from the kidney.\n\n【12】Leucocytes， nitrite， and leucocytes esterase may detect the presence of infection in the urine.  It is well understood that Urinary tract infection may cause urolithiasis. On the other hand stone formation may itself predispose urinary tract infection. Urinalysis from the patient revealed urine infection. Obstructed stone in the urethra may lead to urine stasis contributing to progression of urine infection.\n\n【13】Stone analysis of this patient was performed and revealed positive calcium， uric acid， and ammonium. While there seems to be an increased incidence of pediatric urolithiasis， urethral stone accounts for 0.3% of all urolithiasis in the pediatric age group. These stones are mainly constituted of urates and or triple (Ammonium， Magnesium， and Calcium) phosphates  which is similar to our case.\n\n【14】Stones have the varying composition of salts， where the most common found in children are calcium oxalate， followed by calcium phosphate. Calcium oxalate stones are commonly reported as the most common type of stones. To ascertain factors that predispose stone formation thus metabolic and elec-trolyte assessment should be considered. Although we found calcium and uric acid in the stone， the metabolic evaluation revealed no primary metabolic abnormality present in this case.\n\n【15】The management of renal stones in infants is not well defined， but it is essential to determine the specific cause and fundamen-tal pathology. Kidney stones of less than 0.7cm and 0.5cm may pass on its own in 24-50% and >60% of cases respectively， there-for by determining the stone size this should enable the surgeon to manage by careful waiting in most cases should there be no complication nor emergencies such as urinary retention in order to prevent renal failure. In cases where stone measure-ments are more than 0.7cm，a positive metabolic abnormalities such as hyperuricosuria， stone formation containing struvite and cystine， and accompanying urinary tract abnormalities such as uteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction or ureterovesical junc-tion (UVJ) obstruction， this will further need the combination of sonography evaluation， medical treatment， or surgical inter-vention to prevent recurrence and further complication. The fact that the was a passage of a stone found in the urethra， no renal anomaly by abdominal sonography， and no cysteine or sturvit observed in the stone composition， after an open surgery by dorsal meatotomy was performed， we preferred conserva-tive management for the remaining kidney stones by watchful observation.\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】Infantile urolithiasis is a rare condition especially in well-developed countries， but the probability of urolithiasis should be kept in mind， and these children should undergo renal ultra-sonography examination so early diagnosis and prompt treat-ment can be made to prevent further complication. Recent studies reveal several risk factors for the development of infan-tile urolithiasis including metabolic factor as the most commoncause. Although recurrence is lower than in adults， prompt evaluation and control of the risk factors are needed to prevent further complications and maintain quality of both kidneys.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Tooth infection is often derived from bacteria associated with the abscess. Canina fossa abscesses can lead to the development of secondary abscesses， infection of incisors and canines in the upper jaw and， maxillary sinusitis infection. Odontogenic infections can easily spread throughout the muscles and the face， which can cause abscesses vestibular or accumulation of pus in the eyelid and face. This paper aimed to expose the guideline treatment of Canina fossa abscesses as a complication of odontogenic infection. Case report： A 36-Year-old Patient experienced a history of pain and fever. Physical examination showed enlargement and swelling of the right cheek， and panoramic radiographs appear radiolucent on the apex of tooth tip12. Treatment included an intraoral drainage incision at the apex of tooth 12 and continued administration of antibiotic therapy. Conclusion： Successful treatments require early recognition， determination of etiological factors， appropriate medical and surgical management， and proper wound healing.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Canina fossa Abscess， Odontogenic Infection， Modern dressing， drainage incision\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Odontogenic infections are the most commonly encountered infections and a worldwide problem the main reason for seek-ing proper dental care. Odontogenic infection can develop from damaged teeth， trauma to the root area of teeth， pathogens in the mouth， or the presence of inflammatory mediators that rapidly infiltrate nearby areas， such as submandibular Trigonum or Fossa Canina This can lead to the formation of fluids in soft tissues and abscess formation. In the case of a Fossa Canina abscess， the formation of fluids can extend into the cranial region. Periorbital abscess and intracranial abscess are the most common and familiar symptoms when an infection is increased.\n\n【4】Odontogenic infections are common and can become a dan-gerous health problem when life-threatening complications oc-cur. These infections can spread through the bone and perios-teum against nearby structures， increasing the risk of septicemia and death for affected patients A\\]. Canina Fossa abscess is an odontogenic infection that can cause these life-threatening complications. The results of a study conducted by Mathew et al. showed that 16% of odontogenic infections are in the Fossa Can-ina space and the main source of these infections is an infection of the pulp (70.8%). The signs and symptoms that accompany this type of infection include swelling， pain， trismus， fever， dys-phagia， and pus expenditure. Canine fossa abscess is one of the odontogenic infections located in the small space between the elevator labii superior and the levator anguli oris muscles. The common etiology from infected root canals of premolars and es-pecially those canines of the maxilla are considered responsible for the development of abscesses the canine fossa.  The role of management by determining the severity of infection， evaluating the host defence， surgical management with incision drainage at Vestibulum of tooth 12 region， administering antibi-otics， and periodic evaluation of patients are the main routes of odontogenic infection management. \n\n【5】The treatment of skin wounds is a key research domain ow-ing to the important functional and aesthetic role of this tissue. When the skin is impaired， bacteria can soon infiltrate into un-derlying tissues， which can lead to life-threatening infections. Consequently， effective treatments are necessary to deal with such pathological conditions. Recently， wound dressings loaded with antimicrobial agents have emerged as viable options to reduce wound bacterial colonization and infection， to improve the healing process.\n\n【6】This study reports the unusual case of canine fossa abscess due to odontogenic infection. Early diagnosis combined with extensive surgical debridement， appropriate broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic， and wound treatment is essential for success-ful treatment.\n\n【7】Case report\n\n【8】A 36-vear-old male patient came to the emergency ward of Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital， complained about swelling on the right side of his face. The complaint arose 1 week and had spread under the eyes. The patient had a History take that revealed a toothache of a posterior right upper tooth. He visited a dentist and was only prescribed analgesia and antibiotic. Due to unsubsidized complaints， she was then presented to Dr.Hasan Sadikin general hospital emergency department.\n\n【9】Clinical examination showed no other compromised sys-temic condition， no evidence of difficulty in swallowing or voice change. The Patient was fully alert with stable vital signs， pain， and fever. On presentation， there was an asymmetrical face with swelling at the right upper jaw extended to the right cheek. The swelling was 10x 7 x5 cm in size， localized， redness in color， warm， fluctuant， tenderness， and pain on palpation was noticed. On intraoral examination， it was found that the patient had poor oral hygiene， and there were multiple caries， mouth opening around 4 mm.\n\n【10】From laboratory findings， we found there was leukocytosis. Panoramic radiographic images showed a radiolucent appear-ance of the apex’s tip at tooth 12，16 and silicone drain placement.\n\n【11】We diagnosed the patient with canine fossa Abscess due to gangrene pulp of tooth 12. We performed administered antibi-otics (Amoxicillin and Metronidazole 500 mg) and mefenamic acid 500 mg. Before the surgical intervention， pus aspiration was performed to ensure the location of the pus and check for antibacterial resistance and sensitivity. The treatment performed was an intraoral drainage incision at the apex area of tooth 12 for pus drainage， and silicone drain placement for pus access figure4. extraction of teeth 16，12，36 to control the source of infection， and we checked culture sensitivity and antibacterial resistance. A fistula at the infraorbital region was determined after treat-ment performed and it would be follow up postoperatively to avoid further complication.\n\n【12】1 until 3 days post-operatively the fistula was seen， there were signs dry wound at the infraorbital region. Wounds are packed with a modern dressing using polihexanide， cadexomer iodine0，9%， and polyurethane foam which is changed frequently. The wound bed was kept moist to allow for easier proper healing. As long as 3 months follow up， the improvement was significant the patient was satisfied with the treatment.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Most infections originate in the mandible and jaw bone of the odontogenic source and are usually caused by periapical in-fections， periodontal infections， cysts， root residues， remaining infections， Pericoronal pockets others. The causes and diagnoses of serious odontogenic infections， as well as their propensity to spread， have been described extensively in the literature. Fossa Canina abscess is one type of odontogenic infection with several trigger factors that may be associated with dental caries， peri-apical or periodontal abscess， pericoronitis， pulpitis， or osteitisOrofacial infection can spread in several ways， such as di-rectly through the tissues， through the lymphatic system to the regional lymph nodes and into the bloodstream， or directly through the bloodstream. The spread of infection to the Fossa Canina usually arises from the maxillary canine teeth or other anterior teeth and the upper premolar teeth， often seen above the buccinator muscle.From clinical examinations， in this case， signs of extension of infection to the infraorbital region were spread through the canine fossa as characterized by abscesses of the canine fossa， which was spread ascending to the infraorbital region. Patients had a history of upper right toothache， and pulp gangrene was found in the right upper quadrant. Extraction of all gangrenous pulp gangrene， radices teeth， and drainage incisions in the intraoral canine fossa area was carried out. Spontaneous drainage from the tooth socket 12was extracted，so it was concluded that the canine fossa abscess extending to the infraorbital region was due to tooth 12.\n\n【15】There is a risk the infection can spread to the cranial through the external angle of the vein and lead to thrombosis. Further complications， in this case， one of which is the blindness that causes orbital cellulitis. Panoramic radiographic results show radiolucent appearance in the apex region of tooth 12. Radio-graphic examination is an important component of dental man agement because periapical， occlusal， and panoramic radiogra-phy can provide the necessary information. \n\n【16】The results of a study conducted by Mathew et al. showed that 16% of odontogenic infections are in the Fossa Canina space and the main source of these infections is an infection of the pulp(70.8%). The signs and symptoms that accompany this type of infection include swelling， pain， trismus， fever， dysphagia， and pus expenditure. \n\n【17】An odontogenic infection is a polymicrobial infection caused by a combination of anaerobic bacterial species， specifically fac-ultative anaerobes and anaerobes. Dental and medical practition-ers have an important role in the management of odontogenic infections. They can treat patients with only antibiotics. High doses should be started empirically. Empirical antibiotics were given after waiting for the results of pus culture and antibi-otic sensitivity. The results of the culture found gram-positive coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) bacteria. This result is consistent with the research conducted by Teweldemedhin et al. that coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are one of the bacteria that is often found on the ocular surface of the eye.5 From the results of antibiotic sensitivity cultures， sensitive results were found in all antibiotics classes， and thus ceftriaxone and metronidazole administration is appropriate.  Immediate broad-spectrum antibiotics can be modified once culture results are obtained， and surgical debridement of the lesion is the key to a good prognosis. All necrotic tissue must be removed， and after the surgical debridement， wounds are packed with modern dressing， which is changed frequently.\n\n【18】The modern wound dressing material， in this case， is polyurethane foam， polihexanide， and cadexomer iodine. The unhealthy margins were removed during each exposure for the wound dressing； the wound bed was kept moist to allow for easier epidermal migration and neoangiogenesis. Once the infec-tion has resolved， the overlying skin eventual begins to adhere to the underlying fascia， and any areas of skin loss as a result of gangrene can be grafted temporarily with porcine skin\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】Canine fossa abscess must be recognized and treated quickly and precisely to prevent it from further complications， one of which is the blindness that causes orbital cellulitis. The success of treatment requires early recognition， determination of etio-logical factors， appropriate medical and surgical management， including a proper wound treatment is followed by intensive supportive care and modern wound resurfacing. In this case， the patient difficulty opening eyes and fistula at the infraorbital region due to Canine fossa abscess， but the patient experienced a significant improvement due to immediate management to prevent the spread of infection and further complications.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "10076bba-6534-49d2-b9de-e23572272c61", "title": null, "text": "【0】ABSTRACT Introduction： Selenium binding protein 1 (SBP1) is a cytosolic protein， and a low serum level of SBP1 is a marker for women at risk of ovarian failure and infertility. The aim of this study is to meet the need for a marker that can be used in the clinic as an alternative to anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) in primary infertile patients. Materials and Methods： A total of 82 women， 63 in the study and 19 in the control groups， were included in the study. On the 2nd or 3rd days of the menstruation， patients were examined with transvaginal sonography (TVS)， and the number of antral follicles(AFs) was calculated. Then， laboratory blood samples were taken to measure AMH， SBP1， FSH， LH， E2， prolactin and TSH values. Results： SBP1 levels were similar in the study and control groups. No statistically significant relationship was found between SBP1 and AMH， AFs， BMI， age， pregnancy outcome， FSH，LH， E2 parameters. Measures in which the success of distinguishing individuals from the study group and the control group were significant were found only as age and AMH variables. Conclusions： AMH shows the number of primordial follicles， provides information about the health status of the ovarian tissue， and the serum level of AMH decreases with years， and there is a weak relation with SBP1 and these values， but there is a statistically insignificant relationship， information about ovarian tissue such as AMH； these also suggest that women can use it as an ovarian reserve test regardless of their cycle.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS primary infertility， selenium binding protein 1， anti-mullerian hormone， antral follicle count， pregnancy.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Infertility is the clinical condition that defines a couple’s inability to conceive for 12 months and longer when the woman is below35 vears， and 6 months and more when she is over 35 years， despite unprotected and regular sexual intercourse. Coupleswho have not had a pregnancy before are called primary infer-tile， and couples who previously had a pregnancy are called secondary infertile . Infertility with normal ovulation， normal tubal patency and uterine cavity， normal semen analysis， and sufficient ovarian reserve is called \"unexplained infertility\". Unexplained infertility can be diagnosed in up to 15-30% of in-fertile couples . In the evaluation of infertile couples， the first evaluation including a complete medical history and physical examination， should be performed. Basal hormone levels in infertile couples， especially in menstruation 2nd or 3rd days， follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)， luteinizing hormone (LH) and estradiol (E2) should be analyzed. Both ovaries and antral follicles (AFs) should be evaluated by transvaginal sonography(TVS) in patients. By determining the serum anti-Mullerian hor-mone (AMH) value the progesterone level on the 22nd day ofmenstruation in the same cycle of the female individual for the couple with the help of the laboratory， the first road map for follow-up and treatment is determined .\n\n【4】Anti-Mullerian hormone； is made by granulosa cells in small antral and pre-antral follicles and can be correlated with ovarian reserve， ovarian function， regular menstrual cycle， in practice. In infertile women， AMH is a predictive tool for ovarian response to stimulation of gonadotropin hormone， but it does not reflect the possibility of pregnancy . Serum AMH levels are inversely proportional to age， but it remains relatively con-stant throughout the menstrual cycle and can be measured at any time . Normal AMH values are between 1-3 ng/ml in women of reproductive age. While low values such as 0.2-0.7ng/ ml predict that ovarian stimulation will be unsuccessful， it still does not provide sufficient information about the possibility of pregnancy . In pregnancy， serum AMH levels are mea-sured low due to suppression of follicle formation. In patients with polycystic over syndrome (PCOS)， AMH values are found approximately 2-3 times increased. Although it is argued that high body mass index (BMI) decreases AMH levels， it is claimed that the main factor is the age， not obesity. There are discussions about the qualitative benefit of AMH .\n\n【5】It was observed that the ovarian reserve predicted with ma-ternal serum AMH values correlated closely with the number of AFs detected in the early follicular phase with TVS. However， the correlation was valid in AFs counts with follicles classified as small and medium； in cases where the follicles over 6 mm are dominant， it is claimed that the correlation between the number of AFs and AMH has disappeared . In studies conducted， it was observed that there was a correlation with the AFs count and the number of primordial follicles . The AFs count also decreases in a woman approaching menopause and in individ-uals with poor ovarian reserve. However， the reliability of the number of AFs in evaluating the ovarian reserve is very low. For this reason， it is not used alone in evaluating the ovarian reserve and it is correlated with other parameters.\n\n【6】Selenium binding protein 1 (SBP1) is a cytosolic protein which partially characterized in 1989. SBP1 is different from other proteins containing selenium in selenium binding mode. For example， while glutathione peroxidase， thioredoxin reductase， and other enzymes are proteins containing selenocysteine， SBP1is assumed to be common. In cases of infertility， serous ovarian cancer， endometriosis，anovulation，PCOS， premature ovarian failure and other conditions where ovarian tissue is affected， auto-antibodies against SBP1 are seen and serum levels of SBP1decrease . Low serum level of SBP1 is a marker for women at risk of ovarian failure. In addition， it was observed that the amount of selenium decreased in primary oocyte fluid content in women whose cause was not explained and received IVF treatment . That’s why， it is claimed that SBP1 serum levels can be used in unexplained infertility .\n\n【7】The aim of this study is to meet the need for a marker that can be used in the clinic as an alternative to AMH in primary infertile patients. While the AFs count is used in the evaluation of the ovaries or the course of treatment in women receiving infertility treatment， the evaluation of SBP1 serum levels as a correlation with AMH or as an alternative marker has been the subject of this research.\n\n【8】Materials and Methods\n\n【9】Study design and participant population\n\n【10】In this study， participants were selected from the patients who applied to our IVF Center between 05.2018 and 05.2019. A total of 82 women， 63 in the study group and 19 in the control group， were included in the study. In both groups， women between the ages of 20 and 40 were selected.\n\n【11】Inclusion criteria\n\n【12】As the study group； female patients； who has not been able to get pregnant even before， without a tubal or uterine disorder in hysterosalpingography， and whose sperm test were evalu-ated normal， who had no problem in the evaluation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian hormonal axis， did not undergo ovarian surgery previously， no thyroid dysfunction， and who do not take anti-inflammatory drugs， were included in the study. As a control group， women who had a pregnancy before and brought it to term and gave birth to a live baby even once， who did not have a chronic ovarian disease and did not undergo ovarian surgery， whose ovaries were not removed for any rea-son， who did not receive anti-inflammatory treatment， who did not have thyroid disease， who women with a normal hormone test on 2nd or 3rd days of menstruation， were included in the study.\n\n【13】Data collection\n\n【14】Personal information of the patients was recorded in their first application at the clinic. Physical examinations of patients were performed and menstrual periods， patients and families' genetic histories， and BMIs were recorded. On the 2nd or 3rd days of the menstruation， patients were examined with their TVS probe (7.2MHz， Toshiba Xario 100， Japan) in the outpatient clinic while in the lithotomy position. Then， laboratory blood samples were taken to measure AMH，SBP1， FSH， LH， E2， prolactin and TSH values. The samples taken for AMH， SBP1 was centrifuged within 10 minutes and their serums were stored at -80C. Stored serums were studied within two months. The patients were followed up with phCG values during the clinical follow-up and after treatment. As a result of (+) βhCG values， pregnancy was observed in 23 patients in the primary infertile patient group and 2 patients in the control group.\n\n【15】Ethical permission\n\n【16】Ethics committee approval was obtained from the Clinical Re-search Ethics Committee (E-18-2056) for the study. Each patient was informed in detail and informed consent forms were re-ceived. The ethical rules the determined were followed at each stage of the study.\n\n【17】Statistical Analysis\n\n【18】The statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 22 statistical software. Along with descriptive statistics， Spearman corre lation analysis Mann-Whitney U test， Kruskal Wallis test and Chi-square test were used to correlate analysis and the predictive values of the parameters were compared. Besides， independent parameters such as AMH， SBP1， age， BMI， duration of infertil-ity were also examined by ROC analysis.

A positive and weak relationship between SBP1 and AMH values in the study group (r=0.126)； in the con-trol group， a negative and moderate (r=-0.337) relationship was observed and both values were statistically not significant (p>0.05). A negative and weak relationship between SBP1 measure-ments and BMI measurements in the study group (r=-0.168)； a positive weak relationship (r=0.240) was found in the control group and both values were not statistically significant (p>0.05).\n\n【31】In the study group， there was no significant difference be-tween SBP1 values according to whether the individuals were the first basal AFs or not (p>0.05). Similarly， there was no statisti-cally significant difference in the same parameters in the control group. (p>0.05). Besides， there was no significant difference be-tween the SBP1 values according to the groups (P>0.05).\n\n【32】No significant differences were found between SBP1 mea-surements according to age groups of study and control groups(p>0.05).\n\n【33】There was no significant difference between the SBP1 mea-surements according to the pregnancy results of the individuals in the study group (p>0.05).\n\n【34】There was no significant difference between the SBP1 mea-surements according to the pregnancy results of the individuals in the study group (p> 0.05). Since only live pregnancy was observed in two cases in the control group， comparisons by the SBP1 level could not be made. \n\n【35】A positive and weak relationship (r=0.208) was found be-tween the SBP1 and FSH measurements of the individuals in the study group， and this relationship was not significant (p>0.05). Also， there was no relationship between SBP1 and LH and E2 measurements. In the control group， a negative and weak correlation (r=-0，216) was found between the SBP1 and FSH values and it was not significant (p>0.05). A negative and weak relationship (r=-0，214) was found between SBP1 and LH values and was not significant (p> 0.05). There was no linear relationship between SBP1 and E2 measurements.\n\n【36】Table 4 showed whether age， BMI， SBP1， AMH， AFs count， and FSH measurements were determinative in distinguishing participants in the study and control groups. Age and AMH variables were found to be significant in the success of distin-guishing individuals from the study group and the control group(p<0.05). In other words， the power of age and AMH measure-ments to identify individuals in the study and control groups were strong.\n\n【37】The ROC curve for AMH measurements is shown in Fig-ure 1-A. The area under the ROC curve for age measurements was 0.25 unit-square. The probability of an individual in the study group to have a more suspicious (+) test result than an individual in the control group was 0.25. Again， for significant AMH measurements， the area under the ROC curve was 0.66unit-square. In other words， the probability of an individual in the study group to have a more suspicious (+) test result than an individual in the control group was 0.66. The cut-off value of AMH measurements was 2.81 in diagnosing individuals in the study or control group. For this cut-off value， sensitivity was calculated as 0.75 and specificity as 0.474.\n\n【38】The cut-off value of \"age\" measurements in the study or con-trol group was 21.50. The sensitivity was 0.91 and the specificity was 0.947 for the 21.50 cut-off value. In other words， the rate of diagnosis of individuals in the study group was 91%， withthe “Age\"measurement less than 21.50. So， the specificity value from the 0.947 transactions was 0.053. In other words， the rate of identification of individuals with the “Age\" measurement less than 21.50 was 5% in the control group. \n\n【39】Since the BMI， SBP1， AFC and FSH measurements were not determinant in separating individuals in the study and control groups， only ROC curve values were included. \n\n【40】Discussion\n\n【41】In our study； FSH， LH， E2， TSH， prolactin， AMH and SBP1 val-ues were examined on the 2nd and 3rd days of menstruation in primary infertile patients. Besides， with TVS， on the 2nd and 3rd days of menstruation，ovaries were evaluated， and the number of AFs was calculated. In a one-year follow-up， each patient’s pregnancies were followed up with phCG values. According to our results， SBP1 levels were similar in the study and control groups (p> 0.05). No statistically significant relationship was found between SBP1 and AMH， AFs numbers， BMI， age， preg-nancy outcome，FSH， LH， E2 parameters. Measures in which the success of distinguishing individuals from the study group andthe control group were significant were found only as age and AMH variables (p<0.05).\n\n【42】Specific auto-antigens such as HSP90 ， enolase ， and SBP1  were reported in premature ovarian failure and infer-aSSay tility. In an immunoassay study， Yu-Rice et al.  reported that the mean optical density (0.72；p=0.04) and the proportion of sera positive (30%； p=0.03) for anti-SBP1 were significantly higher in infertility compared to normal controls. Among women with in-fertility， the mean optical density value for anti-SBP1 was signif-icantly higher in women with ovulatory dysfunction (p<0.0001)， unexplained infertility (p=0.01)， and premature ovarian failure(p=0.03) compared with healthy controls. The proportion of anti-SBP1 positive sera was significantly higher in women with ovulatory dysfunction (50.0%； p=0.007)， unexplained infertility(24.3%； p=0.02) and premature ovarian failure (28.0%； p=0.02)， compared to control. However， in our study， no significant dif-ference was found between the SBP1 measurements of sera (sera) in the primary infertile group and the control group (P> 0.05).\n\n【43】AMH plays a central role in paracrine control of ovarian steroidogenesis and folliculogenesis， and this hormone plays a major role in the pathophysiology of anovulation， PCOS，low ovarian reserve， and primary ovarian failure . In our study， a positive and weak relationship was found between SBP1 and AMH values in the primary infertile patient group， and this relationship was not statistically significant (r=0.126， p>0.05). These results suggest that SBP1 cannot be used like AMH in or-der to show the number of primordial follicles in ovaries. Also， we could not find any study on this subject. It was found that the relationship between the ovarian reserve and SBP1 levels was investigated very little， only auto-antibodies developing against SBP1 decreased serum levels of this protein and also this situation was not examined in terms of infertility. It was also observed that the association of serum SBP1 and AMH was not examined in terms of female infertility. However， in a study related to other parameters， no correlation was found between anti-SBP1 and CA125 and anti-p53 in infertility (corre-lation coefficient=0.07， p=0.59 and correlation coefficient=-0.25； p=0.07，respectively). Besides， anti-SBP1 discriminated infertil-ity (premature ovarian failure， unexplained infertility， ovulatory dysfunction， and endometriosis) from healthy controls with an AUC of 0.7 (p=0.001) . Considering the infertility process and its causes， the fact that SBP1 and AMH levels are corre lated even if weak， suggests that this study should be performed with the more patient population. As a new usable parameter related to the viability and health of ovarian tissue that is not af-fected by external parameters， SBP1 levels require more detailed evaluations.\n\n【44】In the primary infertile group of patients， there was no sig-nificant difference between the SBP1 measurements according to whether the individuals had the first basal AFs or not (p>0.05). A negative and weak correlation was found between SBP1measurements and BMI measurements in the primary infertile patient group (r = -0.168； p>0.05). This finding confirms the information that the increase in BMI， which is an already known phenomenon， causes a decrease in ovarian follicle quality. The inverse proportion found in this study should also be evaluated by increasing the size of the session to be studied and the size of the study group (universe). No significant correlation was found between the SBP1 and FSH， LH and E2 measurements of the individuals in the primary infertile patient group. Nega-tive and weak relationships were found between SBP1 and FSH and LH values of the individuals in the control group and therelationships were not statistically significant (r=-0，216 andr=-0，214； p>0.05， respectively).Ovarian reserve； shows the repro-ductive potential of ovaries， represents the number of oocytes available for fertilization and can be evaluated by blood tests or TVS . Although there are no strict criteria for decreased ovarian reserve， the following values can be considered consis tent with decreasing ovarian reserve： -AMH value less than 1ng / mL， AFs number less than 5-7，FSH value greater than 10IU/L， Poor response to in-vitro fertilization stimulation (Less than four oocytes during oocyte uptake . The ovarian reserve can be evaluated by measuring E2 and FSH between the 2-5-day cycles of menstruation. FSH values greater than 10 IU / L are associated with a less robust response to ovarian stimulation. Basal E2 levels should typically be less than 60-80 pg/ml； high E2 levels can have a suppressive effect on FSH levels and indicate that ovarian reserve decreases. Infertility is a problem that brings both social and health problems. Besides the known sociological problems， for example， the rate of ovarian cancer is significantly increased in women with infertility compared to the populations . Anti-SBP1 in women with infertility related to ovarian insufficiency may be a measurable indicator of risk for ovarian cancer .\n\n【45】Conclusions\n\n【46】As a result of this study； there was a negative and moderate relationship between SBP1 and AMH levels in the control group(r=-0.337； p>0.05). Although there was a low relationship in the primary infertile group of patients who had not conceived before， this correlation was considered as a non-significant re-lationship since the control group had previously experienced pregnancy. In other words， AMH shows the number of primor-dial follicles in the ovarian tissue， provides information about the health status of the ovarian tissue， and the serum level of AMH decreases with years， and there is a weak relation with SBP1 and these values， but there is a statistically insignificant relationship， information about ovarian tissue such as AMH； these also suggest that women can use it as an ovarian reserve test regardless of their cycle. However， in the control group， that is， in the previously conceived population， there is a negative relationship between FSH and LH and SBP1 and SBP1 is high in individuals with low FSH and LH indicating that the healthy ovarian tissue has a healthy follicle amount and a pregnancy in its history. Serum SBP1 is thought to be high because of in-flammation， autoimmunity， or any pathological process in the ovarian tissue that is considered to be or is likely to be normal. It was thought that this situation should be brought to a clearer and clinically usable stage by working in multiple centers.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

This case is a rare case， so it is very interesting to explore and serve as lesson material for us together.\n\n【2】KEYWORDS male， hypokalemia， periodic， paralysis， familial\n\n【3】Background\n\n【4】Periodic paralysis hypokalemia is characterized by low potas-sium levels at the time of the attack， with a history of episodes of weakness to paralysis of the skeletal muscles which are often rarely well diagnosed. Most of the sufferers do not show obvi-ous signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism， so there is often a misdiagnosis. Immediate treatment is needed to recover from the paralysis condition， prevent serious complications such as arrhythmias and respiratory failure and prevent a recurrence.\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Hypokalemia can occur due to loss of potassium through the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys， insufficient dietary intake of potassium， or as a result of displacement of extracellular potas-sium into intracellular fluid. Periodic paralysis hypokalemia isone of the clinical manifestations of hypokalemia that occurs due to the transfer of potassium into the intracellular fluid . Periodic paralysis hypokalemia is characterized by low potas-sium levels at the time of the attack， accompanied by a history of episodes of weakness to paralysis of the skeletal muscles. Hypokalemia can occur due to certain trigger factors such as consuming foods with high carbohydrate content， resting after physical activity， administering certain drugs and consuming alcohol. Trigger for each individual is different， and there is no relationship between the amount of decrease in serum potas-sium levels with the severity of paralysis (weakness) of the skeletal muscles. Patients can experience attacks only once but can also experience repeated attacks with a varying interval of attack time. Periodic paralysis hypokalemia may be familial or acquired. Acquired periodic hypokalemia paralysis can be found in a state of thyrotoxicosis， which is called Thyrotoxic hypokalemic periodic paralysis (TPP)， while familial is called familial hypokalemic periodic paralysis (FHPP)\n\n【7】Case Illustration\n\n【8】A 24-year-old male patient with a history of recurrent MRS with hypokalemia， currently complaining of weakness in the upper and lower extremities muscles. This complaint has been felt repeatedly by patients. According to the previous medicalhistory the patient was treated at Sanglah General Hospital in Denpasar with the same complaint about four years earlier， said by the patient was due to a lack of potassium. After returning frombeing hospitalized in Sanglah General Hospital， the patient was hospitalized again in Sumbawa with the same complaint. The patient is a freelance construction worker with a fairly dense daily activity. Family history (the patient’s older brother) had the same complaint but also never had treatment.\n\n【9】On physical examination， the patient appeared to be moder-ately ill with compost mental awareness， blood pressure 120/80mmHg， pulse rate 110 beats/minute，strong， regular， axilla tem-perature 37C， and respiratory rate 20 times/minute. On eye examination， there was no exophthalmos， neither anaemic nor icteric in both eyes. On examination of localist status in the right and left neck regions， nodules were found in the left and right thyroid regions， ± 1.5 cm in diameter， well-defined， sup-ple consistency， mobile， moved when swallowing and were not painful to touch. On chest X-ray examination， there was the asymmetrical movement of the right and left lungs， from per-cussion， sonor was obtained in both lung fields， vesicular breath sounds in both lung fields without additional breath sounds. Cardiac examination revealed 1 and 2 single， regular， and no murmurs. There is no distension in the abdomen； bowel sounds are normal； the liver and spleen are not palpable and enlarged. Warm extremities. Motor examination of upper limb 333/333， as well as lower limb 555/555， sensory examination within normal limits.\n\n【10】SOL right lobe with a diameter of 0.82 x 1.24 cm with a well-defined round shape， with mixechoic cystic coarse parenchyma， while in the left lobe， SOL with a diameter of1.08 x 1.5 cm was obtained with mixechoic cystic with coarse parenchyma， with suspicion of follicular-type thyroid carci-nomia.\n\n【11】On routine blood tests， the WBC image was 12.3x103 mg/dl(with a dominant neutrophil as much as 59%)， Hb 15.5 mg/dL， and platelets of 365x103 mg/dL. Initial electrocardiogram ex-amination revealed prolonged QT interval in the patient. The patient's initial potassium test showed a value of 1.43 Meq/L. Thyroid hormone function tests were found within normal lim-its (FT3 value： 3.11 ug/mL (1.40-4.40) with FT4： 1.74 ug/mL\n\n【12】Based on the results of physical examination， we performed ultrasonography (USG) examination of the thyroid with a space-occupying lesion (SOL) image of the right lobe with a diameter of 0.82 x 1.24 cm with a round shape with firm boundaries， with coarse mixechoic cystic parenchyma， while the left lobe was obtained. SOL with a diameter of 1.08 x 1.5 cm with a cystic mixechoic with coarse parenchyma，suspected carcinoma of the follicular thyroid type. The next plan to follow up from this is for the FNAB to be able to ascertain the type and determine the follow-up management. The symptomatic treatment has been carried out according to the cause and is expected to provide a good outcome. Intravenous potassium drip of 50 Meq was administered within the first 24 hours of the patient's admission. After drip monitoring for potassium levels， the value was 2.43Meq/L. After treatment， it was found that the patient's condition improved， the patient was discharged and advised to control via the Polyclinic for FNAB workup in tertiary services.\n\n【13】Discussion And Debate\n\n【14】Familial Periodic Paralysis Hypokalemia is an autosomal domi-nant disorder with several variations in which the characteristic characteristics are episodes of weakness (flaccid) and accompa-nied by muscle weakness and failure of the muscles to respond to impulses.  Familial Hypokalemia Periodic paralysis is an autosomal dominant disorder with several variations in which the special characteristics are episodes of weakness (flac-cid) and accompanied by muscle weakness and failure of the muscles to respond to impulses. This is a temporary episode， meaning that if the trigger can be resolved， the patient's con-dition will return to normal. The attack or the appearanceof this complaint can be caused by several factors such as a high diet that is high in carbohydrates， the presence of stren-uous exercise or training， menstruation， medication or some drugs that can cause a decrease in potassium， and menstrua-tion. Familial Periodic Paralysis Hypokalemia is a rare disorder， with the disorder being autosomal dominant， and the occurrence of a mutation in the short arm of the 1q chromosome in the alpha subunit of the calcium channel which is sensitive to changes in voltage (voltage-sensitive muscle calcium channel gene)J. From the references we studied， it was foundthat these episodes usually occur at the age of under 16 years， and characteristically cause a decrease in serum and urinary potassium levels， where complaints can last for 24 hours . In the investigations that have been carried out， there are data that support the Familial Periodic Paralysis Hypokalemia， but we have not been able to establish a definite diagnosis by exam-ining the chromosomes on the patient， so it is a limitation in the case illustration that we submit.\n\n【15】The next discussion on the relationship of malignancy in the thyroid with the occurrence of a Hypokalemia incident. In our review， it was found that a patient aged 56 years with a medullary type of thyroid carcinoma had a hypokalemic area. Indeed， from studies， no one has found a case of hypokalemia in thyroid malignancies because it is usually found a picture of hyperthyroidism with hypokalemia. Therefore in this discussion， we attempt to relate the association between the phenomena that we get supported by the data we obtain between the incidence of hypokalemia with suspicion of thyroid malignancy and clinical patients.\n\n【16】In this case， the patient was a 24 years old male and included in the Asian population， with clinical symptoms in the form of weakness in the extremities experienced suddenly in the morn-ing when you wake up. Physical and laboratory examinations and supported by ultrasound results in the presence of mixe-choic cysts in the rig ht and left lobes of significant diameter ac-cording to clinical symptoms during the period of paralysis and hypokalemia in patients requiring immediate supplementation with potassium chloride (KCl) to prevent cardiac arrhythmias and respiratory arrest.\n\n【17】Further diagnostic measures to confirm the cause with fine needle biopsy (FNAB)， but with limited facilities at the periph-ery， we have tried to screen and have done earlier treatment of this case. The patient's condition is currently good and dis-charged because of complaints has improved. The next step that is needed， of course， is to keep monitoring the patient's potas-sium regularly while making a working diagnosis for his thyroid complaints. By finding the cause and overcoming the symptoms， it is hoped that it will provide a better clinical outcome.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】In this case， it is necessary to investigate the cause of recurrent hypokalemia in the patient and find it with suspicion of malig-nancy. There needs to be a more comprehensive workup not only to address complaints but to provide better outcomes. Re-ported a case with suspicion of a Familial Periodic Paralysis Hypokalemia with the manifestation of a malignancy in the thy-roid field. This case is a rare case， so it is very interesting to explore and serve as lesson material for us together.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Most patients have palpable lymphadenopathy while 20-50% of the patients have hepatosplenomegaly. Cutaneous infiltrations in patients with CLL can be localized or generalized in the form of erythematous pap-ules， plaques， nodules and， ulceration， which is uncommon.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】We present the case of a 71-year-old man diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lym-phoma (CLL/SLL) with atypical immunophenotype and increased prolymphocytes (CLL/PLL)， which was treated initially after white blood counts (WBC) doubling with Bendamustine and Rituximab for 6 cycles， and achieved complete remission. The patient relapsed after 6 months of completion of treatment， with multiple large sub-cutaneous masses， proved to be infiltration with the same atypical CLL/SLL on tissue biopsy， with pathologic features indicating disease progression. The lack of similar reported cases， and the aggressiveness of the tu-mor clinically and histopathologically， resulted in the decision to treat with Rituximab， Cyclophosphamide， Doxorubicin， Vincristine， and Prednisolone (R-CHOP) as a case of aggressive lymphoma， with complete remis-sion clinically and radiologically.\n\n【4】Conclusions： We present a rare case of subcutaneous extramedullary masses of atypical CLL/SLL. The high proliferation in-dex (Ki-67) and the increase of large cells are suggestive of aggressive progression of the disease； however， no frank features of Richter’s transformation were noted. Based on this and because of the unusual aggres-sive-looking skin masses， the panel decided to treat the patient with R-CHOP. The impact of this presentation on the prognosis of the disease is not clear. To date， our patient has responded well to treatment with R-CHOP， with complete remission of the subcutaneous masses and on PET scan， but further follow-up is needed.\n\n【5】MeSH Keywords： Leukemia， Lymphocytic， Chronic， B-Cell·Lymphoma， Non-Hodgkin· Subcutaneous TissueChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common form of indolent lymphoma diagnosed in the Western world . It is characterized by the clonal proliferation and accumulation of neoplastic， mature-looking B lymphocytes in the blood， bone marrow， and the lymphatic system； these cells are immuno logically impaired . Most patients are asymptomatic at di-agnosis， 10% present with B symptoms (fever， sweating，and weight loss)， and most patients have palpable lymphadenop-athy， while 20-50% of patients have hepatosplenomegaly. Cutaneous infiltrations in patients with CLL can be localized or generalized in the form of erythematous papules， plaques， nodules， and ulceration， which is uncommon .\n\n【6】Here， we present the case of a 71-year-old man with diagnosed as having chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL)， with atypical immunophenotype and in-creased prolymphocytes (40%) (CLL/PLL). Compared to classic CLL， this case had an atypical immunophenotype (bright CD20， bright light chain expression， expression of CD79 and FMC7). The patient was treated initially after white blood counts (WBC) doubling with Bendamustine and Rituximab for 6 cycles， and achieved complete remission. Unfortunately， his disease re-lapsed after 6 months of completion of treatment， with mul-tiple large subcutaneous masses， proved to be infiltration with the same atypical CLL/SLL on tissue biopsy.

A periph-eral blood smear showed marked lymphocytosis consisting of small mature-looking lymphocytes mixed with many prolympho-cytes (-40%)， some prolymphocytoid cells (with features inter-mediate between lymphocytes and prolymphocytes)， and few smudge cells. Flow cytometry performed on peripheral blood showed a large monotypic B cell population com-prising 80% and expressing CD19，CD5， CD20 (bright)， CD23， FMC7， CD79b， BCL-2， lgD (bright)， and IgM with Lambda light chain restriction (bright). There was partial expression of CD43(heterogenous). This population is negative for CD10，CD103， CD200， IgG， and IgA， with no significant expression of CD\n\n【9】CD11c， or CD25. FISH for 11q22.4 ATM/CEP10， IGH/CCND1t(11；14)(q13；q32)， CEP12/CEP1012p11.1-q11.1，TP53/CEP17(17p13.1/17p11.1-q11.1) were normal. Therefore， the patient was diagnosed with CD5-positive mature B cell neoplasm in favor of CLL with increased prolymphocytes and atypical im-munophenotype (bright CD20， bright light chain expression， expression of CD79 and FMC7) initial Binet stage A. Treatment was initiated after less than 6 months of observation when the patient had a doubling of total leukocytic count of 220x10/(4-10x10/l) and marked absolute lymphocytosis of 126.8x10/I(1-3x10/). Flow cytometry on peripheral blood was repeated and showed a higher percentage of monotypic B cells with a phenotype similar to that at presentation. A bone marrow ex-amination performed at this presentation ， in which the bone marrow aspirate showed a marked increase in mar-row lymphocytes composed of a mixture of small， mature-looking lymphocytes (56%) mixed with many prolymphocytes(larger cells of less condensed nuclear chromatin and few nu-cleoli)  with some smudge cells and some mi-totic figures (black arrow) . The bone marrow biop-sy was markedly hypercellular (~95%)  and diffusely infiltrated with sheets of lymphoid cells， including some larg-er cells with less condensed nuclear chromatin and prominent nucleoli. Immunohistochemistry showed the lymphoid infiltrate was composed of B cells positive for CD20 (diffuse intense)， PAX-5， CD5， BCL-2， and CD23 (majority) and negative for CD10， BCL-6， Cyclin D1， SOX11，CD30，P53， and EBV. The percentage of involvement by lymphoid infiltrate was roughly estimated at 90%， with markedly suppressed erythropoiesis， granulopoie-sis， and preserved megakaryopoiesis. Flow cytometry on bone marrow aspirate showed a monotypic B cell population-91%and expressing CD19， CD20 (moderate)， CD23， FMC7， CD79b(majority)， BCL2， IgD， IgM， and aberrant CD5 with Lambda light chain restriction (dim). There was partial expression of CD43and CD200 (dim). CD38 was expressed on a minor popula-tion of the B cells (approximately 6%). Cytogenetics testing revealed an abnormal karyotype： 46，XY，t(2；7)，t(2；20)(q11.2；p11.2)，t(6；8)/46，XY.\n\n【10】These findings are consistent with CD5-positive mature B cell neoplasm with features favoring atypical chronic lymphocytic leukemia with increased prolymphocytes (CLL/PLL). After mak-ing the diagnosis of atypical CLL with increased prolymphocytes and Binet stage C， treatment was initiated with Bendamustine(first dose 90 mg/m?， but the patient developed severe reaction with dyspnea， desaturation， fever， and tumor lysis syndrome， so subsequent doses were reduced by 25%) and Rituximab375 mg/m²， both for 6 cycles， after which he achieved com-plete remission.\n\n【11】Six months later， he started to develop multiple subcutane-ous lumps on the upper limbs， abdomen， and back， which were painful， with red overlying skin induration. He deniedany fever， drenching night sweats， or weight loss (no B symp-toms). On examination he looked well， with multiple subcuta-neous lumps with overlying red skin induration  on both upper limbs， back， and abdomen； the lower limbs were spared. Multiple small cervical， axillary， and inguinal lymph nodes were palpated， but there was no hepatosplenomegaly.\n\n【12】At this presentation， his lab values showed normal CBC results：WBC of 4.9×10/ (4-10×10/l)， absolute lymphocytes count1.1×10/(1-3×10/l)， absolute neutrophils count 3.1×10/(2-7x10/)， hemoglobin 13.5 gm/dl (13.0-17.0 gm/dl)， plate-lets count 152x10/(150-400×10/)， and normal lactate de-hydrogenase 163 u/ (135-225 u/l). A positron emission to-mography (PET) scan showed intense hypermetabolism inmultiple subcutaneous lumps. Lymph nodes were involved in the right lower neck， right axilla， and right inguinal sta-tions . Three different skin biopsies were taken and showed similar findings . Histopathologic examina-tion of soft-tissue masses (elbow and shoulder) revealed infil-tration of the adipose tissue by sheets of small lymphoid cells， with intervening areas of lymphocytes showing monocytoid features mimicking pseudo-germinal centers. Scattered larg-er cells and Hodgkin-like cells were seen. No mitosis， apopto-sis， or necrosis were appreciated. No abnormal eosinophilia， plasmacytosis， or granulomas were seen in the background. By immunohistochemical stains ， almost all the lym-phoid cells were B cells that were positive for CD20， CD79a，and PAX5， and co-expressing CD5. Ki-67 was significantly in-creased (70% positive). ZAP-70 was positive in 10% of cells. CD23 showed variable positivity between different cores， ranging from negative to weakly positive. The abnormal lym-phoid cells were negative for CD10 and cyclin D1. The large Hodgkin-like cells were positive for PAX5， but were negative for CD15， CD30， and Epstein Barr Virus (EBV). CD3 was posi-tive in the adjacent T cells.\n\n【13】These findings were consistent with the previous diagnosis of B cell atypical small lymphocytic lymphoma with significant increased proliferation index and Reed-Sternberg-like cells. The high proliferation index Ki-67 and the increase of largecells were suggestive of aggressive progression of the disease. However， no frank features of Richter's transformation were noted. The soft-tissue lesions were submitted for flow cytom-etry analysis； tissue suspension cytospin preparation showed many atypical lymphoid cells of medium size with irregular nuclear contours and less clumped nuclear chromatin. Few large Reed-Sternberg-like cells and mononuclear cells were seen  . Flow cytometry analysis on 2 soft-tissue lesions (left elbow and right shoulder)  both showed a large monotypic B cell population showing moder-ately high light side scatter and expressing CD19，CD5，CD20， CD79b， CD23， BCL-2， IgD， and IgM， with Lambda light chain re-striction (bright). There was partial expression of FMC7，CD25， and CD11c (in the minority of cells). This population was nega-tive for CD10， CD38， and CD103， with no significant expression of CD200 or CD43. Immunophenotypic findings were like theoriginal flow cytometric findings， with no significant changes. FISH analysis of 200 nuclei from paraffin-embedded tissue was performed for each of the following probe sets (Vysis)：MYC (8q24) dual color， break-apart； dual color， dual fusion for IGH(14q32) and BCL2 (18q21)； and dual color， break-apart for BCL6 (3q27). The signal patterns for the IGH-BCL2 and BCL6probe sets were consistent with absence of IGH-BCL2 rear-rangement， absence of BCL6 rearrangement， and absence of MYC rearrangement. However， an abnormal pattern indicat-ing presence of additional copies  of MYC was observed in 87% of nuclei. This abnormal pattern may be due to addi-tional copies of chromosome 8， or unbalanced structural re-arrangement resulting in duplication of the intact MYC gene. Interestingly， bone marrow at the time of these skin manifes-tations was negative for the disease.\n\n【14】He was started on treatment for high-grade lymphoma because of the lack of similar reported cases and the aggressiveness of the tumor clinically and histopathologically， initially with deb-ulking regimen with cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m， vincristine1.4 mg/m?， and prednisolone 40 mg/m² for 5 days (COP)， fol-lowed by systemic chemotherapy Rituximab 375 mg/m丫，cyclo-phosphamide 750 mg/m?， doxorubicin 50 mg/m²， vincristine1.4 mg/m2， and prednisolone 45 mg/m² for 5 days (R-CHOP) for 6 cycles， and he had dramatic improvement in the subcu-taneous masses clinically and on PET CT .\n\n【15】Most patients with CLL are diagnosed based on routine blood count showing absolute lymphocytosis， with no symptoms， while others present with painless swelling of lymph nodes， mostly in the cervical region. However， CLL skin infiltration occurs in 4-20% of CLL patients . The exact classification of the case at presentation was quite challenging as the pa-tient had a CD5-positive mature B cell neoplasm， with in-creased prolymphocytes and atypical immunophenotype (bright CD20， bright light chain expression， and expression of CD79and FMC7). After exclusion of mantle cell lymphoma， thepatient was diagnosed with CLL with atypical immunopheno-type and increased prolymphocytes. A retrospective review by Cerroni et al. in 1996 of 42 patients with cutaneous infil-trates of CLL indicated that the cutaneous infiltrates did not affect the disease prognosis . One characteristic feature of CLL skin infiltration is cauliflower lesions over both earlobes. especially as the initial presentation as described in several case reports . Richter syndrome (RS) is the development of secondary aggressive lymphoma in the setting of CLL/SLL， which most frequently CLL transforms into diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and rarely into Hodgkin lymphoma， whichis the so-called Hodgkin variant of Richter’s syndrome. RS is characterized by an aggressive clinical course and poor progno-sis ， and is rarely seen in the skin， with <20 cases reported in the literature . As an aggressive lymphoma， CHOP (and more recently R-CHOP) has been the initial treatment for CLL patients who develop RS .\n\n【16】Our patient had no frank features of Richter's transforma-tion noted in skin biopsies， but the high proliferation index(Ki-67) and the increase of large cells are suggestive of ag-gressive progression of the disease， in addition to the atypicalimmunophenotype， morphology， and the complex karyotype detected on earlier presentation， as well as the unusual ag-gressive-looking skin masses， so that the panel decided to treat the patient with R-CHOP.\n\n【17】Our case is unique in that the patient had subcutaneous extra-medullary masses of atypical CLL/SLL rather than cutaneous leukemic infiltrate or RS. To the best of our knowledge， no other cases with the same presentation have been reported. The impact of this presentation on the prognosis of the dis-ease is not clear， but our patient responded well to treatment with R-CHOP， with complete remission of the subcutaneous masses and on PET scans as shown above. Further follow-up is needed clinically and possibly with PET scan.\n\n【18】We present a rare case of subcutaneous extramedullary mass-es of atypical CLL/SLL The high proliferation index (Ki-67) and the increase of large cells were suggestive of aggressive progression of the disease， but no frank features of Richter's transformation were noted. Based on this and because of the unusual aggressive-looking skin masses， the panel decided to treat the patient with R-CHOP. The impact of this presenta-tion on the prognosis of the disease is not clear. To date， our patient has responded well to treatment with R-CHOP， with complete remission in the subcutaneous masses and on PET scan， but further follow-up is needed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Even more rare is the cardiac involvement， in cases of severe system ic disease. Further difficulties in suspicion of the disease in-clude the microbiological similarity to other pathogens， which may delay the diagnosis. This appears to be a significant is-sue， as the wrong diagnosis may lead to further deteriotation of the patients' status， and also to the performance of sur-gical therapies， that would not be necessary， if the diagnosis had been made earlier.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 23-year-old patient was admitted to our hospital with gen-eral symptoms， including abdominal pain， vomiting， diarrhea， cachexia， and fever up to 40℃ with rigors. Although the symp-toms persisted for about 40 days and the patient had visit-ed the A& E department several times， he was repeatedly dis-charged with the diagnosis of flu-like symptoms.\n\n【5】Upon physical examination， the patient was tachycardic and auscultation revealed a systolic murmur (2-3/6) at the aus-cultation site of the mitral valve. The abdomen was painful but not rigid at palpation， no guarding was present， and bow-el sounds were reduced. ECG showed sinus rhythm. A chest-abdomen computed tomography (CT) scan showed multiple spleen embolisms .\n\n【6】Transthoracic echocardiography revealed multiple mitral valve vegetations. The working diagnosis was infective endocardi-tis and after 3 sets of blood cultures were taken， antibiotics were administered (vancomycin and gentamicin). Two out of3 blood cultures were positive for Kocuria kristinae， a gram-positive micrococcus. The antibiogram indicated that Kocuria kristinae was resistant to oxacillin and despite the fact that it was sensitive to penicillin， cross-resistance to b-lactams was suspected. Also， the patient showed no signs of improvement with the medication， so continuation of vancomycin， with-drawal of gentamicin， and administration of rifabicin and cip-rofloxacin (with the indication of spleen abscesses) were im-plemented. The medication was not well tolerated， leading to the substitution of ciprofloxacin and rifabicin by levofloxacin.\n\n【7】Despite the treatment， no signs of improvement were no-ticed after 2 weeks， so vancomycin levels were checked but appeared within therapeutic range. The patient showed fur-ther deterioration and developed respiratory failure. Antibiotic administration was once again changed， this time to linezol-id and levofloxacin. Chest CT scan was done， since there was high suspicion for pulmonary (septic) embolism. The CT scanwas negative and the patient was also treated with L.V. fu-rosemide 3 times daily for pulmonary edema. A new echo-cardiogram revealed aggravation， with findings such as left atrium dilatation， open foramen ovale， and severe mitralre-gurgitation (with convergence gap)， which were not present on the first echocardiogram. Diuretic treatment led to signif-icant and rapid improvement， so furosemide was reduced to once daily and spironolactone (25 mg once daily) was add-ed. The transesophageal echocardiogram showed no chordae rupture. Improvement of the pulmonary edema was also con-firmed by multiple chest x-rays.\n\n【8】The cardiac surgery department was contacted and an oper-ation was scheduled for a date by which antibiotic treatment would have been terminated. In the meantime， PCR of the cul-ture (in contrast to blood cultures) indicated Corynebacterium diphtheriae (100%) infection， and that led to another switch of antibiotics， this time to penicillin G， azithromycin， and genta-micin， according to the microbiologist’s advice. Improvement continued (normal CRP levels) and there was no fever， but a week later acute pulmonary edema presented with hypoten-sion and signs of severe heart failure. An emergency echo-cardiogram showed further deterioration of the mitral con-vergence gap and severe heart failure (PASP 70 mmHg). The patient was started on high l.V. furosemide and was urgently transferred to the cardiothoracic department for a mitral valve replacement. A mechanical valve was inserted (Mechanical 27mm Sorin Group) and the operation was successful.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Systemic disease caused by C diphtheriae is very rare， and is even more rarely recognized and presented in the literature. Ourcase is one of the very few cases of reported endocarditis with C. diphtheriae being the proven pathogen (with PCR). No other congenital abnormalities or risk factors were found. This is also the first such case presented in Greece. Furthermore，the mis-judgment by the microbiology lab regarding the pathogen from the blood culture (micrococcus instead of C. diphtheriae) reflects the rarity and the lack of experience in growing such bacteria in positive blood cultures， as well as the possible similarity in terms of visual characteristics (both are gram-positive， catalase-positive microorganisms， with the difference that micrococci are cocci and C. diphtheriae is bacilli) . The report of this case may increase suspicion of this infective cause of endocarditis and help microbiology departments in reaching the right diagno-sis. In this particular case， the correct assessment of the cultures could have led to administration of the right antibiotic treatment from the beginning or even help avoid the valve replacement， but the evidence does not suggest that the right medical treat-ment is related to better outcome or necessity of surgery.\n\n【11】It is also important to mention that the patient experienced a tremendous delay in the diagnosis of his disease and initia-tion of his treatment because of the general， flu-like symptoms that he presented for a long time， and which the doctors failed to relate to a severe disease such as infective endocarditis.\n\n【12】C. diphtheriae does not have a particularly aggressive behavior and the manifestation of this infection is rather unremarkable. Nevertheless， cases with persistent symptomatology should trigger suspicion and further investigation. This report pro-vides a good example of such a case .\n\n【13】Conclusions\n\n【14】This case shows that Corynebacterium diphtheriae can cause a systemic disease such as infective endocarditis even under normal circumstances (native valve). It is very important for all clinicians， as well as microbiologists， to have a high level of suspicion and an open mind regarding uncommon causes of such infections. This would possibly reduce the time wast-ed before diagnosing the disease， as well as the delay in ini-tiating therapy (antimicrobial or surgical).\n\n【15】Moreover， it is important to mention that systemic diseases caused by low-infectiousness bacteria like Corynebacterium diphtheriae may present with general and non-specific symp-toms like those of this case. A high level of suspicion from the doctors is required in order to diagnose it at an early stage， especially if the symptoms persist for a long time.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "8e3517bd-624f-4dd7-8969-940234c0990f", "title": null, "text": "【0】Background\n\n【1】Cronkhite-Canada Syndrome (CCS)， which was first reported by Cronkhite and Canada in 1955， is an idiopathic， non-hered-itary syndrome with gastrointestinal polyposis and ectodermal changes including alopecia， onychatrophia， and pigmentation. Unlike neoplastic polyposis， such as familial adenoma-tous polyposis， CCS polyps are classified as juvenile type pol-yps， and malignancy is thought to be rare . We have had a case in which CCS presented complications of multiple gastric cancers and multiple colon adenomas. This study reports such a case while including some discussion of relevant literature.\n\n【2】at age 55， and a polypectomy for a colonic polyp at age 58. Family history was unremarkable. The patient has smoked 10cigarettes per day and consumed 4 go (0.72 L) of shochu (a Japanese distilled spirit， 25% alcohol by volume) per day for40 years. The patient has presented symptoms of muddy di-arrhea since approximately January 2011， and visited a local doctor upon losing 4 kg of weight. A blood test revealed ane-mia and hypoproteinemia (hemoglobin： 6.7 g/dL， albumin (Alb)：3.2 g/dL)， while a gastrointestinal (Gl) endoscopy found mul-tiple polyps in the stomach， duodenum， and large intestine. The patient therefore began attending the Digestive Disease Center at our hospital from March 2011.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】The patient described here is a 64-year-old Japanese male with a past history of low anterior resection for rectal cancerMultiple polyps found by lower Gl endoscopy， combined with the presence of associated symptoms (alopecia，onychatrophia， pigmentation， and dysgeusia)， resulted in the diagnosis of CCS. A histopathological examination revealed the gas-tric lesions to be hyperplastic polyps， and the small and largeintestine lesions to be inflammatory polyp. The base of the polyp and adjacent mucosa showed extensive edema and in-creased eosinophils in the lamina propria mucosa and dilated glands. These are typical histological features of CCS polyps. Hypoproteinemia caused due to liver cirrhosis and nephrotic syndrome was excluded because liver dysfunction， ascites，and proteinuria were not observed. Steroid treatment was not con-ducted due to the following factors： the patient was a heavy drinker， there was a possibility that the hypoproteinemia had not been corrected， and the patient had previously tested pos-itive for tuberculosis with the QuantiFERONtest， which put him at risk for recurrence. During observation， the patient wastherefore administered H2 blocker orally. Regular follow-up examinations revealed multiple gastric cancers and multiple colon adenomas， at which point the patient was admitted to our hospital for additional treatment in January 2012. A blood test revealed hypoproteinemia and undernutrition (total pro-tein (T.P.)： 5.08 g/dL， Alb： 3.08 g/dL， cholinesterase (CHE)： 102U/L)， as well as abnormalities in trace elements (Fe： 18 pg/dL， Zn： 60 pg/dL， Ca： 8.12 mg/dL， P： 2.32 mg/dL). Immunoglobulin values， IgG (887 mg/dL) and IgE (1150 IU/mL) were high， while IgA (189 mg/dl) and IgM (82 mg/dl) were within normal lim-its. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)， a tumor marker， increased slightly from 5.0 to 7.6 ng/mL An upper Gl series found a dense growth in the stomach of small protrusions 10 mm or less， in-cluding 10-25 mm type 0-I lesions primarily in the gastric an-trum， and type 0-llc+III lesions in the gastric angle in the lesser curvature . Upper Gl endoscopy found no abnormali-ties in the esophageal mucosa； however， large and small diffuse inflammatory polyps were found from the antrum cardiacum tothe descending limb of the duodenum. Several 12-20 mm large protruding lesions indicative of type 0-I lesions were also found in the gastric antrum in the greater curvature， the posterior wall， and the pylorus in the posterior wall， which led us to suspect well-differentiated adenocarcinomas . Endoscopy of the small intestine revealed large and small inflammatory，par-tially villous polyps accompanied by oblong gland ducts with low duct density for 100 cm， from Bauhin's valve to the oral end. No polyps were found in the jejunum. Endoscopy of the large intestine revealed approximately 50 large and small in-flammatory polyps with rugged surfaces predominantly in the right side of the colon .\n\n【5】Polypectomy was performed on 4 lesions that were diagnosed as adenomas in a biopsy taken at the time of the large intes-tine endoscopy. Of these 4 lesions， 2 were at the location of gland duct growth indicating neoplastic change on part of the mucosal epithelium， which in turn indicates hyperplasticchange； these were diagnosed as low-grade tubular adenomas. A total gastrectomy was performed on the gastriclesions， because there was a possibility of cancer lurking in other polyps， and if the polyps were not removed， they may have become cancerous. Intraoperative findings included scat-tered melanoid pigmentation on the mesentery and the small intestinal wall. Large and small polyps were present in the sur-gical margin of the duodenum. Blinding the surgical margin would have resulted in the possibility of an anastomotic leak， thus making regular observation of duodenal polyps difficult. Therefore， we used the double tract method for reconstruction. The postoperative pathological report found atyp-ical gland duct growth， inflammatory cell infiltration primari-ly into lymphocytes， and 4 gastric cancer lesions. All of these lesions were well-differentiated adenocarcinomas. The main lesion was well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma， inter-mediate type， 10x20 mm in size， invading submucosal layer(sm2)， positive lymphatic invasion (ly1) and negative vascular invasion (v0). The tumor showed expanding growth and a dis-tinct border with the surrounding tissue (Infiltration Alpha). No metastasis to the lymph nodes was observed (n0/52). Tumor cells were positive through full thickness for p53 and Ki67 andpartially positive for MUC5AC and MUC2 . In addition， pathological examination detected Helicobacter py-lori infection. The patient was discharged from the hospital18 days after surgery with no postoperative complications.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Since Cronkhite and Canada reported the first two cases of CCS in 1955， most cases of CCS have been reported in middle-agedand older males. Although several potential causes of CCS have been hypothesized， including infection， vitamin deficiency， im-munosuppression， and stress， the exact cause remains unclear. Characteristics include ectodermal changes such as alope-cia， onychatrophia， and pigmentation. Digestive symptoms in-clude diarrhea， abdominal pain， decreased appetite， dysgeu-sia， impaired digestion and absorption in the digestive tract， resulting in hypoproteinemia and weight loss. Depleted elec-trolytes such as calcium and potassium， and abnormal levels of trace elements such as copper， zinc， and magnesium as well as abnormalities in vitamins and immunoglobulins have occa-sionally been found in CCS patients .\n\n【8】Although esophageal polyps are rare in CCS， polyps can occur elsewhere throughout the digestive tract， particularly in the stomach and large intestine. Polyps in the stomach and largeintestine are often diffuse and clustered in dense growths； many of these polyps are sessile， inflammatory， and edema-tous.

However， the current view is that they are non-neoplastic polyps accompanied by inflam-mation， which resemble hyperplastic， hamartomatous， or ju-venile polyps. Therefore， coincidences of cancer in CCS have been comparatively rare thus far . However， since DaCruz's report of CCS cases involving coincident multiple cancers in the descending colon and the ileocecum， there have been reports of digestive system cancer complications in 38 of 204cases (18.6%) ， and gastric cancer coincidence in 19 of 374cases (5.1%) . Thus， it may be inaccurate to state that can-cer coincidences are rare. Our investigations found 383 report-ed cases of CCS in Japan from 1980 through 2011. Of these，coincident gastric cancer occurred in 39 cases (10.2%)， while coincident multiple gastric cancers occurred in 8 cases. The rate of coincident gastric cancer among CCS patients is sig-nificantly higher than the prevalence of gastric cancer in the general population . Table 1 summarizes the clin-ical pathology of these gastric cancer complications. There have been 39 cases (54 lesions) in Japan with coincident gas-tric cancer. The average age of these patients was 61.4 years；35 of them were male and 4 were female. An examination of the depth of invasion (n=54 lesions) showed that 72.2% of cases (39 lesions) were early cancers， and 28.8% (15 lesions) were advanced cancers. A high percentage of these were pro-truded type， well-differentiated adenocarcinomas (78.7%).\n\n【14】In our patient， the histological structure of well differentiated adenocarcinoma in the tumor resembled that of hyperplasia in other CCS polyps， which led us to suppose that the carcino-ma had arisen from the hyperplastic CCS polyps. Recently，the concept of“gastric-type\" well differentiated adenocarcinoma， a disease entity which is different from \"intestinal-type\"and which arises in nonintestinalized gastric mucosa， has beenestablished following the discovery of MUC genes coding core proteins of mucin， although differentiated adenocarcinomas of the stomach have been commonly thought to arise from intestinal metaplasia . MUC2 is the main mucin of the in-testinal mucosa and respiratory system， and does not show any staining in normal gastric epithelium； however， de novo expressions appear in the areas of intestinal metaplasia and in malignancies. MUC5AC， a gastric-type mucin of the cardia and corpus of stomach， is widely expressed in normal gas-tric epithelium . In our patient， Both MUC5AC and MUC2were partially positive. These results suggested that this can-cer could be classified as mixed-type， well differentiated ad-enocarcinoma. We also validated by Ki67 and p53 staining， in which only cancer cells were stained with Ki67 and p53， indicating that only the cancer cells had proliferative activity and that there was mutated p53 protein without intermediate changes between the surrounding mucosa and cancer nests.\n\n【15】In some of the reports， adenomatous changes were found around gastric cancer nests in patients with CCS suggesting that some gastric cancers may be related to the adenoma-carcino-ma sequence， while other gastric cancers may have occurred coincidentally. The etiology of gastric cancer in CCS is debat-able， regarding whether it is related to the adenoma-carcino-ma sequence shown in colon cancer or whether it is coinciden-tal (de novo). Recently， H. pylori infection has been indicated to be one of the causes of gastric cancer， and it has also been shown to cause several auto-immune diseases， such as idio-pathic thrombocytopenic purpura and autoimmune pancreati-tis. In the present case also， H. pylori infection was detected. It is therefore possible that H. pylori infection is associated with the development of gastric cancer in CCS patients. However， itis difficult to confirm the association of H. pylori with gastric cancer in CCS patients， as there are few reports that discuss the association of gastric cancer and this infection in CCS patients. Future research is required to elucidate this association.\n\n【16】Conclusions\n\n【17】Here， we report a case of CCS presenting with complications of multiple gastric cancers and multiple adenomatous polyps. Based upon this case as well as previously reported cases of CCS that presented with gastric cancer complications discussed here， we recommend close examination and strict follow-up observation at the time of onset to improve the chances of a favorable prognosis for CCS patients.\n\n【18】Consent\n\n【19】Written informed consent has been obtained from the pa-tient for publication of this case report and any accompany-ing images.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is considered the first-line diagnostic tool for detection of LVT. Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) targeting an interna-tional normalized ratio (INR) from 2 to 3 are the only approved treatments by the Food and Drug Administration(FDA). New emerging observational data support the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) as an alterna-tive therapeutic option； however， their safety and efficacy have not been assessed in a good-quality random-ized controlled trial.\n\n【2】Case Report： Here， we present a case of a 43-year-old man diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated dilated cardiomyopathy complicated with an LVT. He was treated with rivaroxaban for 9 consecutive months with no interruption of therapy at any point in time； however， he presented to the emergency department with symptoms of decompensated heart failure. A follow-up TTE demonstrated a significant increase in the size of his LVT. This case questions the efficacy of using factor Xa inhibitor (rivaroxaban) as an alternative option for LVT treatment.\n\n【3】Conclusions： This case demonstrates a failure of rivaroxaban in treating LVT in a patient with HIV-associated dilated cardio-myopathy. Good-quality randomized clinical trials or prospective studies are required to establish the efficacy and safety of DOACs for LVT treatment as an alternative to VKA.\n\n【4】Keywords： Atrial Flutter· Cardiomyopathy， Dilated ·Embolism and Thrombosis·Factor Xa Inhibitors · Warfarin·ThrombosisLeft ventricular thrombus (LVT) is a known complication of myo-cardial infarction (MI) due to blood stasis， subendocardial inju-ry， and hypercoagulable state. In addition， it often complicates large anterior left ventricular wall infarcts . LVT often oc-curs between 1 to 14 days after Ml and， if untreated， is asso ciated with an increased risk of systemic embolization . LVT can also occur in patients with severe left ventricular Sys-tolic dysfunction due to non-ischemic cardiomyopathy . The estimated prevalence of LVT in patients with severe sys-tolic dysfunction ranges from 2.1% to 7.0%， compared to 7%to 22% following MI\n\n【5】LVT can be detected by two-dimensional transthoracic echocar-diography (TTE)， computed tomography (CT)， or cardiac mag-netic resonance imaging (CMRI) . TTE is the first-line diag-nostic modality due to its widespread availability. However， TTE has low sensitivity (21% to 35%) to detect mural LVT compared to CMRI， which has a reported sensitivity of up to 88%.\n\n【6】Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of LVT， and the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American Stroke Association(ASA) recommend the use of VKA targeting international nor-malized ratio (INR) from 2 to 3 . Direct oral anticoagulants(DOACs) have been prescribed for LVT treatment， but their safe-ty and efficacy have not been assessed in a good-quality ran-domized controlled trial (RCT) . Generally， anticoagulationis maintained for 3 to 6 months， but the optimal treatment duration is unknown . The decision to stop anticoagulation is usually made upon documenting complete thrombus res-olution on follow-up imaging tests . The present case re-ports documents failure of a trial of rivaroxaban that resulted in the progression of LVT. We present a few potential hypoth-eses for the failure of the desired therapeutic effect and re-view the evidence-based treatment of LVT.\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】A 43-year-old man presented to the emergency department(ED) at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital (SQUH) in December2020 with progressive dyspnea， ankle swelling， and abdominal fullness. His medical background included human immunode-ficiency virus (HIV) infection on antiretroviral therapy with a good virologic response， HIV-associated dilated cardiomyopa-thy (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <20%)， atrial flutter， and chronic limb ischemia. In November 2019 (13 months ear-lier)， TTE demonstrated an apical thrombus measuring 24×35mm . The patient was anticoagulated with VKA(warfarin)， targeting a therapeutic INR of 2 to 3 with a docu-mented reduction in the size to 10x35 mm on the repeat TTE done 4 months laterin March 2020 . As a long-term anticoagulant option for both atrial flutter and LVT， and to obviate the need for regular INR monitoring， the patient was shifted to rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily. Other regular medica-tions were carvedilol 12.5 mg 2 times daily， frusemide 40 mg2 times daily， spironolactone 25 mg once daily， and antiretro-viral combination therapy of efavirenz 600 mg/emtricitabine200 mg/tenofovir 300 mg (atripla) once daily. He was an ac-tive smoker and consumed alcohol regularly.\n\n【9】Table 1.

A physical examination revealed elevated jugular venous pressure； diminished breath sounds in the right lung base with fine crackles heard bilaterally. In addition， he had ascites and bilateral pitting leg edema. Other system examinations were unremarkable.\n\n| Range  | Patient's result  | Range  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Creatinine  | 90 Umol/L  | 59-104  |\n| Potassium  | 4.1mmoV/L  | 3.5-5.1  |\n| Sodium  | 134mmol/L  | 135-145  |\n| Urea  | 5.8mmol/L  | 2.8-8.1  |\n| Alanine aminotransferase  | 114 U/L  | 0-41  |\n| Albumin  | 31g/L  | 35-52  |\n| Alkaline phosphate  | 159 U/L  | 40-129  |\n| Aspartate  | 212 U/L  | 0-40  |\n| aminotransferase  |  |  |\n| Bilirubin， total  | 34 U/L  | 0-17  |\n| Portion， total  | 63 U/L  | 66-87  |\n| Troponin  | 108 ng/L  | <14 ng/L  |\n\n【13】His laboratory tests  were notable for troponin-T of108 ng/L (normal reference range <14 ng/l) and INR of 1.25， with subsequent serial cardiac troponin levels unchanged. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia of 130beats per min； no significant ST-segment or T-wave changes. Chest radiography showed cardiomegaly， right-sided pleural effusion， and prominent pulmonary vascular markings consis-tent with pulmonary edema. The patient was admitted to the hospital to manage acute decompensated heart failure and to further optimize anti-failure therapy.\n\n【14】Follow-up TTE was arranged to assess LV systolic function，and it showed a significant increase in the size of LVT from 10x35mm to 27x60 mm in diameter in the apical three 26x33 mm in the apical four-chamber view. The thrombus occupied the entire LV apex， and it was quite mobile， especially the part extending to the LVOT . The patient reported that he was taking the rivaroxaban as prescribed， with no in-terruption at any point in time.\n\n【15】Considering the progression of LVT， rivaroxaban was switched back to warfarin. The patient was bridged with unfractionated heparin infusion. He was discharged home after he became euvolemic， with a therapeutic INR of 2.63.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】In this patient， despite 9 months of strict compliance， rivar-oxaban at a dose of 20 mg daily was not effective in resolv-ing the patient's LVT； on the contrary， there was a paradox-ical and significant increment in the clot burden as seen on his repeat TTE study. By contrast， there was an adequate clin-ical response with warfarin， evidenced by reducing LVT size on the first follow-up TTE 4 months after initiating warfarin.\n\n【18】The RED VELVET mu lticenter cohort showed that over a median follow-up of 351 days， patients anticoagulated with a DOAC， mainly patients on rivaroxaban and apixaban， has a signifi-cantly higher risk of stroke or systemic embolism (HR， 2.07；95% CI， 1.17-3.66； P=0.01) compared with warfarin use . In addition， some data from retrospective observational co-hort studies， case reports， or case series suggest that DOACs can be effective anticoagulants for LVT .\n\n【19】The No-LVT trial was the first randomized controlled study to compare rivaroxaban's efficacy and safety for this indication compared to warfarin. Abdelnabi et al presented the results of this prospective， open-label multicenter study at the 2020AHA annual scientific session. Rivaroxaban therapy was asso-ciated with a significantly greater thrombus resolution by 1month (79% vs 47.5%， P=0.03). By 6 months of follow-up，the difference was no longer seen. There were numerically few-er bleeding events on rivaroxaban (5.1% vs 15%， P=0.11) and significantly fewer stroke and systemic embolic events on ri-varoxaban (0% vs 15%， P=0.01) . The study provides anexciting insight into the utility of DOACs for this unique indica-tion and will need its findings corroborated within larger， dou-ble-blinded studies with longer follow-up duration.\n\n【20】It was unclear why the LVT progressed while the patient was on rivaroxaban despite strict compliance by our patient.\n\n【21】Drug-drug interactions were considered. All of his regular medi-cations (carvedilol， frusemide， spironolactone， and Atripla) were cross-checked against rivaroxaban using validated drug-inter-action tools (Lexicomp and Micromedex). There were no major interactions detected among all medications except with Atripla， which can reduce the efficacy of rivaroxaban via inhibition of CYP3A4 enzyme (class B). In addition， rivaroxaban has no in-teraction with ethanol as per the manufacturing label.\n\n【22】Patients with reduced ejection fraction are vulnerable to de-veloping LVT . Therefore， heart failure therapy， including beta-blockers， diuretics， and mineralocorticoid antagonists， was started in our patient but maintained at low doses due to symptomatic hypotension.\n\n【23】There is a paucity of systematic studies such as RCTs describing the efficacy of DOACs in treating LVT. The dose regimen used currently has been extrapolated from the non-valvular atrial fibrillation literature. It is conceivable that higher doses may be more effective for LV thrombus resolution . However， un-conventionally higher doses of rivaroxaban may be associated with unacceptably high bleeding risk. Therefore， until further evidence is available， no conclusions can be drawn from the currently available literature to guide clinical practice.\n\n【24】Conclusions\n\n【25】This case demonstrates the failure of rivaroxaban in treating LVT in a patient with HIV-associated dilated cardiomyopathy. At present， VKA is the only FDA-approved anticoagulant for this indication. DOACs are an attractive alternative given the ease of use and lack of need for regular monitoring of anti-coagulant effect. However， their use for this specific indica-tion remains questionable until more evidence is available to prove their efficacy and safety.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Concomitant PT with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is an even rarer occurrence. When ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or IDC are detected within the specimen， the management changes from wide local excision to further staging work-up， including sentinel node biopsy and radiation.\n\n【2】Case Report： We report the case of a 70-year-old presented with right breast mass whose pathology showed benign PT with concomitant IDC and DCIS. The patient elected for a wide excision of the mass with sentinel lymph node biop-sy， which did not show any involvement. The patient was started on appropriate therapy. She is currently do-ing well.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】This case highlights the importance of wide local excision for PT as well as prudent histologic examination to rule out other malignant components， as the presence of IDC distinctly changes management.\n\n【5】MeSH Keywords： Carcinoma， Ductal， Breast·Carcinoma， Intraductal， Noninfiltrating · Phyllodes TumorPhyllodes tumors (PT) is a rare neoplasm of the breast， account-ing for around 1.5% of all breast carcinomas in women . They are clinically and radiologically similar to fibroadenomas， but tend to occur more frequently in older women. These tumors can be classified as benign， borderline， or malignant， with ap-proximately 10% of tumors harboring malignancy . PT have rarely been associated with synchronous invasive ductal car-cinoma (IDC)； this occurs in only 1-2% of cases ， in which PT is usually malignant. It is even less common in benign PT. Treatment options varies based on tumor size， age at diagno-sis， and histology， with breast-conserving therapy being the preferred treatment in patients who were younger at diagno-sis and in those with smaller tumors .\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】The patient was a 70-year-old female with a history of a benign-appearing right breast mass present on imaging for 9 years. The mass had been followed with serial mammograms and ultrasound at another facility and was described as macrolobulated， likely consistent with fibroadenoma， and classified as BiRads 1-2. The patient presented to our breast clinic after her annual mammo-gram showed interval increase in the size of the mass with more cystic changes apparent . She had no past history of breast cancer but did have a significant history of hormone re-placement therapy for over 20 years for menopausal symptomsoccurring after a total hysterectomy. Core-needle biopsy per-formed in the clinic showed fragments consistent with fibroade-noma， but a leaf-like architecture was also noted， raising the pos-sibility of PT . The patient elected for surgical excision. The patient’s pathology after wide local excision showed a 2.3-cm benign PT with 0.5-cm invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) within the PT， as well as associated high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ(DCIS) . All margins were negative. The IDC was ER/PR+， Her2Neu-negative， Ki67 2%， and p53 2%. Given the findings of DCIS and IDC， she underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy， which did not show any evidence of lymph node involvement. Her fi-nal clinical stage was T1aN0M0. She was started on an aroma-tase inhibitor and received 1 month of adjuvant radiation ther-apy， which she tolerated well. She is currently doing well and does not show any clinical or radiographic evidence of disease.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Phyllodes tumor is a rare breast neoplasm， accounting for around 1.5% of benign and malignant breast tumors .\n\n【10】Histologically， phyllodes tumors are well-circumscribed bipha-sic tumors， with distinct epithelial and stromal components and a leaf-like architecture . The tumor classification sys-tem is controversial，and is based on histologic features such as stromal cellularity， atypia，infiltrative borders， stromal over-growth， and the presence or absence of necrosis. Malignant transformation usually occurs within the stromal component and is less common in the epithelial component .\n\n【11】In situ or invasive breast cancers can occur in conjunction with phyllodes tumors， and are even more uncommon， occurring in only 1-2% of patients with phyllodes tumors. Malignant change in the epithelial component of phyllodes tumors has been reported in about 30 cases within the literature . Most of these cases represent carcinoma occurring in conjunc-tion with malignant phyllodes tumors. However， benign phyl-lodes tumors have also been reported to occur with concom-itant invasive or non-invasive carcinoma， and this represents an even smaller subset of tumors. Our patient is representa-tive of this uncommon subset.\n\n【12】Treatment of phyllodes tumor is generally wide local excision. Margins should be 1-2 cm， in contrast with treatment for fibro-adenoma， for which enucleation is recommended. Obtaining adequate margins during excision of phyllodes tumor appears to help prevent recurrence， which is common in PT ， as well as to prevent the need for re-excision if the tumor does prove to be malignant. Approximately 10% of patients with malignant phyllodes tumor develop distant metastases to the lungs or brain ， which is often fatal， further reinforcing the necessity of adequate margins. While phyllodes tumors typ-ically behave more like sarcomas and do not usually metas tasize to axillary lymph nodes ， the presence of a car-cinomatous component near or within the phyllodes tumors raises the question of lymph node sampling. In our patient， we elected to perform a sentinel lymph node biopsy after her initial excision， given the presence of invasive ductal carcino-ma within the phyllodes tumor.\n\n【13】Only 1 other case report exists within the literature describ-ing benign phyllodes tumor with concomitant IDC and DCIS. Parfitt et al. described a patient with an enlarging left breastmass that， after undergoing excisional biopsy， was found to be a benign phyllodes tumor with foci of non-specific mamma-ry carcinoma and invasive ductal carcinoma in situ . This patient also had clinically palpable nodes and subsequent-ly underwent axillary lymph node dissection， which showed metastatic involvement . The patient underwent adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation， as well as treatment with tamox-ifen， and was reported to be disease-free after 3 years. While our patient did not have clinically palpable nodes， we elected to perform sentinel lymph node biopsy given the presence of invasive ductal carcinoma. We did not elect to begin adjuvant chemotherapy given her negative nodes and favorable tumor marker profile； however， she did undergo radiation therapy and aromatase inhibitor therapy. Like the patient described above， our patient continues to do well and is currently disease-free.\n\n【14】Conclusions\n\n【15】Recently， a nomogram was developed based on the ability of certain histologic characteristics of the primary tumor to pre-dict disease-free survival for PT patients . The authors fit-ted several pathologic findings into their model and conclud-ed that stromal atypia， overgrowth， and surgical margins can serve as independent predictors of survival . However，the presence of another concomitant pathology， such as DCIS or IDC， was not studied in the model. It is important to deter-mine whether the co-existence of an epithelial malignancy or pre-malignancy affect patient survival， by reporting long-term follow up data on this patient population， and to incor-porate this pathologic variance into the regression model. It is also worth mentioning that malignant PT tumors are be-coming less frequent， with smaller tumor size at diagnosis and a younger patient age. These results were published re cently by Mitus et al.， after reviewing the data of 280 wom-en from 1952 to 2007， who were treated surgically for PT at the Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Institute of Oncology Cancer Center in Cracow， Poland", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Making the correct diagnosis of IE is rather difficult because the clinical presentations and find-ings of blood tests are non-specific . Although the modified Duke criteria are usually helpful to make a diagnosis of IE， they could be invalid in atypical cases . Certainly， the presence of acute mitral regurgitation (MR) could be a clue to make a di-agnosis of IE. However， the incidence of acute MR complicated with IE itself is low . Furthermore， the case of IE in the na-tive valve complicated with disseminated intravascular coag-ulation (DIC) and acute MR occurring in patients who do not have any underlying systemic disease is rare. To our knowl-edge， there is only one previous case report， which was caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus in a 24-year-old female patient .\n\n【7】We herein report a diagnostically challenging case of IE devel-oping in the native mitral valve in a patient complicated with acute MR and DIC without underlying systemic disease. Since the patient failed to fulfill definitively the modified Duke cri-teria， only mitral annuloplasty made it possible to make the correct diagnosis.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 70-year-old Japanese female patient without smoking his-tory or remarkable past history， had had shortness of breath while going up or down stairs for 5 days. Her condition grad-ually worsened to the point of feeling dyspnea even while standing still， and she subsequently visited her family doctor. Since chest x-ray showed pulmonary congestion， and trans-thoracic echocardiography revealed MR and mitral valve cusp prolapse， she was assumed to have acute MR and trans-ferred to our hospital on the same day. On admission， her body temperature was 36.8°C， heart rate 94 beats/min， blood pressure 150/88 mmHg， respiratory rate 26/min and oxygen saturation 99% with 2 L/min of oxygen delivered via a nasal cannula. Physica! findings showed jugular venous distention， apical systolic murmur， and coarse crackles in both lung fields. However， leg edema， conjunctival hemorrhage， or other cuta-neous manifestations including purpura of the tip of digit were not revealed. Laboratory findings on admission are shown in Table 1. The patient had a white blood cell count of 9 200/pL， C-reactive protein of 1.95 mg/dL， high-sensitivity troponin T of 0.020 ng/mL， and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide of 1 464 pg/mL In addition， she also had DIC， which was di-agnosed based on the DIC scoring system of the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (score=5) . Arterial blood gas analysis showed type I respiratory failure. Urinalysis suggestedthe presence of glomerulonephritis without urinary tract in-fection. Electrocardiogram did not show ST-T changes or left ventricular high voltage. Echocardiograph revealed an ejec-tion fraction of 70%， MR， prolapse of posterior mitral leaflet P3， expansion of the left atrium with left atrial volume index of 66 mL/m? and left ventricular wall thickening with poste-rior wall thickness of 14 mm. However， no vegetation or wall motion abnormality was detected . Chest x-ray and contrast-enhanced thoracic computed tomography showed increased shadows in central parts of both lung fields， bilat-eral pleural effusion. Based on the aforementioned findings， her condition was diagnosed as congestive heart failure due to acute MR. Because acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was deniable due to the absence of chest pain and typical findings of AMI on electrocardiogram and echocardiograph， IE was the most likely cause of her acute MR and DIC. However， 2 sets of blood cultures on admission were negative and transesopha-geal echocardiography (TEE) failed to reveal vegetation or thick-ness of valves . Even with blood cultures performed4 times during her admission and the second TEE， her condi-tion did not definitively fulfill the modified Duke criteria . Subsequently performed examinations to detect the cause of DIC， such as infectious diseases， malignancies， or collagen diseases， were all negative. Meanwhile， brain magnetic reso-nance imaging revealed 2 acute or sub-acute cerebral infarc-tions ， suggesting the etiology of cardiogenic embo-lisms from mitral valves because of the involvements of both sides of the brain. Although surgical intervention on the mi-tral valve was required， control of heart failure and DIC was considered to be the priority. Her heart failure was temporally stabilized by the 39h hospita! day only by conservative treat-ments. DIC had been improved by the 94th hospital day after transfusing human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched plate-lets because of the presence of HLA class I antibody. On the170mh hospital day， mitral annuloplasty was performed in an-other hospital following the patient’s wishes. Vegetation on a large portion of the mitral valve was found intraoperatively， and Enterococcus faecalis was detected by culture of the mitral valve. Because blood culture after surgery was also positive for E. faecalis， which denied the possibility of con-tamination， we made the definitive diagnosis of IE. A course of ampicillin was administered for 6 weeks after blood cultures turned negative. She had been followed at our hospital on an outpatient basis for 6 months without showing any symptoms and signs of recurrence of IE.\n\n【10】The objective for this case report is to inform others that it could be very difficult to diagnose IE correctly if it fails to ful-fill the modified Duke criteria. In such a case， only cardiac sur-gery might enable us to make an accurate diagnosis and save a patient's life.\n\n| Complete blood count  |  |  | Biochemistry  |  |  | Blood gas analysis (0， 2 L/min)  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| White blood cell  | 9 200  | /pL  | Total protein  | 5.9  | g/dL  | pH  | 7.449  |  |\n| Neutrophil  | 77.6%  |  | Albumin  | 3.0  | g/dL  | PaCO.  | 32.0  | mmHg  |\n| Lymphocyte  | 13.3%  |  | BUN  | 24.1  | mg/dL  | PaO.  | 56.2  | mmHg  |\n| Red blood cell  | 372  | x104/pL  | Creatinine  | 0.74  | mg/dL  | Bicarbonate  | 21.8  | mmol/L  |\n| Hemoglobin  | 11.9  | g/dL  | Total bilirubin  | 1.2  | mg/dL  | Lactate  | 0.8  | mmol/L  |\n| Hematocrit  | 35.6%  |  | Glucose  | 115  | g/dL  | Urinalysis  |  |  |\n| MCV  | 95.7  | fl  | AST  | 19  | U/L  | Qualitative  |  |  |\n| MCHC  | 33.4%  |  | ALT  | 16  | U/L  | pH  | 5.5  |  |\n| Reticulocyte  | 3.8%  |  | LDH  | 317  | U/L  | Specific gravity  | 1.018  |  |\n| Platelet  | 3.1  | x104/pL  | ALP  | 240  | U/L  | Protein  | 3+  |  |\n| Reticulated platelets  | 21.8%  |  | Amylase  | 40  | U/L  | Occult blood  | 2+  |  |\n| Congealing system  |  |  | CK  | 60  | U/L  | Nitrite  |   |  |\n| PT-INR  | 1.21  |  | CK-MB  | 3  | U/L  | White blood cell  |  |  |\n| APTT  | 30.7  | second  | Sodium  | 140  | mEq/L  | Sediment  |  |  |\n| Fibrinogen  | 437.9  | mg/dL  | Potassium  | 3.9  | mEq/L  | Red blood cell  | 20-29  | /HPF  |\n| FDP  | 13.9  | ug/mL  | Chlorine  | 107  | mEq/L  | White blood cell  | 1-4  | /HPF  |\n| D-dimer  | 7.82  | ug/mL  | NT-pro BNP  | 1464  | pg/mL  | Epithelial cast  | 1-2  | /10 LPF  |\n| PIC  | 3.56  | ug/mL  | Troponin T  | 0.020  | ng/mL  | Granular cast  | 1-9  | /LPF  |\n| TAT  | 6.6  | ng/mL  | CRP  | 1.95  | mg/dL  | Erythrocyte  | Mixed  |  |\n| TAT  | 6.6  | ng/mL  | CRP  | 1.95  | mg/dL  | morphology  | Mixed  |  |\n\n【12】MCV- mean cell volume； MCHC- mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration； PT-INR- prothrombin time-international normalized ratio； APTT - activated partial thromboplastin time； FDP-fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products； PIC -plasmin-o.2 plasmin inhibitor complex； TAT-thrombin-antithrombin III complex； BUN - blood urea nitrogen； AST - aspartate aminotransferase； ALT-alanine aminotransferase； LDH -lactate dehydrogenase； ALP -alkaline phosphatase； CK- creatine kinase； CK-MB-creatine kinase-MB； NT-pro BNP-N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide； CRP - C-reactive protein.\n\n【13】Our patient had IE complicated with acute MR and DIC， which did not definitively fulfill the modified Duke criteria despite twice repeated TEE and 8 sets of blood cultures， and her con-dition was eventually diagnosed only by mitral valve surgery. Because coexistence of acute MR and DIC is an atypical and rare complication of IE， we had extreme difficulty in making an accurate diagnosis， despite multidisciplinary collabora-tion among the departments of general medicine， cardiology， cardiovascular surgery， and hematology in our hospital. Since we could not be convinced that the cause of her DIC was MR and IE， and her heart failure was temporally stabilized by med-ical treatment， we tried to find the cause of DIC first tempo-rally pending mitral annuloplasty.\n\n【14】The unusual presentations of this patient made the diagnosis extremely difficult. The modified Duke criteria have been used universally to diagnose IE . Positive blood cultures and con-firmation of the presence of vegetation by echocardiography are the decision-making points of these criteria . On one hand， 3 consecutive sets of blood cultures are useful bacteri-ological tools . However， 10-30% of IE patients could have negative blood cultures . The 2 major causes are antibiotic treatments prior to examinations and the involvement of fastid-ious organisms， which are difficult to culture . On the other hand， among echocardiography examinations， TEE is the most useful imaging modality for detecting vegetation with sensi-tivity of 86%， specificity 97%， positive predictive value (PPV) of 89%， and negative predictive value of 96% . Although repetition of TEE could improve sensitivity and specificity，thethird TEE is reported to detect only 20% of IEs. Additionally， performing TEE more than 4 times is futile and would not pro-vide additional useful findings . Among cases posing a di-agnostic challenge， 0.9% of patients who were diagnosed as having non-infectious endocarditis and underwent heart valve operations were reported to be diagnosed with IE only after cardiac operations . In such cases， histological findings and bacterial detection on the valve using PCR were extremely useful . In particular， histological examination could ful-fill the strict version of the modified Duke criteria， which isevaluated by the presence of vegetation and bacteria on the valve， with both specificity and PPV of 100% . Despite the lack of prior antibiotic therapy， our case did not definitively fulfill the modified Duke criteria on the basis of negative re-sults of 4 blood cultures (8 sets) and 2 TEEs. Finally， we could make the correct diagnosis of IE only by performing a surgical operation on the mitral valve. This made it possible to detect vegetation and perform bacterial culture of the valve， whichgrew E. faecalis.\n\n【15】Another important feature of this case was the complication of DIC. DIC usually develops in the presence of underlying major disorders including sepsis， malignancies， trauma， major surgery， organ damages， obstetric complications， vascular abnormali-ties， severe hepatic failure， or immunological diseases . Of all disorders， sepsis， trauma， and major surgeries account for about 75% of underlying disorders of DIC . Our patient was diagnosed as having acute DIC on admission. Refractoriness to platelet transfusion and uncontrollable bleeding tendency， which were apparent by the presence of generalsubcutaneous bleeding， appeared in the clinical course. Her DIC was suppos-edly started by IE in the early disease phase， which deterio-rated by a vicious circle of excessive consumption of platelets due to the production of HLA class I antibody， the presence of which was confirmed by laboratory examination. In short， uncontrolled bleeding tendency， which was improperly treat-ed by HLA-unmatched platelet transfusion， worsened her DIC. Our hypotheses might be supported by the fact that the pa-tient did not require additional platelet transfusions after ad-ministering 2 sets of HLA-matched platelet transfusions， which markedly improved bleeding tendency and DIC， promoting the disappearance of generalized subcutaneous bleeding.\n\n【16】IE on native mitral valve complicated with acute MR and DIC without underlying systemic disorders， which fails to fulfill de-finitively the modified Duke criteria， is rare and difficult to be diagnosed correctly. Only cardiac surgery might enable us to make an accurate diagnosis and save a patients' life in such cases. Our case suggests that following guidelines or criteria should never replace clinical reasoning.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

So far， although 1 case of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) with catatonia has been reported， there have been no re-ports on patients with DLB whose initial symptom was a catatonia. Here， we present a patient who developed benzodiazepine-resistant catatonia and was subsequently diagnosed with DLB based on DLB biomarkers.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\nThe patient was a 92-year-old woman who had not been diagnosed with dementia before. At the age of 91， she experienced catatonia and was initially treated with lorazepam， which did not improve her condition. Later， she transferred to our hospital and was treated with amantadine. Amantadine improved her catatonic symp-toms； however， a decline in her cognitive function was observed. We therefore explored the cause of cognitive impairment through imaging studies. We found that the patient did not have the core clinical features of DLB(ie， visual hallucinations， parkinsonism， cognitive fluctuations， and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disor-der) but had 2 indicative biomarkers on 123|-metaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy and dopamine transporter imaging. Possible DLB was diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】Our case study suggests that catatonia can be an initial symptom of DLB. Moreover， considering the plausible pathophysiology of catatonia in DLB， amantadine treatment may be the most rational choice for the condition when benzodiazepine treatment is ineffective.\n\n【6】Keywords： Amantadine · Catatonia · Lewy Body Disease\n\n【7】Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common type of progressive neurodegenerative dementia following Alzheimer disease. It is characterized by 4 core clinical features：cognitive fluctuations， visual hallucinations， parkinsonism， and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder . Recently， initial symptoms other than cognitive impairment， such as vi-sual hallucinations， depression， and REM sleep behavior dis-order， have been attracting attention in DLB . In addition， indicative biomarkers of DLB on 123l-metaiodobenzylguanidine(1231-MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy and dopamine transporter imaging have been found to play important roles in the early diagnosis of DLB including during the prodromal stage .\n\n【8】Catatonia is a movement disorder characterized by immobility， mutism， inability or resistance to movement， and inappropri-ate response to external stimuli . This condition can occur in various neuropsychiatric disorders， such as mood disor-ders， psychosis， drug intoxication， and neurodegenerative dis-orders ， and is usually treated with benzodiazepines such as lorazepam and diazepam . When benzodiazepine treat-ment is ineffective，alternative treatment such as antipsychot-ics， N-methyl-p-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists (aman-tadine or memantine)， nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic zolpidem， or electroconvulsive therapy are considered .\n\n【9】So far， although 1 case of catatonia in DLB has been report-ed， that case had core clinical features of DLB， including REM sleep behavior disorder and parkinsonism . However， there are no reports of patients with DLB whose initial symptom was catatonia without the core clinical features of DLB (ie， visual hallucinations， parkinsonism， cognitive fluctuations， and REM sleep behavior disorder). Here， we report a patient who devel-oped catatonia and was subsequently found to have DLB with-out core clinical features. The patient was successfully treat-ed with amantadine for catatonia.\n\n【10】Case Report\n\n【11】The patient was a 92-year-old woman who had worked as a dietitian until the age of 80 years after graduating from a vo-cational school. She had no medical or family history of psy-chiatry or neurode generative diseases. At the age of 88 years， she was hospitalized for heat stroke； she subsequently start-ed visiting a hospita. for insomnia. At the age of 91 years，her Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was 21/30. A di-agnosis of dementia was ruled out because she could perform basic self-care， shop， and take a walk by herself， and she re-ceived ramelteon as medication for insomnia. Three months later， she experienced stupor， waxy flexibility，mutism， negativ-ism， and agitation. Catatonia was diagnosed according to thediagnostic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders， Fifth Edition ， and the patient was ad-mitted to a psychiatric hospital. She was transferred to our hospital because lorazepam (up to 6 mg/d) treatment for 1month did not improve her condition.\n\n【12】On admission，she scored 37/69 on the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS) . Electroencephalography and labora-tory blood test results showed no significant findings. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse mild cerebral atro-phy and leukoaraiosis . The effectiveness of aman-tadine for catatonia was previously reported . Therefore， to treat the muscle rigidity associated with catatonia， aman-tadine 100 mg/d was given through a nasogastric tube from day 2. On day 9， partial response was noticed as reflected by a BFCRS score of 25/69. Therefore， the dose of amantadine was increased gradually up to 200 mg/d from day 9. On day 15， the patient's catatonia almost disappeared (4/69 on the BFCRS). Subsequently， she showed amnesia， impaired visuospatial function， and disorientation， and her MMSE score was 13/30.\n\nTo identify the cause of cognitive impairment， imaging stud-ies for DLB biomarkers were performed. The heart-to-medi-astinum ratios of 123-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy were de-creased (early： 1.31， delayed： 1.00， cutoff： 2.20) . lodine 123-N-omega-fluoropropyl-2-beta-carbomethoxy-3-beta-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane (123I-FP-CIT) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed reduced bilateral do-pamine transporter availability in the striatum . Carbon 11-Pittsburgh compound B-positron emission tomog-raphy revealed amyloid negativity. Although the patient had no core clinical features of DLB， she had 2 indicative biomark-ers on 123I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy and 123|-FP-CIT SPECT， and possible DLB was diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria . On day 29， the patient was referred to the previ-ous psychiatric hospital for rehabilitation. About 6 months af-ter discharge， she developed visual hallucinations and symp-toms of parkinsonism， such as bradykinesia and dysphagia， which are core clinical features of DLB and confirmed the di-agnosis of probable DLB \n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】The case we report here had no core clinical features of DLB prior to the onset of catatonia， and DLB was finally diagnosed using 123I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy and 123I-FP-CIT SPECT. This report is the first to show catatonia as an initial symptom of DLB. The dopaminergic system is assumed to be involved in the pathophysiology of catatonia . Furthermore， a previ-ous report on catatonia in Parkinson disease， the same Lewy body disease as DLB， pointed out that dysregulation of the dopaminergic system could play a role in the development ofcatatonia . Thus， the catatonia in the present case may have been caused by the dopaminergic system related to DLB . However， according to this hypothesis， most DLB must be fol-lowed by catatonia since dysfunction of the dopaminergic sys-tem is the fundamental pathophysiology underlying DLB ； however， there have been very few reports of catatonia in DLB . There are 2 possible explanations for this phenomenon.\n\n【16】First， recent studies have reported that catatonia can be eas-ily overlooked by neurologists . Since DLB usually pres-ents with extrapyramidal signs， catatonia may be confused with the latter . The very few reports regarding catato-nia in DLB may be attributed to the underdiagnosis of catato-nia in DLB. A second explanation for the phenomenon is that， in addition to dysfunction of the dopaminergic systems， oth-er mechanisms may increase the risk of developing catatonia in DLB. It is postulated that hyperactivity of the NMDA recep-tor coexisting with dysfunction of the dopaminergic system in the striato-cortical or the cortico-cortical pathways is in-volved in the pathophysiology of catatonia . In the pres-ent case， amantadine， which has NMDA receptor antagonistic and dopamine receptor agonistic properties ， was effec-tive for catatonia occurring in DLB. Therefore， 2 mechanisms(ie， dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems) may have beeninvolved in the development of catatonia in the present case. Furthermore， the rarity of catatonia in DLB may be explained by it emerging under the situation of NMDA hyperactivity to-gether with dopaminergic hypofunction.\n\n【17】Recommended therapies for catatonia， other than benzodiaze-pines， include atypical antipsychotics， electroconvulsive thera-py， and amantadine . DLB is associated with loss of dopa-minergic neurons in the substantia nigra and is characterized by cognitive impairment， visual hallucinations， parkinsonism， and a marked sensitivity to antipsychotics， precluding exten-sive use of antipsychotics in its treatment . In fact， we re-cently reported that quetiapine， an atypical antipsychotic drug. induced neuroleptic malignant syndrome in a DLB patient . Electroconvulsive therapy has the risk of cognitive impairment， and consequently， it is not recommended for very elderly pa-tients . Therefore， considering the plausible pathophysiol-ogy of catatonia in DLB and the adverse effects of alternative treatments， amantadine treatment may be the most rational choice for the condition when benzodiazepine treatment is ineffective. In addition， as with amantadine， it is also impor-tant to investigate whether memantine and nonbenzodiaze-pine hypnotic zolpidem are effective for benzodiazepine-re-sistant catatonia in DLB.\n\n【18】Patients with DLB who do not exhibit the core clinical fea-tures of DLB may not receive an accurate diagnosis with-out the biomarkers. Therefore， the development of catatonia should be considered an initial symptom of DLB. Moreover， given the plausible pathophysiology of benzodiazepine-resis tant catatonia in DLB and the adverse effects of alternative treatments， amantadine treatment may be the most rational choice for the condition.\n\n【19】This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Yamagata University School of Medicine.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Most cases of multiple lymphomatous pol-yposis due to mantle cell lymphoma have been described in patients who are more than 50 years-of-age . This report is of a case of multiple lymphomatous polyposis occurring in a man aged 34 years， who presented with paroxysmal abdomi-nal pain followed by spontaneous remission for nine months， prior to ileocecal intussusception， and highlights the impor-tance of gastrointestinal endoscopic examination.\n\n【8】A 34-year-old man presented with a nine-month history of ep-isodes of severe abdominal pain lasting for ten minutes， fol-lowed by periods of remission. Gastric endoscopy at the local hospital showed gastritis and the pain was relieved by medica-tion. Severe symptoms occurred at seven months， and at five months prior to hospital admission， which could be relieved by medication for gastritis each time. One week prior to hospi-tal admission， the patient developed severe， constant abdom-inal pain， without nausea or vomiting， but without remission， and was admitted to hospital for investigation.\n\n【9】The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy， and an ileo-cecal intussusception was identified， followed by ileocecal re-section with extended ileal resection. The gross examination of the resection specimen showed thickening of the mucosal folds and multiple polypoid lesions that ranged from 0.2 cm to 0.6 cm in diameter， involving the ileum and cecum， with the enlarged lymph nodes， while the colonic mucosa was nor-mal .\n\n【10】Histological examination of the resection specimen showed that the polyps contained a uniform lymphoid cell infiltrate. Immunohistochemistry showed that the lym-phoid cells were uniformly positive for the B-lymphocyte mark-er CD20 ， and also for cyclin D1 ， and CD5 ， but were negative for CD10 . No lymphoepithelial lesions were present . The diag-nosis of mantle cell lymphoma was confirmed.\n\n【11】Following surgery， the patient refused to transfer to the Department of Hematology for chemotherapy and request-ed clinical follow-up only. Currently， the patient has been fol-lowed-up for two years and remains in a stable condition. Follow-up with positron emission tomography and comput-ed tomography (PET/CT) and single balloon enteroscopy ex-amination failed to find other lesions， and no extra-intestinal lymphoma has been detected. However， a longer patient fol-low-up will be required.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】The gastrointestinal tract is the most common site for extra-nodal malignant lymphoma .Multiple lymphomatous pol-yposis is recognized in patients with mantle cell lymphoma， but is not a specific feature of this form of lymphoma， and is also found in other types of both T-cell lymphoma and B-cell lymphoma . A study that reviewed 455 cases of lympho-mas involving the gastrointestinal tract showed a prevalence of 0.4% for mantle cell lymphoma .\n\n【14】Multiple lymphomatous polyposis can present with diverse clin-ical symptoms including abdominal pain， diarrhea， bleeding， protein-losing enteropathy， intestinal malabsorption， or chy-lous ascites. The clinical symptoms for the patient in this re-port included atypical abdominal pain followed by remission. Because most cases of multiple lymphomatous polyposis oc-cur in patients more than 50 years-of-age， in this 34-year-old patient with gastrointestinal symptoms， initially only gas-tric endoscopy was performed， and gastritis was confirmed. However， no colonoscopic examination was performed until the patient presented with intussusception， which emphasiz-es the importance of a thorough gastric and colonic endos-copy examination for patients with chronic abdominal pain.\n\n【15】Multiple lymphomatous polyposis most commonly occurs in the ascending colon， followed by the small intestine， stom-ach and duodenum， and particularly involves the ileum and the ileocecal region . Although intestinal involvement with mantle cell lymphoma presented with multiple lymphoma-tous polyposis in this case， gastric involvement by mantle cell lymphoma can be diverse and include both gastritis and ul-cerative lesions .\n\n【16】Mantle cell lymphoma is derived from the naive B-cell popula-tion of the lymphoid mantle zone. Using immunohistochemistry， mantle zone lymphoma cells are negative for CD23 and posi-tive for CD5 . Cytogenetically， a rearrangement of the Bcl-1 locus on chromosome 11 due to t(11：14) (q13：q32) trans-location is found in mantle cell lymphoma， accompanied by cyclin D1 overexpression . As in this case， the histological features of mantle cell lymphoma show uniform， small-sized lymphoid cells， with few mitoses， without the formation of lymphoid follicles or germinal centers， and without lymphoep-ithelial lesions. In this case， immunohistochemistry confirmed uniform cell positivity for B-cell markers， as well as CD5 and the diagnostic marker for mantle cell lymphoma， cyclin D1； the lymphoma cells expressed the cell surface B-cell marker， CD20， and were also positive for Bcl-2 and CD79a， but were negative for CD10，Bcl-6，MUM-1，CD21， and CD23. The immu-nohistochemistry findings confirmed the diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma. In the case of this patient， there was no fam-ily history of lymphoma.\n\n【17】On colonoscopy and radiology， the differential diagnosis of mul-tiple lymphomatous polyposis includes adenomatous or hamar-tomatous polyposis， which cannot be distinguished macroscop-ically but require tissue diagnosis by histology. When multiple lymphomatous polyposis is confined to involve the terminal ileum and ileocecum， as in this case， benign lymphoid hyper-plasia should also be considered in the differential diagno-sis. Other small B-cell lymphoproliferative diseases， including nonspecific lymphofollicular hyperplasia， nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma， follicular lymphoma， and small lymphocytic lymphoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis.\n\n【18】The prognosis of gastrointestinal mantle cell lymphoma is poor with a mean survival time of less than three years. Chemotherapy for mantle cell lymphoma includes COP (cyclo-phosphamide，doxorubicin， and prednisolone)， anthracycline-containing regimens， and CHOP (cyclophosphamide， doxo-rubicin， vincristine， and prednisolone) . A variety of new therapies are now being developed for the treatment of man-tle cell lymphoma， including bortezomib， which represents the first drug specifically approved for this type of lympho-ma. Also， bendamustine， mTOR inhibitors， and lenalidomide have also shown specific activity against mantle cell lympho-ma . Because the patient， in this case， was relatively young，stem cell transplantation could also have been considered. Unfortunately， the patient refused further chemotherapy for a variety of reasons and a follow-up only was undertaken. At the time of writing， the patient is in a stable condition， which may be attributed to the limited gastrointestinal lesions and the timely treatment.\n\n【19】Conclusions\n\n【20】As this case has shown， multiple lymphomatous polyposis is a rare condition that may also occur in patients under 50years-of-age. A thorough gastrointestinal endoscopic exami-nation is important in the early diagnosis of multiple lympho-matous polyposis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Albeit rare， there have also been documented cases of central diabetes insipidus (CDI) associated with lithium use.\n\n【1】Case Report：\n\n【2】A 31-year-old woman with a past medical history of bipolar disorder， managed with lithium 300 mg by mouth every day for 3 years， was assessed for a 1-year history of polyuria with accompanying polydipsia. During her initial hospital stay， her estimated urine output was more than 4 L per day. Initial labs showed elevated se-rum sodium (149 mmol/L； reference range 135-145)， elevated serum osmolality (304 mOsm/kg； reference range 275-295)， urine osmolality of 99 mOsm/kg (reference range 50-1200)， and urine specific gravity (1.005； reference range 1.005-1.030). Lithium was at a subtherapeutic level of 0.05 mEq/L (reference range 0.6-1.2). Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed no abnormalities of the pituitary gland. Two different occa-sions of desmopressin administration resulted in>50% increase in urine osmolality， confirming the diagnosis of CDI. Common causes of CDI， including trauma， tumors， and familial CDI， were ruled out and chronic lithium use was determined as the most probable cause for the patient's CDI.\n\n【3】Conclusions： CDI in the background of chronic lithium use is rarely reported. We present this case to consider CDI as a dif-ferential diagnosis when evaluating polyuria and hypernatremia in patients with long-term lithium use. These presentations warrant the consideration of both types of diabetes insipidus in the differential diagnoses.\n\n【4】Keywords： Arginine Vasopressin Deficiency · Central Diabetes Insipidus· Hypernatremia · Lithium CarbonateThe first-line treatment for bipolar disorder is lithium . Long term lithium use has been associated with various adverse ef-fects， including cerebellar dysfunction， gastrointestinal distress， and diabetes insipidus . Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is known to occur in up to 20% to 40% percent of long-term lith-ium users and is more common than central diabetes insipidus(CDI) . Central diabetes insipidus due to lithium use， how-ever， has rarely been reported . CDI recently had its name changed to “arginine vasopressin deficiency\" and is often caused by damage to the posterior pituitary gland， impairing the secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) . Other recent-ly learned causes of CDI were from COVID-19 infection or from the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine . We present the case of a patient who presented with onset of CDI in the background of long-term lithium use in the treatment of bipolar disorder.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】A 31-year-old woman with a past medical history of bipolar disorder， managed with lithium 300 mg by mouth every day for 3 years， presented to the hospital with a 1-year history of polyuria with accompanying polydipsia. Following admis-sion and initial workup， the patient was also diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) with onset of weakness symp-toms within the previous week； it was determined that her GBS and polyuria were separate， unrelated diagnoses. During her initial hospital stay， her estimated urine output was more than 4 L per day， indicating polyuria. The patient was not on any angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors， nonste roidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)， or thiazide or loop diuretics that can cause lithium toxicity . Her past med-ical history was significant for hemorrhoids and her family history was unremarkable. She had markedly decreased oral intake for the past 3 months because of fear of hemorrhoid pain upon defecation.\n\n【7】On the initial encounter， vital signs were within normal limits with blood pressure of 118/63 mmHg， heart rate of 86 beats per minute， respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute， oxygen saturation of 97%， and temperature of 36.5℃ Her body mass index was 41.2 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed cracked lips and dry mucosa.\n\n【8】Initial labs showed elevated serum sodium (149 mmol/L； refer-ence range 135-145)， elevated serum osmolality (304 m0sm/kg； reference range 275-295)， urine osmolality of 99 m0sm/kg(reference range 50-1200)， and urine specific gravity (1.005； reference range 1.005-1.030). Kidney function was normal with creatinine at 0.62 mg/dL (reference range 0.6-1.2) and eGFR at 122 mL/min (reference range >90). Lithium was at asubtherapeutic level of 0.05 mEq/L (reference range 0.6-1.2). Her thyroid stimulating hormone， serum calcium， glucose， and liver enzymes were unremarkable. Complete blood count was significant for macrocytosis (mean corpuscular volume 118 fL； reference range 80-100 fL) and slight anemia (hemoglobin11.3 g/dL； reference range 12-16 g/dl)， which were attributed to her malnutrition. Inflammatory enzymes were slightly ele-vated with C-reactive protein (CRP) at 0.94 mg/dL (reference range <0.50 mg/dL) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) at 37 mm/h (reference range 0-20)， which were attributed to her GBS. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain re-vealed no expansive processes， hypophysitis， loss of signal from the posterior pituitary， or otherwise any abnormalities of the pituitary gland .\n\n【9】Within a few days of admission， the patient's sodium increased from 149 mmol/L to 151-154 mmol/L It was then brought down to 145 mmol/L via 5% dextrose infusion. However， her sodi-um levels spiked back up to 149 mmol/L . A des-mopressin trial of 4 pg 1-deamino-8-d-arginine vasopressin(DDAVP)， a synthetic form of desmopressin， was then admin-istered subcutaneously without the need for water deprivation because of her already hypoosmotic urine (<100 mOsm/kg)， hyperosmotic serum (2295 mOsm/kg)， and hypernatremic(>145 mmol/L) states. Her beginning urine osmolality was74 mOsm/kg and peaked at 254 m0sm/kg within a 2-h time period after administration of desmopressin. Her hypernatre-mia also resolved， dropping from 149 mmol/L to 140 mmol/L the next day . A repeat desmopressin trial (1 pg DDAVP subcutaneously) was given after water deprivation a week later. Before water deprivation， her urine osmolality was145 mOsm/kg. After water deprivation for 10 h， her urine os-molality was 194 mOsm/kg. Following administration of des-mopressin， her urine osmolality increased from 194 mOsm/kg to 362 mOsm/kg . Copeptin and ADH levels were not measured as these assays were not available as in-house tests.\n\n|  | Desmopreshntrial 2(2 ug SO  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |\n\n| Water deprivation test  | 一143  |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【12】Table 1.

Our patient during the initial trial already met the criteria for maximal ADH secretion (sodium 149 mmol/L and serum osmo-lality 295 mOsm/kg) and did not require further water depriva-tion before desmopressin administration. Following hypernatre-mia (>145 mmol/L) and hyperosmolar serum (2295 mOsm/kg) levels， along with urine osmolality <300 mOsm/kg，adminis-tration of 1-4 pg desmopressin that results in >50% increase in urine osmolality is diagnostic for CDI； if there is <50% in-crease in urine osmolality， the result is diagnostic of nephro-genic DI . Because our patient had an increase in urine osmolality by more than 50% (73 m0sm/kg to 254 mOsm/kg and 194 mOsm/kg to 362 mOsm/kg) within 2 h after desmo-pressin trials， her condition was diagnostic for CDI.\n\n【16】Before we went ahead with testing for diabetes insipidus， we considered other differentials for her polyuria. Psychogenic polydipsia may occur with bipolar disorder， but we ruled this out because her sodium level was >135 mmol/L； treatment would have been limiting water intake . Hypercalcemia may also lead to polyuria， but we ruled that out as her cal-cium levels were normal； treatment would have been intra-venous normal saline . After the desmopressin trials， we ruled out nephrogenic diabetes insipidus because of a >50%increase in urine osmolality after DDAVP administration； treat-ment would have been amiloride and thiazide diuretics .\n\n【17】After we diagnosed herCDI， we first sought out possible causes for her CDI as there are very few case reports describing lith-ium-induced CDI . Common causes of CDI include family history， craniopharyngiomas， germ cell tumors， trauma， and in-flammatory pathologies . We ruled out familial CDI becauseinheritance would have been in an autosomal dominant man-ner， and the patient had no relevant family history. We ruled out trauma， tumors， or any other insults to the pituitary gland or stalk because TSH levels were normal， and MRI of the pitu-itary gland and stalk showed no abnormalities . An unknown， underlying inflammatory pathology may be a pos-sible cause for her CDI as her CRP and ESR were slightly ele-vated， but unlikely as the inflammation in her blood can be explained by her diagnosed GBS. Although GBS can be a rare trigger for CDI ， we ruled out GBS as an etiology because her development of GBS was within the last month while her polyuria developed in the past year Furthermore， the patient endorsed her polyuria had remained the same even after GBS diagnosis and treatment， strongly indicating that GBS did not contribute to her CDI. CDI due to inflammatory pathologies is also often characterized by pituitary stalk thickening on T1-weighted MRI ， which was not seen on our patient's MRI. If there were lesions to the posterior pituitary gland from tumors， trauma， or inflammatory pathologies， then there would have also been a disappearance of a bright signal in the posterior pituitary gland on T1-weighted MRI， indicating loss of ADH storage . A possible explanation for the visi-ble bright spot in our patient’s posterior pituitary gland would be the inhibition of ADH exocytosis from the gland. Thus， giv-en the onset of this disease without a better explanation， we considered long-term lithium use as the most likely cause for our patient's CDI. As described in Posner and Mokrzychi，their patient was on lithium for 3 years and was diagnosed with CDI after a water deprivation test， which was similar in pre-sentation to our patient .\n\n【18】The mechanism for lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insip-idus is understood as the downregulation of aquaporin chan-nels in principal cells from lithium inhibiting cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) formation . The mechanism for CDI is understood as either a lack of ADH synthesis in the su-praoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus or impaired exocytosis of ADH from the posterior pituitary gland . Exocytosis of vesicles containing ADH relies on the formation of cAMP . Because lithium inhibited cAMP formation in the renal tu-bules， a potential explanation for lithium causing CDI would be the selective inhibition of cAMP formation in the poste-rior pituitary gland， preventing ADH vesicle exocytosis .\n\n【19】Current understanding of the interactions between lithium and posterior pituitary structures is limited. Despite knowl-edge about the mechanism of lithium-induced nephrogen-ic diabetes insipidus， more research is needed to understand the relationship between lithium and CDI， as the current lit erature only described 4 occurrences of CDI in the presence of lithium. Diabetes insipidus affects 1 in 25 000 people ， but the concomitant occurrence of central and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus has vet to be revealed.\n\n【20】A limitation of our report is the lack of ADH or copeptin levels due to the unavailability of these tests at our hospital.ADH or copeptin may be used as another confirmatory test for CDI. However， our patient's more than 50% increase in urine os-molality after 2 different occasions of DDAVP administration was clearly diagnostic for CDI . Another factor to consid-er was that our patient's CDI had not been resolved. At the time of this report， the patient’s lithium had been discontin-ued for 3 weeks and was not restarted， but previous reports had shown that CDI resolved after lithium was discontinued for months . Our patient's CDI hypernatremia was managed well with DDAVP injections given as needed to control her so-dium levels. We also added 5% dextrose to help control her sodium levels as needed； additionally， oral water intake was encouraged whenever the patient was thirsty. The patient's sodium was subsequently normalized to 138-146 mmol/L fol-lowing the above interventions， and urine output decreased from >4000 mL/day to 2500-3600 mL/day when desmopressin was given . Prior to discharge， she was switched todaily oral DDAVP. During her hospital stay， our patient's poly-uria was not a primary concern to manage as she had unlim-ited access to the urinary catheter.\n\n【21】Conclusions\n\n【22】CDI in the background of chronic lithium use is a rare phe-nomenon. By obtaining a thorough history， performing a de-tailed physical examination， and obtaining relevant imaging studies， we ruled out other causes of CDI in our patient， thus leaving lithium as the most likely explanation. Ultimately， more research is needed to truly understand how lithium can cause impairment of ADH synthesis or secretion. Despite this， we sug-gest considering CDI in addition to nephrogenic diabetes in-sipidus in the investigation of polyuria and hypernatremia in patients who present with long-term lithium use.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Diagnosis of extranodal RDD without lymphade-nopathy is difficult due to its unusual clinical manifestation and lack of typical histopathologic features. Hence， it requires both a high degree of clinical suspicion and careful histopathologic examination.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 57-year-old woman presented with an isolated mass on the base of the tongue (BOT) without lymphade-nopathy. Laryngoscopic examination revealed a mass on the midline of the BOT. The patient underwent com-plete surgical excision via suspension laryngoscopy with a CO， laser. Based on the histopathologic features， including numerous histiocytic infiltrations with emperipolesis and cytoplasmic expression of 5100 and CD68in histiocytes， the diagnosis was confirmed as extranodal RDD. No further treatment was required， and follow-up evaluation revealed no evidence of recurrence.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】Because no ideal therapeutic approach is available for RDD， treatment should be tailored to the clinical man-ifestations. To prevent airway obstruction and recurrence， surgery is considered an appropriate option in cas-es of localized RDD arising on the upper respiratory tract. We report an extremely rare case of extranodal RDD without lymphadenopathy in the BOT， and provide a detailed discussion of its clinical and histopathologic fea-tures and treatment with a brief review of the relevant literature.\n\n【6】MeSH Keywords： Histiocytosis， Sinus· Laser Therapy · Oropharyngeal Neoplasms\n\n【7】Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD)， also known as sinus histiocy-tosis with massive lymphadenopathy (SHML)， is a subgroup of histiocytic disorders . The disease was first described by Destombes in 1965 and subsequently recognized as a distinct clinicopathological entity by Rosai and Dorfman in 1969 . RDD is a rare， idiopathic， systemic， and nonmalignant disor-der that may spontaneously resolve and usually affects young er patients . It is typically characterized by enlarged， nontender， bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy often accom-panied by fever， leukocytosis， elevated erythrocyte sedimen-tation rate (ESR)， and other symptoms， depending on the sites involved . RDD typically occurs in lymph nodes and coexists with at least one site of extranodal involvement in approximately 43% of diagnosed patients .In the head and neck， the commonly involved extranodal sites are the sinonasal tract and major salivary glands； the larynx， trachea， pharynx， and thyroid gland are less frequently in-volved . However， extranodal RDD without lymph-adenopathy is very rare.\n\n【8】RDD exhibits a distinct pathologic feature called emperipole-sis， in which large histiocytes contain engulfed lymphocytes and erythrocytes in their cytoplasm. Despite this， the diagnosis of extranodal RDD without lymphadenopathy can be difficult， because its clinical manifestation is uncommon and the charac-teristic histopathologic findings are less prominent . Because ideal therapies for RDD are not available， treatment should be tailored to the individual clinical manifestations . We report a case of extranodal RDD without lymphadenopathy that presented as an isolated mass on the base of the tongue(BOT)， which was diagnosed by complete surgical excision us-ing a CO， laser under suspension laryngoscopy.\n\n【9】Case Report\n\n【10】A 57-year-old woman presented to our clinic with an intermit-tent and nonproductive cough， throat clearing， and a sensa-tion of having a foreign body in her throat for 3 months. Her medical and family histories were unremarkable and free of smoking and alcohol consumption. Previously， she had been in good health， and all vital signs including body temperature were normal. Laryngoscopic examination revealed a globular lobulated mass with a smooth surface on the midline of the BOT . There were no abnormal findings in the oth-er regions of the upper respiratory track， including the oral cavity， oropharynx， and larynx. Enlarged or palpable lymph nodes were not detected upon physical examination of the en-tire neck. Results of blood testing were within normal limits. Thus， histopathologic confirmation through surgical excision was required for differential diagnosis of the various tumorsthat can arise on the BOT. After oroendotracheal intubation. the mass on the BOT was readily surgically accessible and was fully exposed under suspension laryngoscopy. The patient un-derwent complete surgical excision through suspension laryn-goscopy using a CO， laser with vaporization of the implanta-tion area at 2 watts.\n\n【11】No complications such as bleeding and edematous changes were observed either during or after the operation. The ex-cised mass comprised pinkish-gray soft tissue that measured1.5x1.2x0.5 cm. On microscopic examination， heterogeneous cellular infiltration in the subepithelial stroma was identified at low magnification . There was no evidence that the lesion arose from lymph nodes； normal lymph node archi-tecture， such as a subcapsular sinus or germinal center， were not observed. In the stroma， extensive infiltration of various-ly sized histiocytes， plasma cells， and occasional neutrophils was found and the overlying squamous epithelium was in-tact . The histiocytes had indistinct cell borders， round to oval vesicular nuclei， and pale to bubbly cytoplasm. Further， enlarged histiocytes contained intact lymphocytes， neutrophils， and plasma cells in their cytoplasm， which was morphologically consistent with emperipolesis . There was no evidence of either granulomas or necrosis. The histiocytes were cytoplasmic positive for CD68 and S100 and negative for CD1a . Dispersed plasma cells were highlighted by the immunohistochemical(IHC) staining of CD138 . Based on these observa-tions， the pathologic diagnosis was confirmed as extranodal RDD on the BOT. A postoperative laryngoscopic image showedthat the mass was completely excised and the operation site had recovered well . Because the surgical margins were clear and there was no evidence of lymphadenopathy， no additional treatment， including corticosteroid therapy， was recommended. The patient's symptoms resolved after surgery， and she has not exhibited any symptoms or signs of recur-rence after 1 year with close follow-up.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】RDD is a rare disease characterized by sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy. However， extranodal RDD with-out any lymph node involvement is very rare. Here， we de-scribed an uncommon case of extranodal RDD without lymph-adenopathy on the BOT. Diagnosis of extranodal RDD without lymphadenopathy is difficult because of its unusual clinical manifestation and lack of characteristic histopathologic find-ings resulting from increased fibrosis， fewer histiocytes， andreduced emperipolesis . Extranodal involvement may be the initial clinical presentation in approximately 25%of patients with RDD， which can progress to a chronic，relaps-ing clinical course that has a worse prognosis than regular RDD . RDD can occur in any age group； however， it is most common in children and young adults， and is more frequent in males . The disease usually presents as a large， bilateral， painless lymphadenopathy that is often accom-panied by systemic symptoms， such as fever， night sweats， fatigue， and weight loss， the severity of which depends on the sites involved . These atypical symptoms make diagnosis dif-ficult， and RDD has been reported to mimic various metastat-ic cancers and lymphoma . In particular， patients with a mass on their upper respiratory tract may present with a va-riety of symptoms according to its size and location， such as foreign body sensation， dysphagia， voice changes， cough， stri-dor， and dyspnea . In this case，the patient complained of a nonspecific cough，throat clearing， and foreign body sen-sation， and a mass on the BOT was identified.\n\n【14】The etiology and pathogenesis of RDD is still poorly under-stood； however， several theories have been proposed . One theory is that the stimulation received via the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) leads to histiocytic prolifer-ation due to a disturbance of cell-mediated immunity， auto-immune mechanisms， and altered immune responses  Viral infections such as Epstein-Barr， varicella-zoster， and hu-man herpesvirus， have also been proposed as possible causes of RDD J.\n\n【15】Laboratory abnormalities are nonspecific， with leukocytosis， anemia， polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia， and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate . Moreover， imaging find-ings for extranodal RDD in the head and neck are also non-specific； therefore， histopathologic examination is essential to confirm the diagnosis . Histopathologically， RDD typ-ically demonstrates extensive inflammatory infiltration with numerous histiocytes， lymphocytes， plasma cells and a few neutrophils.Enlarged histocytes with phagocytosis of lympho-cytes and neutrophils within their cytoplasm， which is known as emperipolesis， is a common pathognomonic finding .\n\n【16】Despite the distinct pathologic findings of both extranodal and regular RDD， extranodal RDD should be differentiated clini-cally and morphologically from other benign and malignant diseases. Differential diagnosis includes nonspecific sinus hy-perplasia， Langerhans cell histiocytosis，tuberculosis， atypical fibroxanthoma， lymphoma， melanoma， and metastatic carci-noma . Reactive sinus hyperplasia exhibits large clusters of histiocytes accompanied by reactive lymphocytes， germinal center cells， immunoblasts， and tingible body macro-phages； however， emperipolesis is not observed. In Langerhans cell histiocytosis， typical Langerhans cells have irregular nuclei， intranuclear grooves， abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm， and scattered eosinophilic aggregates. Furthermore， Langerhans cells are positive for both S100 protein and CD1a， compared to our case of extranodal RDD， which was negative for CD1a. Tuberculosis has epithelioid cell granuloma with or without ca-seous necrosis， which are absent in RDD. Atypical fibroxantho-ma can share similar morphologic features with RDD， but these malignant cells are highly pleomorphic and show frequent mi-tosis， including atypical form. Further， 5100 protein is not ex-pressed in most of the cells. Hodgkin lymphoma has charac-teristic malignant cells called Reed-Sternberg cells that do not exhibit emperipolesis . These cells are 5100 protein-nega-tive， CD15-positive， and CD30-positive. Immunohistochemistry(IHC staining of HMB-45 and pankeratin can be helpful to ex-clude melanoma and metastatic carcinoma . Through histopathologic examination， we identified possible diseases that may develop on the BOT and those that need to be differ-entiated from RDD. Extranodal RDD should be diagnosed based on clinical comprehension and histopathologic examinations， and appropriate IHC staining is mandatory for its confirmation.\n\n【17】RDD is generally considered to exhibit benign behavior that is asymptomatic， slow-growing， and spontaneous in regression without therapy in 20% of cases . Because no uni-form therapeutic approach is available， treatments should be modified according to the clinical manifestations， and corti-costeroids have been preferred therapeutic options . Various and combined treatment modalities， including sur-gery； radiotherapy； corticosteroids； chemotherapy (metho-trexate， 6-mercaptopurine， clofarabine， cladribine， azathio-prine)； interferon； immunomodulatory therapy； and targeted therapies (imatinib and rituximab) have shown variable re-sponses . Surgical excision should be suggest-ed not only for acquisition of tiss ue to confirm diagnosis， but also as a propertreatment for localized RDD to relieve symp-toms and to preserve vital organs and functions . Incomplete surgically excised RDD or systemic/extensively in-volved RDD require a variety of combined treatment modali-ties . In our case， complete surgical excision was an effec-tive treatment options to prevent airway obstruction because the mass arose on the BOT.\n\n【18】The prognosis of RDD is highly variable， and more than 10% of RDD cases develop progressive or multifocal and/or refractory disease . Although factors and frequency related to re-currence or progression of RDD remain unknown， prognosis is known to worsen with a prolonged active phase； multiple ex-tranodal involvements；widespread dissemination； involvement of the kidney， liver， and lower respiratory tract； and immuno logical disease . Close，long-term follow-up for at least the first 2 years after complete remission is important in RDD patients for the detection of recurrence or progression .\n\n【19】The head and neck are the typically affected extranodal sites . Although the pharynx and supraglottis are not considered as lymphoid organs， they have a large amount of lymphatic tissue in the submucosal region as part of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) system ， which makes them vulnerable to extranodal RDD involvement. Thus. a careful laryngoscopic examination is recommended . Good outcomes have been reported in the treatment of laryngeal and tracheal RDD by surgical excision . Further， the mass on the BOT was required for differential diagnosis from ma-lignant carcinoma， as well as benign masses， such as vallec-ular cyst， thyroglossal duct cyst， and hemangiomas . In the current case， the early stage of extranodal RDD without lym-phoadenopathy was confined to the BOT. It was completely resected through suspension laryngoscopy using a CO， laser to confirm the histopathologic diagnosis and to treat， because the BOT mass would possibly lead to upper airway obstruc-tion as its size increased.\n\n【20】Conclusions\n\n【21】RDD is a nonmalignant subgroup of histiocytic disorders. Extranodal RDD without lymphadenopathy has been challeng-ing to diagnose because of its rarity， uncommon clinical pre-sentation， and lack of characteristic histopathologic findings. A high degree of clinical suspicion and a thorough histopath-ologic examination， including IHC studies， are necessary to ac-curately diagnose the condition， which may prevent unneces-sary workups and overtreatment. There are still no available uniform treatments； therefore， treatment should be tailored to the clinical manifestations.

SCAD can have many precipitating factors such as exercise， trauma， pregnancy， drugs， and connective tissue disease. Prognosis is poor for left main stem， left anterior descending (LAD) artery， and multivessel involvement， especially for females.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】We present a case of young African American male with sickle cell disease who presented with chest pain as-sociated with shortness of breath. He was found to have non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He was diagnosed with SCAD during catheterization with the help ofintravascular ultrasound imaging. Three drug-eluting stents were placed to cover the proximal LAD vessel along its whole length until resolution of the le-sion. The patients’ hospital course was complicated by an additional finding of left ventricular thrombus， pos-sibly a complication of NSTEMI， which was treated with anticoagulation to complete resolution.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】SCAD is fatal， it can proceed to cause myocardial infarction as in this particular patient's case， and sudden death if not recognized early. It can be missed on angiography alone； further intracoronary imaging such as in-travascular ultrasound and optical computed tomography should be used to confirm the diagnosis of SCAD so that early and appropriate treatment can ensue.\n\n【6】MeSH Keywords： Coronary Artery Disease· Dissection· Myocardial Infarction\n\n【7】Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an infre quent cause of acute myocardial infarction. Earlier， diagno-sis of SCAD was mostly established on postmortem exam-ination . Coronary dissection has been repoited to be associated with several factors， including pregnancy ， hyper-tension ， cocaine use ， connective tissue and vasculitic dis-order ， coronary spasm ， blunt chest trauma， and physi-cal exercise . Newer techniques have been able to establish diagnosis of SCAD more accurately in young populations like optical computed tomography and intravascular ultrasound.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】We present a case of a 34-year-old African American male with a history of sickle cell disease who presented to our emergency department with complaints of left sided chest pain radiating towards shoulder associated with shortness of breath. The patient was admitted by Cardiology Service as his troponin was positive in the emergency department. The pa-tient was administered morphine， nitrog ycerin， and started on intravenous heparin to be treated as non-ST elevation myo-cardial infarction (NSTEMI). Hospitalist service was consulted as the patient was suspected to also have concurrent sickle cell crisis. The patient's chest x-ray was without any signs of infiltrates， the ECG showed T-wave inversion in v4-v6 leads and right bundle branch block， troponins were trended which peaked at 2.7 ng/mL\n\n【10】An echocardiogram was ordered but the patient was taken to the catherization laboratory before results were interpreted. During the catheterization， the patient had radiolucency in the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery which was identified by the angiographer and looked suspicious for SCAD. Intravascular ultrasound was performed which dem-onstrated the false lumen and intramural hemorrhage and pos-sible thrombus/plaque formation within it . As the patient had NSTEMI， percutaneous coronary revascularization was performed， and 3 drug-eluting stents placed in the vessel to cover the entire length of lesion .\n\n【11】Furthermore， the patient's echocardiogram showed a left ven-tricular thrombus ， therefore intravenous heparin was resumed after percutaneous coronary revascularization and bridged to coumadin. During the succeeding days， repeat echocardiogram showed clearance of left ventricular thrombus. Hypercoagulable workup was performed but negative. It was believed that the patient developed left ventricular thrombus possibly from NSTEMI. The patient was discharged in stable condition on coumadin and dual antiplatelets (aspirin and Plavix) with no recurrent chest pain.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】SCAD is a rare condition described initially in 1931. Patients who have SCAD present with acute myocardial infarction or sudden death .SCAD is reported in the literature to occur more frequently in females， age range 25 to 60 years， and re-lated to pregnancy， the postpartum period ， and oral con-traceptive pills . Our patient was a young male without any common risk factors to develop SCAD.\n\n【14】SCAD is an infrequent etiology of acute myocardial infarction with an incidence of 0.1% to 1.1% of all acute coronary syn-dromes . Normally the pathophysiology of acute myocar-dial infarction involves a plaque acutely rupturing and forming a superimposed thrombus which leads to acute myocardialinfarction ， however， in SCAD it can mimic the appearance of atherosclerotic lesion in a non-atherosclerotic coronary artery.\n\n【15】Saw  characterized SCAD angiographically into 3 types： type I presents as multiple radiolucent lumens during angiographic contrast staining with dye； type ll is defined as a change in ar-terial caliber with demarcation from normal diameter to dif-fuse narrowing； and type Ill mimics atherosclerosis.\n\n【16】There are 2 proposed mechanisms of SCAD. First， an intimal tear leads to hemorrhage in the inner layer of media， therefore cre-ating a false lumen. This mechanism relates to the radiolucentlumen identified angiographically. Second， it is proposed that there may be rupture of vaso vasorum that may cause intra-mural hemorrhage . This can be related angiographically by identifying luminal compression .\n\n【17】Our patient case did present with an acute myocardial infarc-tion， the patient had angiographic findings of radiolucent lumen leading to a suspicion of SCAD by the angiographer， therefore， an intravascular ultrasound was performed in order to con-firm the diagnosis of SCAD. Intravascular ultrasound did con-firm a false lumen with hemorrhage and organized thrombus. Optical computed tomography was not performed due to lack of availability at our institution. Although optical computed tomography does provide better visualization of dissection， it may propagate dissection in some cases due to forceful con-trast injection and should be used with caution.\n\n【18】The incidence of catheter-induced coronary dissection was approximately 30% in the pre-stent area but decrease to 2%to 3% with availability of stents. The independent predictors for chronic ischemic cardiovascular disease (CICD) are female sex and percutaneous coronary revascularization in patients with a complex anatomy (chronic total occlusion， bifurcation， and left main trunk lesion). Reports have suggested that there is instability of plaque and endothelial cell dysfunction in fe-males associated with changes in estrogen and progesterone levels which in turn increases the stress of vessel walls and risk of dissection . Vigorous injection of contrast， selec-tion of larger catheters，inappropriate positioning of catheters， especially in patients with ostial lesions and subintimal pas-sage of guidewire， are also associated with risk of CICD . In our case， the patient presented with NSTEMI， was hemo-dynamically stable， had left main disease but no ostial lesion identified， and had a fixed defect on angiography and intra-vascular ultrasound without any distal propagation even with repeated contrast injections， therefore our patient had SCAD rather than CICD.\n\n【19】SCAD is usually an underestimated diagnosis due to variable angiographic findings and dependent on skills of angiographer， therefore any suspicious finding on angiograph should be con-firmed with additional imaging such as optical computed to-mography and intravascular ultrasound.Optical computed to-mography is better at identifying intimal tears， thrombi and intramural hemorrhage， however， intravascular ultrasound can identify false lumen， compression of true lumen， and intra-mural hemorrhage but is not very helpful in identifying inti-mal tears . Some evidence suggests that SCAD can oc-cur without intimal tears as reported by Maehara et al.  and Arnold et al. ， which described 5 cases and 4 cases respectively that had SCAD， but intimal tear was not visual-ized connecting the true and false lumens. Optical computed tomography had a much lower resolution (15 um) and wasconsidered ideal for identifying intimal tears， should an inter-vention be planned in order to seal the tear .\n\n【20】Management of SCAD is controversial. The final treatment does depend on patient's clinical condition， single vessel versus mul-tivessel dissection and presence of ischemia . Conservative therapy has been reported to have good outcomes . It is described that a percutaneous coronary revascularization be performed if the patient is having symptoms of ischemia， if not， patient can be managed conservatively. In our case， the pa-tient received 3 drug-eluting stents to cover the whole section of vessel involved with dissection. It is not clear the advantage of drug-eluting stents has over bare metal stent in SCAD， but it does have a lower risk of stent restenosis.Percutaneous coro-nary revascularization with drug-eluting stents does carry its own complication： 1) expansion of hemorrhage and hematoma requiring stenting of large lengths of artery， and 2) guidewire insertion into false lumen propagating the dissection .\n\n【21】SCAD is a rare entity and can present in young people with car-diac symptoms. It does take a high index of suspicion and at-tention to the angiographic findings of SCAD in order to con-firm it with additional intracoronary imaging (optical computed tomography and intravascular ultrasound). SCAD is a fatal dis-ease and earlier detection can help successfully manage it. Our patient did not have the common risk factors associated with SCAD， therefore clinicians should also be judicious of SCAD in patients without prominent risk factors as well.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Autoimmune pancreatitis can present with extrahepatic stric-tures which can be difficult to distinguish from malignant strictures， including cholangiocarcino-ma. Elevated serum IgG4 levels are a feature of autoimmune pancreatitis and histologically the disease is characterised by a significant periductal lymphoplasmacytic in filtration rich in IgG4 pos-itive cells.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】The following two cases represent the different treatment options available to patients presenting with malignant bile duct strictures thought to be cholangiocarcinoma which eventually proved to be due to autoimmune pancreatitis. Patient 1 is a 62 year old gentleman of South American de-scent， and patient 2 is a 72 year old Caucasian gentleman.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】Pre-operative diagnosis in autoimmune-related bile duct strictures is important as it may negate the need for major complex surgery.\n\n【6】key words： autoimmune pancreatitis · cholangiocarcinoma\n\n【7】Abbreviations： AlP -autoimmune pancreatitis\n\n【8】BACKGROUND\n\n【9】Autoimmune aetiology remains a rare cause of pancreatitis which can present with bile duct strictures. It is important to differentiate between strictures arising due to autoimmune aetiologies from those due to malignancy when planning treatment as a preoperative diagnosis of a benign stricture may negate the need for complex surgery. This case report describes the diagnosis and treatment of two patients with autoimmune distal common bile duct (CBD) strictures pre-senting as cholangiocarcinoma. Accurate preoperative di-agnosis is extremely important in directing treatment and preventing patients with benign lesions from undergoing major surgery with its associated morbidity.\n\n【10】CASE REPORT\n\n【11】Case presentation one\n\n【12】A 62-vear-old gentleman of South American descent pre-sented in December 2008 with nausea， weight loss and painless obstructive jaundice， with no relevant past medi-cal history. Clinical examination revealed he was jaundiced but was otherwise unremarkable. CT scan of the abdo-men showed marked intra- and extra- hepatic duct dilata-tion and a tight stricture of the distal CBD，but no obvious pancreatic duct dilatation . No other organs ap peared affected. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancrea-tography (MRCP) confirmed the findings and endoscop ic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) showed a stricture in the distal CBD . At ERCP， a stent was inserted across the stricture and brushings were tak-en which failed to show any evidence of malignancy. The patient's liver function tests returned to normal follow-ing stent insertion. The stricture was thought to represent a distal cholangiocarcinoma and a recommendation was made for the patient to be put forward for a staging lap-aroscopy followed by a Whipple’s type procedure. His se-rum CA19-9 was normal.\n\n【13】Staging laparoscopy showed no evidence of peritoneal de-posits， ascites， liver metastasis or nodal disease. The patient was explored with the intention of performing a pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD) however at surgery the entire pancreas was macroscopically abnormal with induration present within the head of the pancreas extending across the mesenterico-portal axis into the body and proximal tail. Trans-duodenal core biopsies of the mass were sent for frozen section analysis， which showed chronic pancreatitis with no dysplasia or malignancy. A cholecystec-tomy was performed and a hepatico-jejunostomy fashioned high up onto the biliary confluence. Post-operatively the pa-tient made an uneventful recovery.\n\n【14】Postoperative serum IgG4 levels were requested to exclude ef1l autoimmune pancreatitis and were found to be significant-ly elevated at 3.45 g/L (normal range 0-1.3g/l). The pan-creatic tissue (core biopsies) showed variable fibrosis and chronic lymphocytic inflammation with no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy. Immunohistochemistry showed the presence of mildly increased numbers of IgG4 positive plasma cells ， confirming the diagnosis of auto-immune pancreatitis. The patient was given a short course of steroids (5 mg prednisolone daily for four weeks). Hehas been followed up in the clinic regularly up to the cur-rent time (18 months) and remains well.\n\n【15】Case presentation two\n\n【16】A 72-year-old Caucasian gentleman was found to have ab-normal liver function tests as part of routine health screen-ing.Abdominal examination was unremarkable. CT abdo-men showed a bulky pancreas ， a mildly dilated extrahepatic biliary system and raised the possibil-ity of an ampullary tumour. ERCP confirmed a l cm dis-tal CBD stricture with a dilated proximal CBD and dilat-ed pancreatic duct . The proximal pancreatic duct appeared normal. Ampullary biopsies and biliary cy-tology were negative. The serum CA19-9 was 44. No other organs appeared affected. Past medical history included previous partial gastrectomy 20 years previously for pep-tic ulcer disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-ease. A presumed diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma was made and he was referred to our unit for consideration of radical surgery.\n\n【17】A PET scan was normal and MRCP showed a slightly dilat-ed biliary tract and a dilated pancreatic duct suggesting an underlying ampullary lesion. A repeat ERCP revealed res-olution of the stricture in the CBD and the possibility of an inflammatory aetiology was raised. IgG-4 levels were mea-sured at this point to be raised at 2.90 g/L， suggesting au-toimmune pancreatitis. Due to the patient’s poor physical health， it was decided a conservative course of action was appropriate. The patient’s liver function tests subsequently stabilized over the next 12 months， and he was followed up regularly in clinic over this time. He was then discharged from regular follow up.\n\n【18】DISCUSSION\n\n【19】Cholangiocarcinoma is the second commonest primary hep-atobiliary malignancy， and accounts for 2-3% of all gastro-intestinal cancers. The prognosis is poor as 90% of these tumours are unresectable at presentation ， and recur-rence rates after incomplete surgical resection are high Diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma can be extremely difficult as the condition may be mimicked by a variety of malignant and non-malignant disease processes， and the diagnosis is often made at operation or on histopathology.\n\n【20】Autoimmune pancreatitis is a unique form of chronic pan-creatitis which has complications involving the pancreas and various extra-pancreatic organs . The most commonlyaffected organs are extra- and intra-hepatic bile ducts， kid-neys， retroperitoneum and salivary glands， the most com-mon of these being the biliary tree . When affecting the biliary tract， it may mimic cholangiocarcinoma， or it may cause benign mass lesions of the pancreas which can resem-ble adenocarcinoma . The disease predominantly affects elderly men with the commonest presenting symptom be-ing obstructive jaundice.\n\n【21】Autoimmune pancreatitis has been shown to have certain typical radiological changes， for example diffuse parenchy-mal swelling with minimal peri-pancreatic inflammation on CT，and duct strictures on ERCP.Some of these features were seen in our patients and they should raise clinical sus-picion of AIP. Serum IgG4 is a sensitive and specific marker for diagnosing autoimmune pancreatitis . In differenti-ating between pancreatic cancer and autoimmune pancre-atitis， IgG4 has been reported to have a sensitivity of 90%， a specificity of 98%， with overall accuracy of 95%. Raised IgG4 should not be considered diagnostic of autoimmune pancreatitis however， as 7-10% of patients with pancreatic cancer and approximately 10% of patients with cholangio-carcinoma will also have increased levels， however IgG4 1ev-els greater than twice the upper limit of normal are specificfor autoimmune pancreatitis， and an isolated rise in IgG4level is can be characteristic of AIP. The exact role of Ig G4 in the pathogenesis of the disease is not fully understood .\n\n【22】The co-existence of AIP is the most important finding in dis-tinguishing between IgG4-SC and other conditions such as primary sclerosing cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma. In our patients， some features suggestive of the link were present， such as the increased IgG4 levels in both patients， and the effect of the steroid therapy in patient 2. Few re-ports of autoimmune pancreatitis with IgG4-associated scle-rosing cholangitis (IgG4-SC) mimicking cholangiocarcino-ma have been published . Hamano et al highlight the possible val-ue of IgG4 staining in biopsy specimens of the bile duct in distinguishing between autoimmune disease and malignan-cy . Brushings were attempted of the common bile duct in both patients at the time of ERCP and were negative for malignancy in both cases. Another modality of distinguish-ing between benign and malignant disease processes could be very important in these patients. The histology in auto-immune pancreatitis is typically characterised by a signif-icant periductal lymphoplasmacytic infiltration . This infiltration is rich in IgG4 positive cells and this feature is shown in Patient 1 in our series. Several new modalities are emerging to aid differentiation between IgG4-SC and chol-angiocarcinoma， for example intraductal ultrasonography(IDUS) and transpapillary biopsy .\n\n【23】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【24】Autoimmune pancreatitis responds extremely well to treat-ment with steroids， often in a relatively short period of time， and if there is uncertainty over diagnosis， a short course of steroids may be used to try to exclude an autoimmune cause for bile duct strictures when considering this diag-nosis . Pre-operative diagnosis in autoimmune-related bile duct strictures is important as it may negate the need for ma-jor complex surgery and its associated morbidity and mor-tality. One year later， both patients remain well and underobservation.Neither patient required long term treatment with steroids. These case reports demonstrate the need for accurate pre-operative diagnosis， and the importance that clinicians should consider alternative diagnoses in patients with bile duct strictures without confirmed malignancy.\n\n【25】Consent\n\n【26】Written informed consent was obtained from the patients for publication of this case report and accompanying im-ages.

Pharmaco-invasive reperfusion approach was adopted with full dose tis-sue plasminogen activator， followed by transferring the patient to a specialized heart center for Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCl). Coronary angiography showed a fresh thrombus totally occluding Left Anterior Descending (LAD) and another thrombus causing distal total occlusion of a dominant Right Coronary Artery(RCA). Two Bare metal stents were placed in both lesions with Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 3flow post dilatation， but the patient， unfortunately， went into Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) followed by asystole and died 35 minutes later.\n\n【2】Conclusions： Acute double vessel coronary artery thrombosis is a serious event that requires prompt diagnosis and man-agement to prevent its complications.\n\n【3】Key words： multiple plaques rupture · double coronary thrombosis · Coronary occlusionAcute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI) usual-ly presents by an occluding thrombus in 1 artery that is the“culprit”lesion， but on rare occasions this culprit lesion can be found in more than 1 artery. This is extremely rare， and is es-timated to occur in 2.5% of all primary PCl patients .Most of these patients have evidence of hemodynamic instability， with 28% being in cardiogenic shock，22% having life-threat-ening ventricular arrhythmias， and 22% requiring intra-aortic balloon pumps . One of the postulated reasons for such low incidence is that most of the patients die from sudden cardiac death (SCD) before coming to the hospital， and the incidence is much higher in autopsies of sudden cardiac death patients， reaching up to 50% of cases . Although the cause of simul-taneous acute thrombosis of multiple coronary arteries is still unclear， many theories are postulated， including the presence of a hyper coagulable state or increased catecholamine surge and inflammatory response caused by the occlusion of the first artery causing thrombosis of the other . In this study we present a rare case of double coronary thrombosis myo-cardial infarction and discuss our management of the case， the possible causes of double infarction， and the outcomes of this high-risk presentation.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】Our patient was a 47-year-old man of Indian origin， who was diabetic， a heavy smoker， and without family or previous histo-ry of coronary artery disease (CAD). He reached the emergency2 hours after feeling a severe crushing retro-sternal chest pain associated with diaphoresis. At the emergency department， the patient was hemodynamically stable， with blood pressure of139/103 mmHg，equal in both arms， pulse of 125 beats per minute (bpm) and Sp02 of 98% on room air. His chest was clear to auscultation and heart examination results were nor-mal.Electrocardiograph ECG showed extensive antero-lateral ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction . Because the anticipated time from first medical contact to PCI (percu-taneous coronary intervention) was >120 min， a pharmaco-in-vasive strategy was adopted， and the patient received aspirin300 mg， clopidogrel 300 mg， and heparin 4000 units IV bolus stat， followed by continuous Ⅳ infusion of heparin by 1000unit/hour. Tissue plasminogen activator (TPA)， reteplase ad-ministered I stat in 2 doses (10 units each)， separated by a30 min interval according to the protocol. High sensitive tro-ponin T results were positive (105 ng/L and normal level 3-14ng/L). No thrombocytosis was found. Just prior to the trans-fer of the patient to the specialized heart center， his general condition began to deteriorate， requiring elective intubation for impending respiratory failure. The patient was transport-ed from the emergency department to a PCI-capable facility in60 min. The patient's coronary angiography showed total oc-clusion by a fresh thrombus to both proximal LAD  and distal RCA . The LAD lesion was crossed using a guide wire， with achievement of TIMI 3 flow immediately after passing it . This was followed by deployment of a bare metal stent (BMS)， with good angiographic results. Attention was shifted then to RCA， and the distal lesion was crossed using another guide wire and TIMI 3 flow was established . This was followed by balloon dil-atation， then a BMS was deployed， with TIMI 3 flow post-de-ployment . Unfortunately， immediately after the procedure， the patient developed VF and received 1 direct cur-rent shock， followed by cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)， which lasted for 35 minutes， but the patient died.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Acute myocardial infarction caused by simultaneous multi-ves-sel coronary occlusion is a rarely reported event that needs immediate management owing to the high rate of complica-tions such as arrhythmia， heart failure， and cardiogenic shock. Incidence of double-vessel coronary thrombosis may account for 1.7% to 4.8% of all primary PCIs  and it is believed that this incidence is far below the actual value. The incidence of occlusion in more than 1 epicardial artery reached up to 50%of an autopsy series of patients who died from SCD . Thus， such low incidence reflects a selection bias because most of the patients die before reaching the hospital. The study by Pollak et al. ， despite its limitations， has provided some in-formation about the critical nature of this pathology， reportingthat nearly one-third of patients are presented in cardiogen-ic shock， and nearly one-forth required intra-aortic balloon pump or have a life-threatening arrhythmia. It appears that multivessel coronary thrombosis trends to be more common in heavily smoking males with dyslipidemia ， such as this patient. Pollak et al.  found that the percentage of males was 85% and history of current tobacco use reached 49%；the percentage of diabetics was 21%； history of previous CAD， MI or PCl， was 15% (indicating that most patients had first-diag-nosis ST elevation Ml)； and the mean age was 54 (±14). Mostof these characteristics were found in our patient. Pollak et al also reported that the most common ECG finding is inferi-or ST elevation (30%)， followed by inferior and anterior ST el-evation (19%)， then anterior and lateral ST elevation (15%)， as in our patient . Angiographically， RCA and LAD acute oc-clusion (49%) was the commonest presentation (as in our pa-tient)， followed by RCA and left circumflex (28%). There were several factors we had to consider regarding the management of our patient. The first was which strategy we should use for reperfusion. We had 3 options： to start thrombolysis by tissueplasminogen activator (tPA) alone， to transfer the patient to a specialized heart center for primary PCl， or to give tPA then transfer for PCI as soon as possible (the“pharmaco-invasive”approach). The patient was had been experiencing chest pain for only 2 hours and his ECG result and clinical picture were suggestive of extensive anterior Ml with left ventricular fail-ure. We also anticipated that the time from first medical con-tact (FMC) to PCI would take >120 minutes. Thus， we start-ed thrombolysis， as recommended by the current European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and American Heart Association(AHA) guidelines (class IA) ， followed by the transfer of the patient to the catheterization laboratory as soon as possi-ble to do PCI (Pharmaco-invasive reperfusion). This approach was shown to reduce mortality and morbidity 30 days post-MI. The second consideration was whether we should place an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) before starting the PCI. It was obvious that the patient had an extensive myocardial in-farction with total double-vessel acute occlusion， and we saw that advantage of starting the intervention to achieve a swift reperfusion to the ischemic myocardium， which outweighed the benefit of placing a pump that would require a new arte-rial access and would further delay the PCI. This was support-ed by the evidence of several studies that showed the benefit of PCI diminishes with time， with increased 30-day mortali-ty . On the other hand， the benefit of IABP is a matter of debate， with many trials showing contradictory evidence and even no mortality benefit . Thus， our decision was to begin with the PCI followed by insertion of an IABP soon after the procedure. Unfortunately， the patient went into VF followed by asystole and died before pump placement.\n\n【8】The etiology of multivessel coronary thrombosis is still not ful-ly understood. Many of case reports published in the litera-ture have obvious predisposing factors such as coronary ar-tery vasospasm ， idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura， antithrombin III deficiency and thrombophilia . Other cases were reported following cocaine abuse  and during puerperium . In a few other cases， the cause was unclear . We believe that the pathogenesis of multiple coronary occlusive lesions may be explained by the simulta-neous rupture of multiple plaques during the progression of myocardial infarction. Rioufol et al. reported that 19 acute coronary syndrome patients out of 50 had ruptured plaques in more than 1 epicardial coronary artery， diagnosed by intra vascular ultrasound (IUS). However， other studies illustrated that plaque rupture can also be found in chronic stable angi-na patients or even asymptomatic patients ， and the clinical picture depends on other variables such as thrombus formation and lumen size . In consideration of the above factors， it appears that a high thrombus burden and/or a small lumen area are necessary to have multiple occlusive lesions causing ST-elevation myocardial infarction and simultaneous-ly ruptured plaques.\n\n【9】Conclusions\n\n【10】Acute double-vessel coronary artery thrombosis is a serious event that requires prompt diagnosis and management to pre-vent complications.

It is also known as progressive hepatolenticular degeneration. There are four main clinical forms of WD： hepatic， neurological， psychia-tric， and presymptomatic (presymptomatic patients are usually diagnosed by family screening). Patients with Wilson’s or other severe liver diseases constitute appreciable risk when undergoing anesthesia and surgery .\n\n【8】Historically， the use of regional anesthetic techniques within this patient population has been relatively con-traindicated for fear of worsening neurologic outcome. Several theoretical factors contribute to this belief， including an increased risk of neurologic injury from needle-or catheter-induced mechanical trauma， local anesthetic toxicity， neural ischemia secondary to local anesthetic additives， personal biases from the patient， and potential medicolegal implications .\n\n【9】We report a spinal anesthesia in a neurologically impaired patient with Wilson’s disease undergoing intramedullary nailing of a femoral fracture.\n\n【10】CASE REPORT\n\n【11】A 18 year old male patient was administered for proximal femur fracture repair.

The preoperative care was coordinated with the departments of orthopedic surgery， neurology， and internal medicine and regional anesthesia was chosen as the anesthetic method.\n\n【12】The patient was taken to the operation room to un-dergo intramedullary nailing and following standart anesthetic monitoring and initiation of crystalloid infusion， a 25-gauge Quincke needle was insertedthrough L3-4 intervertebral space with the patient in left lateral decubitis position. Spinal anesthesia was achieved by 3 mL hyperbaric bupivacaine. The patient was then immediately turned supine. The surgical operation was uneventful and the patient remained haemodynamically stable throughout the procedure. He was then transferred to orthopedics ward.\n\n【13】Approximately 2 h after surgery his motor and sensory functioning returned to pre-anesthetic level and did not report any new neurologic symptoms. His post-operative laboratory examination was unremarkable. The patient was discharged from the hospital on the fourth postoperative day to maintain his normal therapy at home.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n\n【15】WD is a rare metabolic disorder occurring in 1in 30，000 to 40，000 of the general population . Accumulation of copper in the liver causes progres-sive hepatic dysfunction and portal hypertension whereas accumulation of copper in brain results in neuronal injury and produces motor， intellectual， and behavioral dysfunction . Patients with WD require life-long treatment with de-coppering agents， such as penicillamine， trientine， tetrahydromolibdate and zinc， regular follow-up with repeated laboratory tests to monitor the disease， therapy and side effects of medicationPatients with cirrhosis undergoing anaesthesia and surgery have increased morbidity and mortality. It has been reported that the mortality rates in patients with cirrhosis undergoing various surgical procedures range from 8.3% to 25% in comparison to 1.1% in non-cirrhotic patients . The anesthetic manage-ment of patients with significant liver dysfunction and hepatic failure is challenging and fraught with many potential complications . Liver’s reduced ability to metabolize some drugs， increased risk of coagu-lopathy and anemia， jeopardized hepatic circulation， and metabolic disorders are the main problems along with other system dysfunctions. The anesthesiologist should perform a careful preoperative assessment including Child-Pugh classification  and a close perioperative monitoring.\n\n【16】Although different anesthetic techniques have been used in patients with liver diseases， the best anes thetic technique remains elusive . Either general or regional， anesthesia causes a moderate reduction in hepatic arterial blood flow and hepatic oxygen uptake . Moreover， patients with liver disease are more likely than patients without liver disease to ex-perience hepatic decompensation with anesthesia .\n\n【17】Volatile anesthetics such as halothane and enflu-rane reduce hepatic arterial blood flow as a result of systemic vasodilatation and a slightly negative inotropic effect . Furthermore， hypercarbia initia-tes sympathetic stimulation of the splanchnic vascu-lature， thereby decreasing portal blood flow， and should be avoided in patients with liver disease . Regional anesthesia have been reported beneficial in patients with advanced liver disease if coagulopathy not exists.\n\n【18】There are not much reports regarding anesthetic management in patients with WD in literature ， and only two cases of successful epidural anesthesia has been reported . Another consideration in WD is the potential risks with regional anesthesia in patients with neurologic deficits . The use of regional anesthetic techniques within this patient population has been relatively contraindicated his-torically for fear of worsening neurologic outcome. The theoretical risk of needle- or catheter-induced mechanical trauma， local anethetic toxicity， or neural ischemia， combined with chronic， underlying neural compromise， was thought to place these patients at increased risk of further neurologic injury . For example， Wiertlewski et al  reported a Guillain-\n\n【19】Barre syndrome case， with worsening of neurologic symptoms after delivery during epidural anesthesia. However， the etiology of postoperative neurologic deficits is often difficult to evaluate because of the many patient， surgical， and anesthetic risk factors that may play a role . In a recent review by Hebl et al where patients with a history of central nervous system disorder and subsequently received neuraxial anesthesia or analgesia， none of the 139 patients ex-perienced new or worsening neurologic deficits. The authors stated that the risks commonly associated with neuraxial anesthesia and analgesia in patients with preexisting CNS disorders may not be as frequent as once thought and that neuraxial blockade should not be considered an absolute contraindication within this patient population . Considering this informa-tion spinal anesthesia was decided as the anesthetic method in our case.\n\n【20】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【21】We report a case of successful spinal anesthesia in a patient with WD. We think that spinal anesthesia may be an effective and safe technique and it may represent a valid alternative to other anesthetic approaches for patients with cerebral manifestations of WD.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Several pro-amyloid proteins can produce amyloid deposits in the heart. Each of these amyloidoses has characteristic clinical (cardiac and extracardiac) features， and a specific diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 58-year-old woman who presented with acute heart failure and echocardiographic findings strongly sug-gestive of infiltrative cardiomyopathy needed percutaneous veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygen-ation (ECMO) as bridge-to-decision. Amyloid deposition was found on endomyocardial and bone marrow biop-sies. Bone marrow plasma cell infiltrate with acute renal lesion and hypercalcemia confirmed the diagnosis of multiple myeloma-associated systemic light-chain amyloidosis (AL). Refractory shock with multi-organic fail-ure syndrome persisted and no improvements in left ventricular function and structure were seen. After ex-tensive discussion by a multidisciplinary team， and with the patients’ family， she was not considered eligible for high-dose chemotherapy and/or autologous stem cell transplantation， heart transplantation， or sequential heart with autologous stem cell transplantation. The patient died a few hours after ECMO withdrawal. During the 14 days of ECMO support no major bleeding or thrombotic complications occurred.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】The clinician must consider a diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis in patients with heart failure， a restrictive type of cardiomyopathy with ventricular hypertrophy in the absence of valve abnormalities， or uncontrolled arteri-al hypertension. Although developments in chemotherapy have greatly improved the outcomes in AL amyloi-dosis， the prognosis of patients with severe cardiac involvement remains very poor. ECMO is potentially a reli-able bridge-to-diagnosis and bridge-to-decision in these patients. An experienced ECMO team， careful patient selection， and rigorous management protocols with objective criteria to wean or stop ECMO are needed.\n\n【6】MeSH Keywords： Amyloidosis · Cardiomyopathy， Restrictive·Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation· Heart Failure·Shock， CardiogenicIn the setting of acute heart failure (HF) of unknown etiology where the patient has refractory shock， veno-arterial ECMO can serve as a bridge-to-diagnosis and potentially as destina-tion therapy. In such patients the most import objective is to exclude potentially reversible causes of HF such as acute myo-carditis， Takotsubo syndrome， acute coronary syndrome， or drug intoxication and consider heart transplantation . Use of ECMO can buy valuable time in this clinical setting . However， there are no rigorous management protocols with objective criteria to initiate and wean or stop ECMO.\n\n【7】We report a case of multiple myeloma-associated light-chain amyloidosis with severe cardiac involvement presenting with acute and rapidly deteriorating heart failure where full evalua-tion was not possible and in whom death would occur without ECMO support. The cardiac amyloidosis diagnostic workup and the AL amyloidosis-specific treatment options are highlighted. We also discuss the venoarterial (VA) ECMO indications， the appropriate patient selection， and the concept of ECMO futility.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 58-year-old woman was admitted to the Emergency Department complaining of dyspnea and peripheral edema. She reported a6-month history of symmetric lower-limb edema， dyspnea on exertion， orthopnea， and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.\n\n【10】Her medical history was unremarkable except for arterial hy-pertension and schizophrenia. Medication included ramipril and sulpiride. There were no known drug allergies. The pa-tient was a single housewife without children. She did not smoke and rarely drank alcohol. There was no family history of cardiac disease.\n\n【11】On physical examination the patient was not in distress. Axillary temperature was 36.3℃， blood pressure 90/65 mmHg， and pulse 101 beats per minute， the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute， and oxygen saturation 94% while breathing room air. The sclerae were anicteric， mucous membranes were moist， and the oropharynx was clear. The neck was supple， with no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly. Carotid pulses were nor-mal， without bruits. Jugular turgescence was markedly visible at 45° neck elevation. There was dullness on percussion over the right lung base， with no breath sounds； the lungs were otherwise clear on auscultation. The apex beat was not palpa-ble， and there was no right ventricular heave. Cardiac auscul-tation was normal. The abdomen was distended but not ten-der， with a fluid wave. The liver was enlarged， and the spleen was not palpable. Pitting edema involved the legs， perineum， and abdominal wall， and there was mild bilateral upper-limbedema. Distal pulses were palpable. Changes associated with chronic venous stasis were present in the lower extremities. Neurologic examination was unremarkable.\n\n【12】Blood analysis revealed mildly raised creatinine and urea， de creased albumin with raised ionized calcium (6.7 mg/dL； nor-mal range 4.6-5.4)； NT-pro-BNP was markedly high (17719pg/mL， normal <100 pg/mL) and troponin I was 0.07 ng/dL(normal<0.01ng/dL)； transferrin saturation was low (9.9%). Urinalysis showed non-nephrotic proteinuria. Laboratory re-sults are presented in Table 1.\n\n【13】The anteroposterior chest x-ray depicted a severely enlarged cardiac silhouette，ingurgitated hilar and interstitial pulmonary vasculature， and right pleural effusion .\n\n【14】The admission electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with first-degree AV block (PR 280 ms)， low QRS voltage(<5 mm)， leftward axis deviation， poor R-wave progression，and diffuse nonspecific T-wave changes . During electrical monitoring， periods of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were noted.\n\n【15】Transthoracic echocardiography  showed： a) left and right ventricular hypertrophy (interventricular septum of17 mm and right ventricular free wall of 7 mm)； b) severe bi-atrial enlargement (left atrium of 52 mL/m²and right atrium of 48 mL/m?) with normal ventricular chambers； c) severely depressed left and right ventricular systolic function (left ven-tricular ejection fraction \\[LVEF\\] of 16%， mean tissue Doppler mitral S'velocity： 4 cm/s； tricuspid annular plane systolic excur-sion \\[TAPSE\\]： 8 mm and tricuspid S'velocity by tissue Doppler：6 cm/s)； d) elevated left ventricular filling pressures (mean E/e'ratio of 19)； d) absence of significant valvular disease or sig-nificant respiratory variation in mitral E velocity； e) and nor-mal pericardium with minimum pericardial effusion. On the left atrial appendage， a highly mobile thrombus was visible.\n\n【16】At this point the clinical and echocardiographic data strongly in-dicated restrictive cardiomyopathy due to an infiltrative process； amyloidosis is the most common cause of this condition .\n\n【17】On the 2nd day of hospitalization， the patient had a cardiac ar-rest with ventricular fibrillation. Return of spontaneous circu-lation was achieved after 10 minutes of advanced life support. She recovered without neurological deficits but hemodynam-ic instability persisted. Inotropic and vasopressor support with dobutamine and norepinephrine was required. Current guide-lines based on expert opinion recommend dopamine or dobu-tamine as first-line agents， with moderate hypotension (systol-ic blood pressure 70 to 100 mm Hg) and norepinephrine as the preferred therapy for severe hypotension (systolic blood pressure<70 mm Hg) . We preferred small combined doses of inotro-pes and vasopressors over a single agent used at higher doses\n\n【18】Table 1.

Despite optimal medical treatment， deterioration of respiratory， renal， and hepatic func-tion occurred  and mechanical ventilation and peripher-al veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were started. Cannulation of the right femoral vein and artery using 23 and 17 French catheters， respectively， was performed and the ECMO (Quadrox PLS oxygenator and Rotaflow RF 32， Maquet Cardiopulmonar AG， Maquet Gmbh & Co.，Germany) was set at a flow rate of 5 L/min (3000 rotation per minute).\n\n【22】The confirmation of the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis re-quires the demonstration of amyloid deposits on tissue biop-sy. Since typical echocardiographic signs were present，amy-loid deposition could be demonstrated first in other tissues that are more accessible than cardiac tissue； therefore， en-domyocardial biopsy was not performed at this initial stage.\n\n【23】On the 4th day of hospitalization， abdominal fat tissue aspi-rate was performed. No amyloid deposition was demonstrat-ed (negative for Congo red staining). A renal biopsy was the next step but no amyloid deposits were found. Thus， we de-cided to perform the endomyocardial biopsy.\n\n【24】Cardiac catheterization was performed； coronary angiography excluded obstructive coronary artery disease and 4 fragments of the interventricular septum obtained. The histological exam-ination showed no signs suggesting myocarditis， granulomas， or iron deposition  and confirmed amyloid deposits- positive staining with both Congo red in the few small ves-sels walls represented in the myocardial specimen . It was not possible to determine the subtype of the amyloid material (Immunoglobulin AL， Amyloid A， or transthyretin) by immunohistochemistry. In these cases， AL amyloidosis must be ruled out. To do this， serum protein electrophoresis and se-rum and urine immunofixation were performed.\n\n【25】Two bands with monoclonal characteristics matching Kappa light-chains were detected on both serum and urine immuno-fixation . Bone marrow aspirate  and biop-sy showed abundant amyloid deposits  and plasma cells infiltrate (16%) with Kappa light-chain antibody restriction. These findings in combination with the acute renal lesion at presentation and hypercalcemia confirmed the diagnosis of multiple myeloma-related systemic AL amyloidosis.\n\n【26】Refractory shock with multi-organic failure syndrome persisted and no improvements in left ventricular function and structure were seen. After extensive discussion， the patient was not con-sidered eligible for high-dose chemotherapy and/or autologous stem cell transplantation， heart transplantation， or sequential heart with autologous stem cell transplantation， and contin-uation of ECMO was considered futile. After discussion with the patient's family， ECMO support was stopped and the pa-tient died a few hours later. During the 14 days of ECMO sup-port， no major bleeding or thrombotic complications occurred.\n\n【27】Discussion\n\n【28】In our case， the main differential diagnosis at presentation was restrictive cardiomyopathy due to an infiltrative process. Both the left and right ventricular were thickened and there was no secondary cause for this hypertrophy (e.g.， uncontrolledhypertension， aortic stenosis， pulmonary hypertension) . Constrictive pericarditis could explain the biventricular heart failure with a restrictive pathophysiology， but this diagno-sis would not explain the ventricular thickening and reduced septal e' velocities . Myocardial infiltration can occur from different pathophysiological mechanisms， but amyloid pro-tein deposition is the most common process in the Western world . Confirmation of the diagnosis of cardiac amyloi-dosis and the definitive characterization of the type of amy-loidosis is critical for prognostic and treatment purposes， but it is laborious and time-consuming work that evolves a mul-tidisciplinary team.\n\n【29】We decided to initiate mechanical circulatory support (MCS) based on her poor clinical evolution and on medical team's judgment of a potentially reversible condition. There are only a few small series and observational studies available in the literature addressing the issue of MCS management . In our patient， we expected a good neurologic outcome because she had in-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation in less than 20 minutes， and there was no previous neurologic damage， nor was there a history of malignancy or irreversible organ failure. ECMO was chosen over other modal-ities of MCS based on biventricular dysfunction presence， and greater experience of our center with ECMO .\n\n【30】In our case there were typical echocardiographic signs of infil-trative cardiomyopathy， thus amyloid deposition was analyzed first in abdominal fat and renal biopsies. Abdominal fat tissue aspirate sensitivity is high (84-88%) and it is more feasible and safer than endomyocardial biopsy. Some authors have used sal-ivary gland biopsy with excellent results， even in patients with a negative abdominal fat biopsy. Our biopsies of fat and renal tissues were negatives for Congo red staining， but our suspicion for cardiac amyloidosis persisted and a cardiac biopsy was per-formed. Four endomyocardial samples ensure 100% sensitivity for the detection of the disease. Once the presence of amyloid deposition has been confirmed， the next step is the amyloid type identification . Amyloidosis may be acquired or famil-ial and its type is classified according the underlying mecha-nism of pro-amyloid protein synthesis as AL amyloidosis (due to immunoglobulin light-chain)， secondary-reactive (due to se-rum amyloid A)， hereditary-familial (due to transthyretin，apoli-poprotein Al， or apolipoprotein All)， or acquired-senile (due to transthyretin).Cardiac amyloidosis can result from any type of amyloidoses， but when the heart is severally affected， as in the case reported，the differential diagnosis is essentially restrict-ed to transthyretin-associated amyloidosis (senile or late-onset familial amyloidosis) or AL amyloidosis . It has been dem-onstrated that the combination of an abnormal kappa/lamb-da ratio and a positive immunofixation reaction has a sensitiv-ity of 99% for diagnosing AL amyloidosis . In these cases， bone marrow biopsy gives the final answer as to which plas-ma cells disorder (PCD) is producing the paraprotein. According to the 2010 International Myeloma Working Group diagnostic criteria， multiple myeloma is defined by the following 2 crite-ria：  serum monoclonal protein 23 g/dL and/or clonal bone marrow plasma cells 210%， and  presence of end-organ damage such as lytic bone lesions， anemia， hypercalcemia，or renal failure that can be attributed to PCDs . At the time of diagnosis， we found clonal bone marrow plasma cells at 16%， renal failure， and hypercalcemia， which established the defin-itive diagnosis of multiple myeloma.\n\n【31】ECMO support gave us time to confirm the etiology and to plan and discuss treatment and prognosis. In our patient the ther-apeutic alternatives would be high-dose chemotherapy with melphalan and autologous stem cell transplant or a bortezo-mib plus dexamethasone combination . None of these options were considered to be suitable by the multidisciplinary team， taking into account the following reasons： i) bortezo-mib and melphalan have high cardiotoxicity and are associat-ed with worsening fluid retention and congestive heart failure； ii) in patients with severe cardiac involvement (decom-pensated heart failure， an ejection fraction less than 40%， or systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg)， high-dose che-motherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation do not improve survival ；and iii) pharmacological treatment does not remove preexisting amyloid deposits and， therefore， wouldnot significantly improve cardiac function. On the other hand， heart transplantation was contra-indicated due to the possi-bility of other organ system involvement and recurrence of amyloidosis in the graft， since systemic amyloid deposition was already present. Heart transplantation in amyloidosis has been performed almost exclusively in cases with isolated car-diac involvement . In patients with severe cardiac involve ment who are not eligible for chemotherapy and/or autologous stem cell transplantation， some centers recommend sequen-tial heart and autologous stem cell transplantation . If pa-tients do not present outcome-limiting organ dysfunction， ear-ly heart transplant can be performed followed by high-dose chemotherapy with melphalan and autologous stem cell sup-port . However， there is no evidence from randomized controlled trials to support this strategy.\n\n【32】In the clinical vignette， the interruption of ECMO was decid-ed based on the proposals of Lazzeri et al. ， which recom-mends stopping ECMO when： i) there is evidence of brain death(based on serial neurological assessment by means of electro-encephalogram and somato-sensory evocated potentials eval-uation)； ii) in the absence of recovery signs or therapeutic op-tions that could improve the prognosis； and/or iii) the patient is not considered eligible for heart transplant.\n\n【33】Modern medical technology allows support of human life for an indeterminate period. This has led to difficult legal and moral discussions concerning medical futility and transitions from aggressive treatment to palliative care. This article takes a closer look at ethical concerns that intensive care units phy-sicians face while performing weaning or assistance on ECMO. In our case， ECMO was considered medical futility. The pa-tient was terminally weaned off the ECMO， and although we were not euthanizing the patient， we were deciding to remove equipment that will most likely always lead to death. Futility in medicine is an ancient concept. Hippocrates clearly stated that physicians should “refuse to treat those who are over-mastered by their disease， realizing that in such cases medi-cine is powerless\". Medical futility is defined as a clinical action serving no useful purpose in attaining a specified goal for a given patient . In our case，the action-ECMO-ef-fectively delivers blood and oxygen. However， the goals of car-diac function recovery or heart transplantation cannot be ef-fectively achieved with any of the treatment options for which the ECMO was serving as a bridge to. We explained to the pa-tient's family that ECMO would not give her a chance to re-cover. If the goal of aggressive treatment is to prevent bodily death，ECMO would be not futile， as we can achieve this goal. On the other hand， if the intention of aggressive treatment is to return the patient to independent living or prevent immi-nent death， ECMO serve no useful purpose and are futile. ECMO might even be considered maleficent or harmful if the goal of treatment is to allow a more peaceful and dignified death.\n\n【34】The clinician must consider a diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis in patients with heart failure， a restrictive type of cardiomy-opathy with/without ventricular hypertrophy in the absence of valve abnormalities or uncontrolled arterial hypertension. The main types are transthyretin-associated amyloidosis (se-nile or late-onset familial amyloidosis) or AL amyloidosis. Confirmation of amyloid type is now possible in most cases through a combination of immunohistochemistry， DNA anal-ysis， and proteomics. Although developments in chemothera-py have greatly improved the outcomes in AL amyloidosis， the prognosis of patients with severe cardiac involvement remains very poor. ECMO is potentially a reliable bridge-to-diagnosis and bridge-to-decision in these patients. Recent technological developments allow for longer ECMO support， if required. An experienced ECMO team， careful patient selection， and rigorousmanagement protocols with objective criteria to wean or stop ECMO are needed. ECMO futility cannot be determined with-out succinctly stating goals for ECMO support. Negotiating care when either the physician or family believes treatments are futile is a delicate process built upon respecting both pa-tient and professional values. In the end， respect of persons and beneficent approaches can lead to ethically and moral-ly viable solutions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It progresses slowly and may recur after a long time. Therefore， when a tumor is found in the chest of a patient with a history of breast cancer， an immediate con-cern is whether it is a primary tumor or a metastatic tumor. However， mediastinal metastasis is extremely un-likely to occur before lung metastasis， and breast cancer is not likely to have a solitary mediastinal metasta-sis. Additionally， patients should not undergo invasive procedures unnecessarily， so careful consideration is required.\n\n【2】Case Reports：\n\n【3】We present 2 cases. In case 1， a 48-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer had a mediastinal tumor. Based on imaging findings， cystic thymoma was suspected. Thoracoscopic intraoperative rapid biopsy showed a lymphocyte-predominant tumor tissue； therefore， the tumor was resected via a median sternotomy. The final pathological diagnosis was breast cancer metastasis. In case 2， a 47-year-old woman who underwent breast cancer resection 15 years earlier was referred for upper limb edema. Based on imaging findings， a left medi-al vein occlusion due to mediastinal tumor was diagnosed. Our experience in case 1 suggested that a biopsy alone should be performed first. A tumor biopsy was performed through a small transverse neck incision in case 2， and the final diagnosis was metastatic breast cancer of the mediastinum.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】In patients with a suspected primary mediastinal tumor on imaging， the possibility of a metastatic tumor should be considered if they have a history of breast cancer， regardless of how long in the past it was.\n\n【6】MeSH Keywords： Breast Neoplasms· Mediastinal Neoplasms · Thymoma · Thymus NeoplasmsBreast cancer is becoming a common disease in women， and it can affect the clinical course in other systems. When a tu-mor is found in the chest， an immediate concern is whether it is a primary tumor or a metastatic tumor. The patient's histo-ry can be suggestive of the tumor's origin， and if the patient has a history of malignant tumor， it is natural to consider the possibility of metastatic tumor. However， if considerable time has passed since the last treatment for the previous cancer， it is less likely that the lesion will be considered metastatic. We believe that patients should not undergo invasive treatments unnecessarily yet should not lose an opportunity for treatment or a cure. As more patients with a history of breast cancer survive longer， the more difficult the disease will be to treat.\n\n【7】We report a case of a patient with metastatic mediastinal breast cancer for whom medical treatment was difficult and another case in which treatment was informed by experiences in the pre-vious case. Our report presents 2 cases of mediastinal tumor and treatment strategies for patients with a history of breast cancer.\n\n【8】Case Reports\n\n【9】Case 1\n\n【10】A 48-year-old Asian woman received a diagnosis of stage Ⅳcancer of the right breast with lumbar metastasis 3 years pri-or to presentation. A right mastectomy and axillary dissection were performed after preoperative chemotherapy (3 cycles ofepirubicin/cyclophosphamide \\[EC\\] 100 mg/m² and 3 cycles of docetaxel 60 mg/m2) in the previous hospital. The tumor was in-vasive ductal carcinoma， locus C. It was strongly positive for hu-man epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and negative for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR). The pa-tient received adjuvant chemotherapy (3 cycles of EC 80 mg/m²， triweekly trastuzumab for 19 cycles， and 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine600 mg/d for 5 months). The patient was a hepatitis B carrier. She did not have a history of cigarette， alcohol， or illicit substance use.\n\n【11】The patient was referred to our hospital after she noticed ede ma in her upper and lower limbs and underwent chest im-aging that revealed a cystic thymoma . The lumbar metastatic lesion was judged to be controlled because F\\]2-fluoro-2deoxy-D-glucose accumulation on positron emission tomography-computed tomography before treatment had dis-appeared ， and breast cancer markers were not el-evated. Whole-body analysis revealed a nodule suspected to be a metastatic liver tumor in the right lobe. Based on biopsy， it was diagnosed as breast cancer metastasis.\n\n【12】It had not metastasized from the mediastinal tumor， so we de-cided to perform a surgical intervention for the mediastinal tumor because it was suspected to be a primary lesion. We planned to conduct an intraoperative rapid diagnosis of the mediastinal tumor and to resect it if the diagnosis supported that it was a primary tumor.\n\n【13】Surgery and pathologicat results\n\n【14】Thoracoscopic biopsy was performed. Rapid diagnosis re-vealed a lymphocyte-predominant tumor tissue， which couldnot be used to differentiate between lymphoma and lympho-cytic thymoma. The operation was continued because the tu-mor was clinically likely to be a thymoma. Initially， the oper-ation was performed under thoracoscopy， but the tumor was invading the left brachiocephalic vein and left phrenic nerve. Therefore，open resection was performed by switching to me-dian sternotomy. The patient was discharged on postopera-tive day 10 without any complications. The tumor was iden-tified as adenocarcinoma and was strongly positive for HER2and negative for ER and PR， which mirrored the primary le-sion . The final diagnosis was metastatic breast can-cer of the mediastinum.\n\n【15】Systemic treatment was considered necessary because of re-maining metastatic lesions in the liver， but the patient re-fused treatment and interrupted consultation. We ultimately lost contact with her.\n\n【16】Case 2\n\n【17】A 47-year-old Asian woman presented with a medical histo-ry including breast cancer. She was a former smoker with 100pack-years， and she drank alcohol occasionally. She had no his-tory of illicit substance use. Fifteen years earlier， she received a diagnosis of stage I cancer of the right breast and under-went right partial mastectomy and axillary dissection. The tu-mor was papillotubular carcinoma. It was positive for ER and PR and negative for HER2. The patient received postoperative radiotherapy and endocrine therapy (goserelin for 2 years and tamoxifen for 5 years). At the final consultation 5 years prior to her current presentation， she showed no recurrence.\n\n【18】She was referred to the outpatient department because she was experiencing left upper limb edema and precordial pain. An anterior mediastinal tumor was found to be invading the left brachiocephalic vein directly and causing a thrombotic occlusion . Among laboratory tests， only the CA15-3 level was slightly elevated (41.2 U/mL). Resection was not the first choice of treatment even if the tumor was a primary tumor. Additionally， based on case 1， we viewed a minimally invasive diagnostic modality as being paramount； therefore， we planned a biopsy first.\n\n【19】Surgery and pathological results\n\n【20】A tumor biopsy was performed through a small transverse neck incision， and rapid diagnosis only confirmed the presence of the tumor tissue. The patient was discharged on postopera-tive day 2 without any complications. The tumor was an ade-nocarcinoma that was positive for ER and negative for PR and HER2 ， and the final diagnosis was metastatic breast cancer of the mediastinum. The patient received endocrine therapy (goserelin and tamoxifen) for 1 year， but progressivedisease then developed. The patient’s treatment regimen was changed to goserelin， fulvestrant， and palbociclib. She is cur-rently continuing this treatment， 16 months after the biopsy.\n\n【21】Discussion\n\n【22】Hess et al.  reported that 6% of breast cancers metasta-size to the mediastinum and then to the axillary lymph nodes， bone， liver， lungs， sternoclavicular lymph nodes， brain， and pleura. The mediastinum is a less common metastatic site for breast cancer， but 11% of metastatic tumors in the medias-tinum are breast cancers， followed by lung and kidney can-cers . In addition， the postoperative recurrence rate of breast cancer is 4.4% after >10 years ， and according to Japanese statistics， 0.1% after>20 years . Recent improvements intreatment outcomes suggest that recurrence can occur over a longer period. Given the low frequency of primary medias-tina! tumors， breast cancer metastasis should be considered if the patient has a history of breast cancer. If breast cancer has also spread to other organs at the same time， especial-ly to the lung， a mediastinal tumor is more likely to be breast cancer . In these cases， the treatment should be as mini-mally invasive as possible. Although breast cancer does me-tastasize to the mediastinum， solitary mediastinal metastases are rarely reported  and differential diagnosis from primary mediastinal tumor will be difficu lt.\n\n【23】If the relapse is in the form of mediastinal oligometastasis， it remains unclear whether resection is the appropriate action to take. However， it has been reported to be effective ， which should be taken into account.\n\n【24】In another case in our experience， which involved a 47-year-old woman with a diagnosis of stage l cancer of the right breast， chest imaging at the time of diagnosis revealed a mediastinal tumor in the superior portion of the mediastinum . We performed tumorectomy through a small transverse neck incision. Although thymoma rarely occurs in the superior por-tion of the mediastinum ， the final pathological diagnosis was in fact thymoma， in contrast to the 2 cases presented in the current report. Consequently， we note that a history of breast cancer does not seem to preclude the possibility of thymoma occurring. In any case， it is important to avoid unnecessaryinvasive procedures and their postoperative disadvantages in patients with metastatic breast cancer of the mediastinum.\n\n【25】Conclusions\n\n【26】In patients suspected to have a primary mediastinal tumor on imaging， the possibility of metastatic tumor should also be considered if the patients have a history of breast cancer， regardless of how long in the past it was.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The rupture of esophageal varices is the leading cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in cirrhosis. It occurs in about 30 to 40% of patients with liver cirrhosis and esophageal varices. A multidisciplinary approach is needed as it is a life-threatening condition. Trans-jugular intra-hepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is the elected procedure in the management of refractory bleeding to drug and endoscopic treatment.\n\n【1】We report the case of the casual discovery of splenic arteriovenous fistula while performing TIPS in the context of alcoholic liver cirrhosis associating oesophageal varices and portal hypertension.\n\n【2】KEYWORDS transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt， arteriovenous fistula， cirrhosis， portal hypertension\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Portal hypertension is one of the most significant complications of both acute and chronic liver diseases. It results from an in-crease in vascular resistance at the prehepatic， intrahepatic， or postherpetic level. Gastroesophageal varices are the most impor-tant clinical manifestation of this syndrome and are associated with a high risk of hemorrhage and mortality. However， in the refractory cases， other causes of upper gastrointestinal hemor-rhage should be ruled out. \n\n【5】Case report\n\n【6】This is a 45-year-old woman admitted to our emergency depart-ment for hematemesis starting in the morning. Her medical history was relevant for alcoholic liver cirrhosis with gastroe-sophageal varices (CHILD PUGH stage 3)， previous gastric by-pass surgery complicated by a perforated gastric ulcer and acute alcoholic pancreatitis three months ago.\n\n【7】Upon admission to the emergency department， the physical exam revealed altered mental status， sinus tachycardia (140bpm) and hypotension (80/60 mmHg). The cardiorespiratory exam was normal. Abdominal showed abundant ascites (grade 3). During the examination， the patient presented a new episode of hematemesis. The patient was subsequently sedated and intubated to protect the airway.\n\n【8】The laboratory panel showed severe anaemia (Hb 5.8g/dl)， thrombocytopenia (98000 mm3)， prothrombin time(69%)， hy-perlactacidemia (5.4 mmol /L)， slightly increase of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase (47U/L each) as well as elevated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase(156U/l). Ethanol level was 2.25g/dl.\n\n【9】An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was describing the pres-ence of esophageal varices stage 3 treated with five elastic lig-atures. The patient received three units of blood and one of platelets before she was transferred to the intensive care unit(ICU).\n\n【10】At ICU， treatment with continuous proton pump inhibitor(pantoprazole) perfusion， somatostatin perfusion (3 mg per day) and antibi prophylaxis with ceftriaxone 1 gr daily.Five litres of fluid were withdrawn by abdominal paracentesis and human albumin solutions administered.\n\n【11】During her stay at the ICU， haematemesis recurred being managed by endoscopic sclerosis， clipping and ligatures of the varices. Forty-eight hours after these procedures were per-formed； the patient presented a new episode of hematemesis. In this setting， a metal prosthesis (Danis Stent) was placed by the endoscopic procedure . At three day， the patient was hemodynamically stable， she was extubated and the prosthesis removed at day five.She was transferred to internal medicine.\n\n【12】Unfortunately， one week after， the patient presented a new episode of haematemesis leading to hemorrhagic shock. She was readmitted to the ICU， and after a multidisciplinary ap-proach (gastroenterologists， anesthesiologists and interventional radiologists) the performance of TIPS was retained.\n\n【13】The hepatic catheterization was difficult owing to the high portal pressures； the catheter is blocked at the sus-hepatic level， and there is absence of opacification of the portal vein. The sono-graphic Doppler study showed permeability of the sus-hepatic and portal veins. The investigations were completed with an abdominal computed tomography revealing the existence of a splenic arteriovenous communication between the hilum of the spleen leading to an opacification of the splanchnic venous system and subsequently explaining the high pressure.\n\n【14】Selective catheterization of the splenic artery confirmed the arteriovenous fistula in the hilum of the spleen. Considering the tortuous aspect of the splenic artery， only the proximal splenic artery is occluded . The absence of hemateme-sis marked the clinical course and the patient was released from the ICU after three weeks of stay.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Portal hypertension (PHT) is a life-threatening condition， as in the case reported. Numerous causes of portal hypertension ex-ist. The aetiology can be classified as prehepatic (portal vein thrombosis， splenic， arteriovenous fistula)， intrahepatic (primary biliary cholangitis， sarcoidosis， liver fibrosis， cirrhosis)， or pos-thepatic reasons (Budd-Chiari syndrome). Cirrhosis is the most common cause of portal hypertension in industrialized countries. Nevertheless， many other pathologies can be at its origin， leading to a diagnostic pitfall.\n\n【17】Particularly in the case reported， the management was fo-cused on the variceal disease in cirrhosis but in the presence of another entity lately diagnosed and also contributing to por-tal hypertension. As a result， portal hypertension was due to cirrhosis and arteriovenous fistula.\n\n【18】The primary complications of PHT are gastrointestinal bleed-ing， ascites and hepatic encephalopathy. Gastrointestinal bleed-ing is a frequent and severe complication of PHT being oe-sophageal varices ruptures the most common cause. It occurs in30% to 40% of cirrhotic patients with oesophageal varices， and it is associated with 20% short-term mortality. Several factors of poor prognosis have been described： impaired liver func-tion， PHT greater than 20 mmHg， active bleeding at endoscopy. Treatment of oesophageal varices rupture is well codified by the French and American consensus conferences and the recommen-dations of Baveno， protocols include： protection of the airways， fluid resuscitation， blood transfusion， prophylactic antibiotic therapy， vasoactive treatment (somatostatin， Terlipressine) and mechanic bleeding control by endoscopy (ligature and clip).\n\n【19】In 10 to 20% of cases， the haemorrhage is refractory to drug and endoscopic treatment， as shown in the case of our patient so the use of a self-expansive metal esophageal prosthesis could be recommended. This procedure allows an immediate bleed-ing control， and subsequently clinical improvement before tran-sjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) or the liver transplantation could be performed. In the case of refractory hemorrhage， interventional radiological TIPS could be a useful option as in this case.\n\n【20】This procedure was challenging to perform because of high pressure in the portal system. This fact incidentally revealed the presence of an arteriovenous fistula in this patient in whom the PHT was initially attributed exclusively to cirrhosis. Arteriove-nous fistulas are uncommon， and they could be either congenital or secondarily to a surgical procedure， a biopsy puncture or aneurysmal pathology. Fistulas are commonly located in the splenic hilum or the splenic trunk. They are generally revealed by an array of portal hypertension due to excess blood supply in the portal system， depending on the size of the arteriovenous communication. Diagnosis is confirmed by computed tomog-raphy or magnetic resonance imaging with contrast injection. Interventional radiological embolization is the first choice of treatment， but the endovascular occlusion of the splenic artery could lead to complications such as massive splenic infarction progressing to an abscess， septic shock， or splenic rupture. If this procedure fails， splenectomy could be considered.\n\n【21】In this case， the previous history of complicated gastric by-pass surgery complicated probably contributed to the occurrence of the arteriovenous fistula. Its embolization has prevented the recurrence of oesophageal varices rupture by drastic diminish-ing portal hypertension.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】Upper gastrointestinal bleedings are one of the most common complications of the cirrhosis and more generally of portal hy-pertension. It associated with high-level mortality.In case of refractory bleeding not responding to treatment other etiologies of portal hypertension should be considered.\n\n【24】Learning points\n\n【25】· In the case of refractory upper gastrointestinal bleeding to conventional treatment， other etiologies must be ruled out\n\n【26】·Portal hypertension is a complex entity\n\n【27】·Arteriovenous fistula could be at the origin of refractory upper gastrointestinal bleedings", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

To resolve pleural effusion， prolonged chest tube placement is often re-quired. Anti-inflammatory agents combined with diuretics are also often prescribed. Saireito， a Japanese herbal medication， which is a combination of Goreisan and Shousaikoto， has both anti-inflammatory and water-mod-ulation properties and has been used for edema (lymph edema， cerebral edema) and inflammation (chronic nephritis).\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】We describe a 71-year-old woman with a history of syncope and bradycardia who underwent dual permanent pacemaker implantation (placed in the right chest because of a persistent left superior vena cava) without com-plications. Two months later， she came to the hospital as an outpatient with a dry cough， and was diagnosed with right-sided pleural effusion. A pleural fluid analysis revealed exudative effusion， according to Light’s cri-teria. The fluid was negative for infectious etiology. Chest X-ray， computed tomography， and echocardiography revealed no signs of pericardial effusion or perforation of the pacemaker lead to outside the heart. The pleu-ral effusion persisted despite use of anti-inflammatory medication for several weeks and diuretics for a short period. Saireito was administered with good response； the pleural effusion resolved completely and there was no deterioration of renal function.\n\n【4】Conclusions\n\n【5】The present case highlights the clinical significance of Saireito as an effective therapeutic agent for late-onset pacemaker-related pleural effusion， without adverse effects such as renal dysfunction\n\n【6】Keywords： Drugs， Chinese Herbal· Pacemaker， Artificial· Pleural Effusion\n\n【7】Pacemaker implantation is a standard and safe therapeutic strategy for patients of all ages with bradyarrhythmia. Various complications associated with pacemaker implantation are common， but late-onset pacemaker-related pleural effusion is rarely reported . Recently， Xiong et al reported 6 consec-utive elderly patients with pleural effusion who had under-gone a new pacemaker implantation and evaluated the clinical characteristics and therapeutic courses of pleural effusion . According to their report， cases of late-onset pacemaker-re-lated pleural effusion were treatment-resistant； patients had to be hospitalized repeatedly with thoracentesis because con-ventional treatments including diuretics and anti-inflammato-ry agents had only short-term effects， similar to a case report-ed by Shaukat et al .\n\n【8】Saireito (TJ-114) is a combination of 2 herbal medications， Shousaikoto and Goreisan. Shousaikoto is known as a rem-edy for hepatitis， and previous investigations have report-ed that Shousaikoto has potential as an anti-inflammatory drug . In addition， Goreisan has been reported to be effec-tive for hydrostatic modulation via the suppression of aqua-porin 4. Therefore， Saireito has both anti-inflammatory andwater-utilization benefits. Saireito is composed of 12 crude drugs： 7 g of saiko， 5 g of takusha， 5 g of hange， 3 g of ou-gon，3 g of soujutu， 3 g of taisou， 3 g of chorei， 3 g of ninjin， 3g of bukuryo， 2 g of kanzo， 2 g of keihi， and 1 g of shoukyou. Takusha， soujutu， chorei， and bukuyrou， the main components of Goreisan， have an effect on regulating the amount of wa-ter in the body. Saiko and ougon， components of Shousaikoto， have anti-inflammatory effects. Saireito has been used in the treatment of chronic kidney disease， diarrhea， acute gastritis， and various edematous disorders， such as subdural hematoma， chronic lymphedema， cirrhosis， and general edema. Saireito has also widely been used to treat various inflammatory diseases， such as rheumatoid arthritis . Recently， herbal medications have been attracting attention for their effectiveness in circu-latory disease； however， the association between the use of herbal medication and pleural effusion has not been well doc-umented. We had a case in which Saireito was effective for the treatment of late-onset pacemaker-related pleural effusion.\n\n【9】Case Report\n\n【10】A 71-year-old woman who had been previously well and had no significant past medical history was admitted to ourrevealed no pleural effusion. She was discharged in 13 days without any complications.\n\n【11】Table 1. Laboratory data on patient's first admission revealed only mild hypokalemia.

On admission， she regained consciousness， but her blood pressure was elevated to 212/76 mm Hg and her heart rate was 63 beats/min. She did not have a heart murmur. The laboratory tests showed no abnormalities .\n\n【14】The electrocardiogram on admission showed normal sinus rhythm， with a left branch anterior bundle block， and high voltage of the left ventricle， with secondary ST-T changes. The chest X-ray exhibited cardiomegaly. There was no indication of pneumonia or heart failure . The electrocardiogram monitoring in the hospital revealed a prolonged R-R interval of 6040 ms， associated with fainting. From these findings， she was diagnosed with sick sinus syndrome type ll. Echocardiography conducted 6 days before pacemaker implantation revealed normal function with mild left hypertrophy and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.\n\n【15】A previous venography of the subclavian vein revealed a per-sistent left superior vena cava. Therefore， a permanent dual chamber pacemaker was implanted under fluoroscopic guidance in the right chest. Venous access was achieved by puncture of the subclavian vein， and both leads were endocardial screw-in leads. The setting rate of the implanted pacemaker was 60to 130 pulses per min.

The chest X-ray and computerized tomography revealed right-sided pleural effusion . An echocardiogram showed no sign of pericardial effusion or perforation of the myocar-dium and was nearly identical to a previous echocardiogram. Thoracentesis was performed， and the fluid composition was exudative effusion， according to Light's criteria . A pleu-ral fluid analysis was negative for infectious etiology， includ-ing mycobacteria， and there were no findings of malignancy. After thoracentesis， right-sided pleural effusion remained al-most the same as before . A pacemaker interroga-tion revealed no abnormality. We considered that the pleural effusion was a manifestation of a pacemaker-associated injury.\n\n【20】Therefore， we initiated an oral anti-inflammatory agent (ac-etaminophen 600 mg/day)， and oral diuretics (furosemide 40mg/day) as an initial dose， then as needed for a short period. With these treatments， the pleural effusion decreased some-what； however， persistent right pleural effusion was present2 months later . Furthermore， the patient's re-nal function deteriorated slightly .\n\n【21】To decrease pleural effusion and prevent further deteriora-tion of renal function， we prescribed oral Saireito (an herbal substitute for anti-inflammatory agents and diuretics) at an initial dose of 9 g/day， because long-term use of anti-inflam-matory agents and diuretics often causes renal damage. We also wanted to avoid the use of steroids， considering her age. Right pleural effusion completely disappeared 1 month after the administration of Saireito . The patient's renal function was also maintained . The patient has been followed as an outpatient and has been well and free from re-current pleural effusion.\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】In the present case， Saireito， a Japanese traditional herbal med-ication， played an important role in reducing pleural effusion that occurred 2 months after the implantation of a dual cham-ber pacemaker， without deterioration of renal function. Various drugs used in modern medicine can have adverse effects， such as renal dysfunction. Therefore， in some medical situations， traditional herbal medication is often used as an alternative to prevent adverse events . Aquaporin (AQP) is a water chan-nel and is composed of at least 13 types of isoforms. Goreisan strongly inhibits AQP3， AQP4， and AQP5 . Interestingly，unlike western diuretics， Goreisan induces an increase of urine volume in an edematous state， but not in a dehydrated state. The precise pharmacological mechanisms of traditional herb-al medications， such as Saireito and Goreisan， remain to be elucidated . The use of herbal medications has attracted more attention in recent years . To treat congestive heart failure， Mokubouito or Shakannzouto have often been used in addition to standard therapy， and Goreisan has been used to treat edematous states Saireito has been used for di-arrhea， chronic renal disease， lymphedema，and cerebral ede-ma. In addition， according to Takei et al， Saireito and Boiogito can improve hypertension .\n\n【24】Shousaikoto has potential as an anti-inflammatory treatment， and has been used for pneumonia， bronchitis， lymphadenitis， and chronic hepatitis. Therefore， we hypothesized that Saireito， being a combination of Goreisan and Shousaikoto， might be effective in both edematous and inflammatory states， such as in the present case \n\n【25】Late-onset pacemaker-related pleural effusion is rare and of-ten difficult to treat. Conventional medical treatment，including anti-inflammatory agents， colchicine， and diuretics often have little effect on late-onset pacemaker-related pleural effusion. Therefore， repeated therapeutic thoracentesis is unavoidable in some cases. In the present case， pleural effusion persisted after 2 months of an anti-inflammatory agent and diuretics. Considering not only its effectiveness， but also its renal pro-tective properties， Saireito was administered，and the pleural effusion disappeared completely， without deterioration of renalfunction . It is worth noting that Saireito attenuates renal damage induced by diuretics. In the present case， renal protection was one of the reasons for selecting Saireito ver-sus alternative traditional anti-inflammatory agents or diuret-ics. Our patient's pleural effusion completely resolved，and re nal function was maintained.\n\n【26】Conclusions\n\n【27】In conclusion， our experience indicates that the use of Saireito could resolve treatment-resistant pleural effusion as a de-layed complication of pacemaker implantation， without dete-rioration of renal function. Whether Goreisan or Shousaikoto alone have the same effect as Saireito remains to be evalu-ated. Further study is required to examine the use of these agents alone for pleural effusion as a delayed complication of permanent pacemaker implantation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

(ii) To identify host & epidemiological factors that affect disease occurrence. (iii)To isolate & identify dermatophytes from clinically suspected cases of tinea & to correlate their occurrence with the epidemiological factors. Materials & Methods： A total of 260 scrapings from skin， scalp & nails were taken from clinically suspected cases of tinea attending the OPD of a tertiary care hospital in Gujarat， India. Direct examination with KOH mount was done. The scrapings were cultured on SDA & identified based on their morphologies & biochemical reactions. Results： Of the total260 specimens， KOH positivity was 34.61% & culture positivity was 28.84%. Females(50.38%) were affected more than males(49.61%) & maximum cases of tinea were present in 31-40 years(21.46%) age group. Housewives(36.15%) & daily wagers(18.84%) were the most inflicted occupational groups. Maximum specimens were from skin(36.15%)， followed by nails(33.46%) & hairs(30.38%).T. capitis & T. corporis were the commonest clinical types identified， with T. capitis majorly present in the paediatric(< 10 years) age group(49.29%). Maximum isolates of dermatophytes were T. violaceum(29.33%)， followed by T. mentagrophytes(24%) & T. rubrum(12%). Conclusion： In India， T.mentagrophytes & T.rubrum have been found to be more common， but in our study， T.violaceum was the most common dermatophyte isolated due to more number of T. capitis cases. Activities that involve laborious tasks make a person more prone to dermatophytosis.

The high population density in the Indian set-up， poverty， lack of educa-tion， and insanitation add to it. The present study was under-taken to identify the common dermatophytes causing infection among the study groups， especially in this part of western India， as there have been very few studies concerning clinicomycologi-cal & epidemiological profiles of dermatophytosis. The variable climatic conditions in Ahmedabad， with increasing levels of humidity encountered in summers each year and the succeed-ing monsoons， appeared to be fertile nurseries for the dermato-phytes to infect. The study was done to identify these factors &establish their relation with Tinea infection.\n\n【4】Materials & Methods\n\n【5】A cross-sectional study was conducted on patients attending the OutPatient Department of Dermatology. Total 260 patients presented with skin， hair(scalp) & nail infections.\n\n【6】Inclusion criteria\n\n【7】All patients of both genders & all age groups with skin/hair/nail infections & with clinical suspicion of dermatophytosis， & who gave consent for participation were included in the study.\n\n【8】Exclusion criteria\n\n【9】All patients who did not give consent for participation & those who were already on topical/oral/ systemic antifungal treat-ment were excluded from the study.\n\n【10】Sample collection\n\n【11】Scrapings were collected from skin， scalp， hairs and nails of260 clinically suspected cases of tinea. The participants were explained the procedure of scrapping (scalp， skin & nails) in the language they understood. A designated room with adequate light was allotted to ensure patients privacy. The patients'clin-ical history and demographic data were elicited thoroughly &recorded in a pre-designed Case record form. The scrapings were taken in an adequately illuminated room after ensuring adequate exposure of the affected site on the patients' bodies. The presence of a male/ female attendant/ nurse was ensured whenever was required. After wearing sterile gloves， the lesion was first disinfected with 70% alcohol， going from centre to the periphery of the lesion. The alcohol was allowed to dry. Then， the following scrapings were taken with a sterile blade：i. Scalp： The hair was plucked if possible， or stubs of hair were secured to identify endothrix or ectothrix infection.\n\n【12】ii. Nail： Subungual debris or any chalky material was collected. Discolored or disfigured nail plate was also scrapped.\n\n【13】iii. Skin： Site of active inflammation evident by the presence of scaly patches with sharply demarcated margins.\n\n【14】The scrapings were taken with the blunt edge of the sterile blade， using the sharp edge as and when required. The lesion was scrapped from periphery to centre.\n\n【15】The scrapings were taken in a sterile petri dish and then trans-ported in sterile(autoclaved) black paper to the microbiology laboratory.\n\n【16】Procedure performed in the mycology lab\n\n【17】The scrapings received were divided into 3 parts. The first was used to inoculate Sabouraud’s Dextrose Agar(SDA) with chlo-ramphenicol(Himedia) in duplicate； the second was inoculated in 1 ml of 10% KOH(hair， skin) or 40% KOH(nails)4.5 & the third part was used to prepare KOH mount for direct examination.\n\n【18】The SDA cultures were examined daily for initial 5 days to identify any contamination or early growth. After that， they were examined twice a week for a total of 4 weeks. If any growth was identified， the characteristics， viz.， the colour of the obverse and the reverse， and the texture of growth were noted. The primary growth was subcultured， and a cellophane preparation with Lacto Phenol Cotton Blue(LPCB) was made to examine the macroconidia， microconidia and other special hyphal struc-tures. A urease test was performed to differentiate between T. rubrum and T. mentagrophytes.6 The development of brightand deep pink colour was considered a positive reaction by T.\n\n【19】mentagrophytes， T. violaceum， T. tonsurans & E. floccosum6.78\n\n【20】Statistical analyses were done using Microsoft Excel. Signifi-cance levels were assessed at p<0.05；by using the x-test.\n\n【21】40X\n\n【22】Results\n\n【23】Total participants enrolled in the study were 260， of which129(49.61%) were males & 131(50.38%) were females. The most common age group affected was 31-40 years (21.46%).Maximum number of samples were drawn from 0-40 yrs age group(81.92%). The youngest patient was 1 year old with T. capitis and isolating T. violaceum. The mean age was 30.31+ 17.74 years.

Among the KOH positives， there were 13 Malassezia spp. & 7 Candida spp. isolated.\n\n【33】Among the specimens collected， 94(36.15%) were from the skin， 87(33.46%) from nails & 79(30.38%) were from the scalp(hair).\n\n【34】Clinically， T. capitis (71， 40.11%) was the most frequent di-agnosis， followed by T. unguinum (35，19.77%) & T. corporis(33，18.64%).2(1.12%) cases of T. incognito were also identified. T. capitis was most common in the 0-10 yrs age group whichlaceum(22，29.33%)， followed by T. mentagrophytes(18，24%)& T. rubrum(9，12%). Only 2 isolates of T. tonsurans were identified， both in paediatric patients. One isolate each of E. floccosum & M. canis was identified.\n\n【35】The majority of T. capitis &T. corporis cases had isolates of T.\n\n【36】violaceum， T. mentagrophytes & T. rubrum； which was significant\n\n【37】T.mentagrophytes was isolated in a case of Tincognito with the patient having H/O local steroid application for some skin con-dition.

Itching was the most common(153，58.84%) complaint， followed by crusting ofle sions(101，38.84%). In the case of T.capitis， all black-dot patterns identified had T. violaceum as the causative species. T. corporis was more frequently present in females than males &it was significant compared to other clinical types of tinea.(x²-5.8567，p-value<0.0155)\n\n【39】Family history of similar complaints was present in 13(5%) cases， and all were culture positive for dermatophytes. How-ever， considering the culture-positive samples of cases without a family history， the finding was non-significant(x， with Yates correction- 3.1243， p-value 0.077)\n\n【40】Past history of similar complaints was present in 18(6.92%) patients & of them， 7(38.88%) were culture positive. This finding was significant (x--7.5812， p-value -0.005898)\n\n【41】The most frequently isolated dermatophyte was T. vio-\n\n【42】The months of August and September registered maximum cases of Tinea.(91，35%，N=260)\n\n【43】Starting with gender， in our study， females were more frequently infected with dermatophytosis； the female： male ratio being1.01：1. But the positivity rates were higher in males(32.55%)than females(25.19%) in the present study. In the majority of studies， males have been found to be more commonly affected by der-matophytosis in comparison to females This finding has been attributed to males' outdoor and strenous work patterns. However， some studies have identified a higher incidence of dermatophytosis in females than in males. In our study， a major chunk(36.15%) of patients were housewives. The delay in seeking treatment may be a reason for this increased incidence in the study. In addition， the occupation of the patient impacted the occurrence of dermatophytosis. Many studies have identi-fied housewives/homemakers as the most commonly affected groupl10，13 and daily wagers and workers 14，15. The most fre-quently infected age group was 31-40 years (21.46%). Similar findings were seen in other studies. The 21-40 years age group had a maximum number of cases in our study(41.80%)， which was also present in the study done by Poluri et a1. This can be because the 21-40 years age group represents the main working population. Culture positivity rates varied in different studies. But the common pattern of culture-positive specimens being lesser than KOH(direct microscopy) positive specimens has been consistent This may be because of the environmental fungal contaminants growing on SDA during a longer incubation period needed to grow dermatophytes.\n\n【44】Among the different specimens， the study done by Negi et al.also had maximum specimens of the skin followed by nails and hairs. The maximum number of growths in culture were seen in skin samples， as was the finding in the study done by Balamuruganvelu et al. & Mulla et a. This may be attributed to more pronounced itching on the body and cosmetic discomfort leading to the patient seeking treatment.\n\n【45】In our study， hair specimens had a positivity rate of 30.37%， with the major isolates being T. violaceum.In cases of T. capitis， the black-dot pattern of hair loss was found to be a consistent sign related to the isolation of T. violaceuml19，20l； all cases with a black-dot pattern having T.violaceum as the etiological agent. T. violaceum was the most common isolate in T. capitis in < 10years age group； 86.36% of it was isolated from scalp specimens. This finding is supported by studies done by Poluri et al. &Balamuruganvelu et a1.Increased secretion by the glands in the scalp at the onset of puberty may be the reason for this 211The higher number of cases & high positivity rate of T. capitis explains the maximum number of T. violaceum isolated in this study.\n\n【46】The lower incidence of T. mannum &T. pedis may be due to the thick keratin layer.\n\n【47】T. mentagrophutes and T.rubrum are the most common iso-lates in India in many studiesl. Candida and P. ver-sicolor formed 9.33% and 17.33% of the total positive isolates， respectively. A study by Patel et al. also identified P. versi-color(22.67%) and candida(10.67%) as causal agents.\n\n【48】The majority of the cases of fungal infection were recorded in August & September. This may be due to the seasonal clubbing of monsoons & summers providing a perfect humid atmosphere conducive for dermatophytes.\n\n【49】Notable is the isolation of zoophillic fungi M.canis and\n\n【50】I.mentagrophytes var.\n\n【51】mentagrophytes in 1.15% of the cases.\n\n【52】The patients came with C/O severe itching over a very short duration(10-15 days)， the finding being consistent with zoophilic fungi.\n\n【53】Conclusion\n\n【54】Dermatophytosis infection is more common in adults (above20 yrs). In India， T.mentagrophytes & T.rubrum are more com-mon. However， in our study， T.violaceum was the commonest dermatophyte isolated due to more T. capitis cases. The activi-ties involving laborious tasks cause intense sweating， making a person more prone to dermatophyte infection. Hence， better and increased practices of self-hygiene can help to reduce the incidence and alongwith community education can limit the spread of tinea within a family. The laboratory procedure fol-lowed was satisfactory， with SDA proving to be a good medium for routine culturing & primary isolation. Seasonal variations affect the dermatophytes greatly. Therefore， increased measures can be implemented before this infection's peak season.\n\n【55】All these findings have not been thoroughly identified in this geographic region；i.e.， translational research has not been done to the best of the author's knowledge. Therefore， the author seeks to encourage and implement measures to reduce the burden of dermatophytosis by targeting the epidemiological factors with a significant effect on disease causation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

A case study in the literature describ-ing isolated unilateral retinal cholesterol embolism after coronary angiography has been reported. To our knowledge， isolated retinal cholesterol embolism with central or branch retinal artery occlusion post carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) leading to permanent visual loss， has not been previously described.\n\n【10】CASE REPORT\n\n【11】A 73 year old male， with a prior history of transient ischemic events (TIA’s) and hypertension presented with a history of a near syncopal attack. The pa-tient had been on antihypertensive and anti-platelet medication prior to admission. He was normotensive without focal neurologic deficit. His fundoscopic examination was unremarkable. The cholesterol level was normal.\n\n【12】A non-contrast CT scan of the brain revealed an old right caudate nucleus infarct. A neurocranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study corrobo-rated this finding without identification of an acute ischemic event. A magnetic resonance angiography(MRA) study of the carotid vessels was significant for bilateral high-grade proximal internal carotid artery(ICA) stenosis.\n\n【13】Conventional cervicocrainial angiography revealed95%-99% right proximal ICA stenosis. 90% stenosis of the left proximal ICA was present. No significant atherosclerotic stenosis of the basi-vertebral vessels was identified. The right ICA stenosis was surgically inaccessible. A decision to angioplasty and stent the right internal carotid artery was made in consultation with the patient.\n\n【14】Appropriate verbal and written consent was obtained. The procedure was performed under monitored con-scious sedation with full systemic anticoagulation. A loading dose of clopidrigol (Plavix； Bristol-Myers Squibb/Sanofi Pharmaceuticals， New York， NY) was administered orally. Pre stent angioplasty was performed with a 4 mm Symmetry balloon (Boston Scientific， Fremont， CA). A Smart stent 9 mm x 40 mm(Cordis， Miami， FL) was implanted across the stenosis. Post stent deployment angioplasty using an Opta 6mm(Cordis，Miami， FL) balloon was performed for focal residual stenosis. At the termination of the procedure， a small thrombus was noted at the proximal aspect ofthe stent. No neurologic deficit was noted after the procedure. He was placed on an overnight heparin infusion with continued administration of oral aspirin and clopidrigol (Plavix； Bristol-Myers Squibb/Sanofi Pharmaceuticals， New York， NY).\n\n【15】The patient complained of painless sudden right vi-sual acuity change (20/2) with absent light perception thirty hours after the procedure. Visual evaluation of the right fundus revealed ischemic changes character-ized by macula cherry-red spot from probable central retinal artery occlusion， as well as multiple choles terol emboli.“Box-car” appearance of the arteries and veins suggestive of severe retinal ischemia was also noted. The neurologic evaluation was otherwise unremarkable.\n\n【16】Conservative management for central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) with ocular massage， acetazolo-mide and topical Beta-blocker was initiated. The patient refused anterior chamber paracentesis. On follow up， right eye visual loss was permanent.\n\n【17】DISCUSSION\n\n【18】Cholesterol embolization syndrome (CES) consists of systemic atheroembolism that occurs within eight weeks after iatrogenic disruption of susceptible aortic ul-cerative atheromatous plaque. CES is characterized by a systemic inflammatory response as identified clinically by fever， myalgia weight loss and an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) . This is accompanied by multi organ embolic sequalae that predominantly but not singularly consists of peripheral vascular ischemic changes (blue toe syndrome)， skin changes (levido reticularis) and renal failure . Histologic changes are identified in nearly every organ system and may also include visual changes from retinal emboli . This syndrome occurs more frequently in patients with generalized athero-sclerosis and cerebrovascular disease  and is difficult to manage with a poor overall prognosis.\n\n【19】Retinal cholesterol emboli may occur as part of the syndrome or independently without the systemic manifestations. Retinal cholesterol crystal emboli most commonly arise from atheromatous plaques at the ipsilateral carotid bifurcation or aorta， often spontanousely and may raise suspicion for impending strokes . A case report of isolated retinal choles-terol emboli without the syndromic systemic sequalae following diagnostic coronary angiography has been reported . Retinal branch artery occlusion after percutanous transluminal coronary angioplasty with atherectomy has also been reported . Delayed isolated retinal cholesterol emboli after endovas-cular carotid angioplasty with central retinal arteryocclusion (CRAO) and permanent visual loss has to our knowledge not previously been described.\n\n【20】Retinal vascular occlusions from cholesterol emboli result from thrombus attached to the cholesterol crystal or from fibrosis due to recurrent emboli . Fundoscopic evaluation of Hollenhorst (cholesterol) plaques is quite distinctive revealing focal bright， re-fractive yellow-orange plaques in the retina. However， even amongst ophthalmologists the ability to differ-entiate varied types of retinal emboli that include platelet/fibrin thrombi， calcification and cholesterol emboli is poor . Therefore， in our case the pos-sibility mixed component emboli resulting in retinal ischemia is most likely.\n\n【21】Carotid atheromatous plaque with ulcerative features is thought to shower intra plaque cholesterol and other particulate material into the microcirculation within the retina where they become lodged at vessel bifurcations resulting in ischemic changes. Retinal emboli can be visually identified in about 20 percent of patients with CRAO. Medical and minimally in-vasive treatment of such embolic occlusion is rarelv effective  and consists of anterior chamber para-centesis， optic globe massage， acetazolomide， topi-cal Beta-blocker and other measures. The success of local ophthalmic intra-arterial fibrinolysis is limited by factors such as patient age， duration of occlusion， stage of occlusion， number of occluded branches and the occluding material that includes platelet-fibrin， calcific and cholesterol emboli . Invasive fibrinolytic management is controversial with limited evidence of visual acuity change  and may be futile against delayed cholesterol emboli.\n\n【22】Carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) is associated with intra and peri-procedural embolism with ischemic sequalae that range in frequency from 3 to 13% . Identification of patients at risk for embolic phenom-enon prior to angioplasty and stenting is important in the procedural planning. Symptomatic stenosis and paradoxically， the absence of hypercholestrolemia have been identified as potential pre-procedural identifiable risk factors . Interestingly， systemic factors and comorbidities increase the risk for carotidendarterectomy and local lesion attributes both ana-tomic and pathological increase the risk for CAS . Embolic phenomenon occur with rupture of athero-matous plaque immediately after balloon deflation and subsequent release of plaque content ，includ-ing cholesterol emboli for which peri-interventional antiplatelet medications are unlikely to reduce . Atheromatous plaques are a mixture of cholesterol crystals and lipoid masses， the former of which occur in higher numbers within ulcerated plaques and tight atheromatous stenosis . Neurologic complications occur in patients with an increased burden of plaque particles during CAS .\n\n【23】Emboli may also arise from platelet/fibrin thrombus formation at the angioplasty site. The thrombogenic exposed endothelium and stent initiates platelet ag-gregation and activation. Intra-proceduraljudicious advancement of a non traumatic appropriate small caliber guide wire ( Less than 0.018 inch) across the stenosis， short balloon inflation times， appropriate stent selection， performance of pre-deployment an-gioplasty and post stent deployment under-dilation are important technical factors that reduce the poten-tial for embolic risk . Appropriate pre and post procedural antiplatelet agents are factors that are also effective means of reducing embolic risks. Stenting in comparison to angioplasty alone may also further diminish the microembolic load . Various protection devices that include distal balloon protec-tion with aspiration and removable distal filters have been shown to reduce CAS related thromboembolic events ， however justification of their use remains controversial .\n\n【24】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【25】The value of intra-procedural protective devices in the context of delayed post-procedural embolism is limited. They are of value in preventing intra-proce-dural and immediate post procedure embolic events. Therefore， identification factors predisposing patients susceptible to such a risk and judicious selection of instrumentation across the vulnerable plaque dur-ing the procedure are important considerations in preventing this complication.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

She had diffuse adenomyosis in the posterior uterine wall and was admitted to our hospital at 12 weeks of gestation with persistent lower abdominal pain. She had started treatment with hydroxyprogesterone caproate to re-duce the focal inflammation of adenomyosis. At 28 weeks of gestation， she developed severe lower abdomi-nal pain， and ultrasonography revealed prolonged fetal heart rate deceleration. An emergency cesarean deliv-ery was performed， and a 907 g female infant with an Apgar score of 2/3 was delivered. Umbilical artery blood pH was 7.15. Bleeding from the veins surrounding an endometriotic lesion on the posterior wall of the uterus was observed， and SHiP was diagnosed.\n\n【4】Conclusions： Pregnancies complicated by endometriosis or adenomyosis require perinatal management， considering the possibility of SHiP complication. If acute abdominal pain and fetal heart rate deceleration occur during preg nancy， a search for intra-abdominal bleeding should be performed and emergent open hemostasis or cesare-an delivery should be considered.\n\n【5】Keywords： Endometriosis · Adenomyosis· Hemoperitoneum· Pregnancy Complications\n\n【6】Spontaneous hemoperitoneum in pregnancy (SHiP) is defined as nontraumatic， acute intra-abdominal bleeding during preg-nancy or the postpartum period， and it is a potentially life threatening pregnancy complication for mother and child . The perinatal mortality rate of SHiP is as high as 26.9%，and the complication requires prompt diagnosis and treatment . Endometriosis has been reported to be involved in the develop-ment of SHiP . We report the case of a 41-year-old wom-an with adenomyosis who developed hemoperitoneum due to endometriosis at 28 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】The patient was a 41-year-old woman (gravida 1， para 0) who had been diagnosed with diffuse adenomyosis on the poste-rior wall， which thickened to 5 cm in diameter， and her uter-us was above the navel . She desired to conceive， with an understanding of the risk of a pregnancy complicat-ed by adenomyosis. Eventually， the patient conceived via ar-tificial insemination. She was admitted at 12 weeks of gesta-tion because of persistent severe lower abdominal pain. Her body temperature on admission was 37.4C， white blood cell count (WBC) was 15 900/uL， and C-reactive protein (CRP) level was 8.99 mg/dL. There were no uterine contractions， and thecervical length was not shortened. Considering the possibility of intrauterine infection， antibiotics were administered； how-ever， the levels of inflammatory markers (WBC and CRP) did not appear to improve . Magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) at 13 weeks of gestation showed hemorrhagic changes in the posterior wall adenomyosis； however， there were no find-ings suggestive of an abscess . Antibiotics were dis-continued at 14 weeks of gestation because it was presumed that the lower abdominal pain and elevated inflammatory markers were caused by local inflammation of the adenomy-osis rather than by an infection. Hydroxyprogesterone capro-ate was administered because of its anti-inflammatory prop-erties. The abdominal pain and fever gradually resolved， and inflammatory markers gradually decreased. Ultrasonography showed that there was no remarkable change in the adenomy-osis lesion in the second trimester. The estimated fetal weight corresponded to gestational age.\n\n【9】At 28 weeks and 0 days of gestation， the patient sudden-ly had severe and persistent abdominal pain， which she had not previously experienced. Her blood pressure was 158/85mm Hg， heart rate 61 beat per min， and oxygen saturation99%. Immediate transabdominal ultrasonography revealed no findings suggestive of placental abruption or uterine rup-ture. A prolonged fetal heart rate deceleration was noted 17min after the onset of abdominal pain. With the diagnosis of fetal distress， an emergency cesarean delivery was performedunder general anesthesia. A 907-g female infant with an Apgar score of 2 at 1 min and 3 at 5 min and an umbilical artery blood pH of 7.15 was delivered and admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Blood pooled in the abdominal cavity， ex-tending from the vesicouterine pouch to the upper abdomen. Veins around endometrial lesions on the serosal surface of the uterine posterior wall were considered to be the cause of the intraperitoneal hemorrhage. Considering the possibility of bleeding from the tissue surrounding the uterus， no tissue samples were collected for histopathological analy-sis. Hemostasis was achieved through coagulation and com-pression. The total blood loss was 2020 g. After the cesare-an delivery， the patient's blood pressure was 140/86 mm Hgand heart rate was 55 beats per min. The hemoglobin level decreased to 7.7 g/dl， but no blood transfusion was required. Contrast-enhanced MRI performed on postoperative day 8showed extensive hemorrhagic infarction in the posterior wall of the adenomyosis . The postoperative course was uneventful， and the patient was discharged from the hospital15 days after surgery. Her menstruation resumed 1 month af-ter the delivery. She was treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist， followed by the insertion of a levonorg-estrel-releasing intrauterine system to prevent recurrence of severe dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia. The infant underwent ductus arteriosus closure at 33 days of age for patent ductus arteriosus. Additionally， the baby had a tracheostomy at 103days of age for subglottic stenosis. The baby was discharged at 132 days of age.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】SHiP is a relatively rare condition and is associated with seri-ous adverse pregnancy outcomes . The overall prevalence of SHiP in pregnancies complicated by endometriosis is esti-mated to be 0.4%， and endometriosis is considered a major risk factor for SHiP . In addition， maternal age over 35years has been reported as a risk factor for SHiP . In the present case， a 41-year-old woman with adenomyosis devel-oped SHiP due to peritoneal endometriosis at 28 weeks. The detailed mechanism by which endometriosis causes bleed-ing during pregnancy remains unknown； however， decidu-alization of ectopic endometrial stroma， vascular walls， and peritoneal endometriosis sites can be involved in the patho-genesis . It has been hypothesized that endometrial stro-mal cells invade blood vessels， narrowing the vessel lumen， and increase back pressure  or that the shedding of the en-dometrium causes adjacent vessels to rupture . The most common site of bleeding is the uterine wall， as was observed in our case， followed by the round ligament and adnexa . Patients with a history of abdominopelvic surgery have been reported to be at a higher risk of SHiP， suggesting that intra-abdominal inflammation or adhesions may be involved . In the present case， there were severe endometriotic adhe-sions in the pelvic cavity， which may have contributed to the development of SHiP.\n\n【12】Acute abdominal pain， flank pain， and fetal heart rate decel-eration may be present at the onset of SHiP and can lead toanemia and hypovolemic shock . However， these symptoms can be seen in placental abruption or uterine rupture； there-fore， it is difficult to suspect SHiP based on these symptoms alone . It is common to diagnose SHiP based on intraoper-ative findings . Ultrasonography has been reported to be useful in the diagnosis of SHiP . However， if there is only a small amount of bloody ascites and the uterus is enlarged， the diagnosis of SHiP on ultrasonography can be difficult. In this present case， blood that pooled in the vesicouterine pouch could not be detected by transabdominal ultrasonography. Puncturing the pouch of Douglas to check non-coagulable blood can be useful for the diagnosis of SHiP . Computed tomography or MRI should be considered for patients with sta-ble hemodynamics， as it allows for prompt diagnosis of SHiP and identification of the bleeding site . A limitation of our study is the lack of histopathological examination， because specimens were not sampled during surgery.\n\n【13】Perinatal and maternal mortality rates for SHiP have been re-ported to be 26.9% and 1.7%， respectively . In a review of54 cases of SHiP associated with endometriosis， 6% of cas-es required emergency hysterectomy， with a mean estimated blood loss of approximately 1957 mL . In the present case， the decision of cesarean delivery was decided 17 min after the onset of abdominal pain. Fetal cardiotocogram or blood test could not be performed because of the emergency situation. Timely management with surgical intervention is necessary， taking into consideration the hemodynamic status of the pa-tient and the gestational age of the fetus . Poor prognosis(fetal death，neonatal death， miscarriage， and umbilical artery blood < pH 7.1) was more common in cases with less than 32weeks of gestation， cases with a preoperative diagnosis of pla-cental abruption， and out-of-hospital cases  SHiP can occurat any time between 6 weeks of gestation and the postpartum period ， but it is most common during the third trimester of pregnancy . This can be due to decreased progesterone levels in the third trimester， which increase the expression ofinflammatory cells that promote peritoneal hemorrhage . If SHiP occurs in the second trimester， hemostasis alone and continued pregnancy can be options \n\n【14】It has been noted that pregnancies achieved via assisted re-productive technology and complicated with endometriosis can have a higher incidence and severity of SHiP than spon-taneous pregnancies complicated with endometriosis . According to a recent study， 0.3% of 362 pregnant women with endometriosis who conceived through assisted reproductive technology developed SHiP. It is hypothesized that the high hormonal levels associated with assisted reproductive tech-nology pregnancies exacerbate ectopic decidualization . Pregnant women with endometriosis， particularly those with deep peritoneal endometriotic lesions， who conceived using assisted reproductive technology may require careful man-agement for the development of SHiP . However， little ev-idence exists on indications for surgery to prevent the onset of SHiP， and accumulating cases are required to identify the risk factors for SHiP.\n\n【15】Uterine adenomyosis is a condition in which endometrial or endometrial-like cells invade the myometrium， causing uter-ine enlargement. The true prevalence of adenomyosis is un-known； however， the estimated prevalence has been reported to be 8.8% to 61.5%. The frequency of pregnancies com-plicated by adenomyosis is increasing owing to the increase in patient age of marriage and childbearing. However， there are few reports on the effect of adenomyosis on perinatal out-comes. Junctional zone thickening in adenomyosis is believed to cause placental hypoplasia， leading to late miscarriage， pre-term delivery， fetal growth restriction， and preeclampsia . Furthermore， prostaglandins， which are increased in patients with adenomyosis， promote uterine contractions and cervical canal dilatation and are considered a cause of preterm de-livery . Women with adenomyosis should be informed of pregnancy risk before conception； in addition， their treatment should be carefully managed during pregnancy.\n\n【16】Degeneration of adenomyosis is extremely rare. Symptoms of adenomyosis degeneration include fever， abdominal pain， and elevated levels of inflammatory markers . As these symp-toms can be observed in intrauterine infections， it is difficult to distinguish between the 2 conditions based on symptoms alone. MRI can show specific findings of adenomyosis degen-eration， which can help differentiate it from an infection . In our case， MRI at 13 weeks of gestation revealed a hemor-rhagic focus inside the adenomyosis. Within the adenomyo-sis， there were findings suggestive of hemorrhagic degener-ation； T1- and T2-weighted images showed hyperintens ity and heterogeneous hyperintensity with a hypointense rim， respectively.\n\n【17】Progesterone leads to decidualization and subsequent atrophic changes in the endometrium. Owing to their anti-inflammatoryproperties， progesterone agents are considered effective against endometriosis-and adenomyosis-associated pain . In the present case， hydroxyprogesterone caproate was adminis-tered to reduce focal inflammation in adenomyosis. It is un-clear whether hydroxyprogesterone caproate has an anti-in-flammatory effect on focal inflammation during pregnancy with adenomyosis； therefore， further research is required to determine this.\n\n【18】Conclusions\n\n【19】Pregnancies complicated by endometriosis or adenomyosis should be managed perinatally， considering the possibility of SHiP. If acute abdominal pain or fetal heart rate deceleration occurs during pregnancy， intraperitoneal bleeding should be investigated. If SHiP is suspected， open hemostasis or cesar-ean delivery should be considered.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

However， a clinical type with right-sided colitis sparing the anal side of the colon is also known. Mesalamine， which is generally used to treat UC， can rarely aggravate the disease.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 56-year-old woman with no history of colonic diseases visited our hospital because of a positive fecal occult blood test. The first colonoscopy showed inflamed and edematous mucosa extending from the ascending co-Ion to the right-half of the transverse colon. Colonic biopsy specimens demonstrated infiltrations of chronic in-flammatory cells in the mucosa and crypt abscesses， but no epithelioid granulomas， compatible with UC She was highly positive for PR3-ANCA， confirming the diagnosis of UC. After starting mesalamine， she had hyper-sensitivity reactions and aggravations of UC， which were confirmed endoscopically.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】Right-sided colitis may be a subgroup of UC， and this is the first report of this type of disease complicated by aggravation due to mesalamine hypersensitivity.\n\n【6】MeSH Keywords：\n\n【7】Antibodies， Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic·Colitis， Ulcerative ·Colon， Ascending• Drug Hypersensitivity· MesalamineUlcerative colitis (UC) is an idiopathic， chronic inflammato ry bowel disease in which the inflammation is mainly locat-ed in mucosal layers， affecting the bowel continuously from the rectum to the proximal side . The Montreal classifi-cation divides the extent of UC into 3 types： E1 (proctitis)， E2(left-sided；distal)，and E3 (pancolitis) . However， it has been known that some patients with proctitis or left-sided colitis have a cecal patch of inflammation ， and UC with right-sided or segmental colitis with no recto-sigmoid inflammation has been reported . Mesalamine and other 5-aminosali-cylic acid (5-ASA) compounds are mainstay drugs for induc-tion and maintenance treatment of UC because of their safety and usefulness . However， it is known that mesalamine-in-duced hypersensitivity reactions can occur and cause aggra-vation of UC . In this report， a case of UC that present-ed with right-sided colitis complicated by aggravation due to mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions is described. Moreover， changes in the endoscopic findings of mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions are also presented.\n\n【8】A 56-year-old woman with no history of UC visited our hospi-tal because of a positive fecal occult blood (FOB) test. She had felt vague discomfort in her upper abdomen for the past few years. However， she had no bloody mucoid diarrhea， abdom-inal pain， or fever. On examination， there were no abdominal findings except for mild tenderness of the right upper quad-rant. Routine laboratory tests were normal other than slight elevation of inflammatory markers， with the erythrocyte sedi-mentation rate (ESR) at 58 mm/h and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 0.47 mg/dL. The first colonoscopy showed that inflamed and edematous mucosa was confined from the ascending to the right-half of the transverse colon， with mucosal fria-bility， multiple shallow ulcerations， erosions， erythema， and loss of typical vascular patterns . Patchy inflamma-tion in other lesions or backwash ileitis was not seen. There were no significant bacteria on stool culture results. Colonic biopsy specimens of the inflamed mucosa demonstrated in-filtrations of chronic inflammatory cells in the lamina propria， cryptitis， crypt abscesses， and architectural distortions， but there were no epithelioid granulomas， which were patholog-ically compatible with UC . The rectum and left-sid-ed colon with intact colonoscopic findings did not show any inflammation on histological examination (data not shown).\n\n【9】Therefore， the right-sided colitis type of UC was diagnosed. The activity of UC was evaluated by the Mayo scoring system ， which resulted in a score of 3. Mesalamine (Asacoltablets； Tillotts Pharma AG， Ziefen， Switzerland) at 2400 mg/day was then started . However， approximately 1 week later， a slight fever occurred， and it increased to over 39℃ in an in-termittent manner. Exacerbation of the diarrhea and abdom-inal pain did not occur. She was admitted to our hospital 16days after the start of mesalamine treatment. Although phys-ical examination on admission only showed high fever and mild tenderness of the right upper quadrant， as at the first examination， no other abdominal symptoms or drug allergyfindings such as a skin rash could be seen. Blood examinations showed higher levels of inflammation markers， with the ESR at 119 mm/h and a CRP of 18.3 mg/dL Eosinophilia was not observed (4% of 5.73×10°/L white blood cells). However， liver and pancreatic enzyme levels were normal. With a normal lev-el of serum procalcitonin and negative results on blood culture and for cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigenemia， infections were ruled out. Although anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) and myelo-peroxidase anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA) were negative， proteinase-3 ANCA (PR3-ANCA) was positive(55.2U/mL， CLEIA method，SRLInc， Tokyo， Japan). Primary scle-rosing cholangitis (PSC) was not seen on magnetic resonancecholangiopancreatography (MRCP). On the basis of these re-sults， mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions were suspected. A lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) for mesa-lamine showed a positive result (220 cpm， 207%； control 106cpm). Therefore， the diagnosis was right-sided or segmental colitis type UC with mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity re-actions. Mesalamine treatment was immediately withdrawn， and a second colonoscopy was performed . It showed more intensely inflamed mucosa at the same inflamed co-lonic segments as at the first colonoscopy， from the ascend-ing colon to the right-half of the transverse colon， with more edematous mucosa， bowel stenosis， and much more purulent erosions and ulcerations. In addition， mucosal inflammation expanded toward the oral and anal sides. Scattered erosions appeared in the cecum and around the appendiceal orifice and in the left-half of the transverse colon. However， the left-sid-ed colon from the descending colon to the rectum showed no inflammation， as before. Histopathologic examination of bi-opsy specimens of the inflamed mucosa showed more severe inflammation (data not shown). After drug withdrawal， the high fever and inflammatory findings disappeared promptly. Only probiotics including Bifidobacterium longum and infan-tis were then prescribed. After discharge， the patient still felt vague discomfort of her right upper abdomen. Three monthsafter withdrawal of mesalamine treatment， a third colonos-copy was done as follow-up . It showed that the in-flamed mucosa was again restricted from the ascending colon to the right-half of the transverse colon， and the inflammation of the mucosa was ameliorated； the edematous mucosa and the bowel stenosis of the inflamed colonic segment were im-proved， the ulcerations of the ascending colon had improved and changed to multiple ulcer scars， and the purulent ero-sions and shallow ulcerations had improved. Scattered ero-sions at the cecum and the left-half of the transverse colon. appearing at the second colonoscopy， were no longer seen. The border between the inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa at the right-side of the transverse colon became clear because the edematous mucosa improved. After the third colonosco-py， oral prednisolone (PSL) was started at 30 mg/day along with 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) at 30 mg/day， in addition to the probiotics， and the dose of PSL was tapered over a peri-od of 1 year . A fourth colonoscopy was done after nearly 3 months of combination therapy with PSL and 6-MP. It showed that the edema of the inflamed mucosa from the ascending to the right-half of the transverse colon had improved even more and disappeared， resulting in mul-tiple reticular scars. The active erosions and ulcers were not seen， but instead， the regenerating epithelium was seen atthe same colonic segment. The border between the inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa at the right-side of the transverse colon could be seen more clearly. The inflammatory markers of UC were also improved， with ESR at 17 mm/h and CRP of0.03 mg/dL The patient has maintained her good general con-dition since she was discharged from the hospital.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】UC is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by involve-ment of the rectum with extension to the proximal colon in a continuous manner. On the other hand， involvement of the ap-pendiceal orifice as a discontinuous lesion is well known . In Japan's diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines in 2017， the right-sided or segmental type of UC is classified as one dis-ease type along with total， left-sided colitis， and proctitis. It is considered to be a subtype of UC in which the anal side is spared. So far， this subtype has been described in very few re-ports from Western countries . Although the cause of this discrepancy has not been well elucidated， the subgroup of pa-tients with an uncertain diagnosis has been classified as “in-determinate colitis\"； it accounts for about 5% of inflam-matory bowel disease (IBD) cases in Japan . The presentcase could be classified into this type of IBD because of the atypical location of the colonic lesion. However， while the co-lonic lesion was restricted to the right side of the colon， it was continuous. There were no lesions suggestive of Crohn’s dis-ease， such as longitudinal ulcers and a cobblestone appear-ance. Moreover， the histological lesions showed typical fea-tures of UC， without any granulomatous lesions. Given these findings， UC was diagnosed in this patient.\n\n【12】ANCAs are the most frequently studied serological markers for IBD .A combination of both tests could help make the diag-nosis of inflammatory bowel disease. The present case was neg-ative for MPO-ANCA， which constitutes a large part of P-ANCA， but was positive for PR3-ANCA， which targets the serine prote-ase proteinase-3 . Several studies reported that PR3-ANCA positivity was useful in differentiating UC from CD . In par-ticular， Arias-Loste et al. reported that a cut-off PR3-ANCA ti-ter of 11.8 chemiluminescent units showed 97.3% specificity for UC (it was 55.2 in the present case)， strongly supporting the diagnosis of UC in the present patient . Although PR3-ANCA is frequently detected in primary sclerosing cholangi-tis ， this disease was not detected with MRCP.\n\n【13】Our patient was diagnosed at a regular health screening with the FOB test. Howarth et al. investigated subjects who were found to be FOB-positive on screening for colorectal cancer. Among 44 838 cases， 52 were previously undetected UC， for an estimated rate of 116 per 100 000 (95%CI=85-147/105， and 17%(9/52) was asymptomatic. Among them， 52% (27/52) had only proctosigmoiditis， and 25%(13/52) had total colitis. However， the right-sided or segmental colitis type of UC was not found . On the other hand， among 236 000 healthy Japanese who underwent FOB test screening， 19 were diag-nosed as having asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic UC on colonoscopy， and 4 had asymptomatic right-sided or segmen-tal type . These studies suggested that UC， including right-sided or segmental colitis type， can exist in healthy individuals.\n\n【14】Another important aspect of this patient was aggravation of the colitis by hypersensitivity reactions to mesalamine. Although5-ASA agents like mesalamine are thought to be safe and are the first-line drugs for inducing remission and preventing UC ， hypersensitivity reactions such as fever and rash oc-cur in some patients . Although aggravation of UC with mesalamine has also been reported ， there havebeen very few reports of the changes in the endoscopic find-ings caused by hypersensitivity reactions. More edematous mucosa， much more purulent erosions， and ulcerations were seen. However， it is interesting that， despite some extensions of lesions to both oral and anal sides， the left-sided colon re-mained intact. Mesalamine-induced aggravation was diag nosed by the dramatic amelioration of symptoms after ces-sation of the drug， and the positive LTT result confirmed the diagnosis . To the best of our knowledge， this is the first report to show changes in the endoscopic findings during me-salamine-induced hypersensitivity reactions in a case of right-sided colitis type of UC.\n\n【15】Conclusions\n\n【16】We report a rare case of right-sided colitis with mesalamine-induced aggravation with unusual overlapping clinical features.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Melioidosis is a tropical infection that most commonly occurs in South East Asia， India and northern Australia . Because of the availability of long-distance travel， sporadic cases of meli-oidosis have been reported， including a case in a Swiss travel-er returning home after visiting Thailand， which is an endem-ic area for Burkholderia pseudomallei .\n\n【7】Melioidosis is an important opportunistic infection that can cause sepsis in adults with underlying conditions that impair immune function， such as diabetes， chronic renal failure， pro-longed steroid use， and alcoholism . Because Burkholderia pseudomallei is as soil saprophyte， agricultural workers may also be at risk from melioidosis . The published literature has re-ported a significant number of melioidosis cases in Malaysia .\n\n【8】We report a rare case of melioidosis that presented with cardi-ac tamponade and recurrent pericardial effusion complicated by constrictive pericarditis， in an immunocompetent individual.\n\n【9】Case Report\n\n【10】A 38-year-old native (Iban) East Malaysian man， who worked in a shipyard， complained of progressive shortness of breath， loss of weight， and loss of appetite for one month. He had no predisposing comorbidities，and there was no history of dia-betes mellitus， chronic renal failure， alcoholism， or malignancy.\n\n【11】On admission to the emergency department， he was tachypne-ic and tachycardic. His heart rate was 139 beats per minute， and his blood pressure was 100/70 mmHg. The jugular venous pressure was elevated， and the cardiac apex beat was dimin-ished on palpation. The lower lung fields were dull on percus-sion， with bilateral reduced vocal fremitus and vocal resonance.\n\n【12】Laboratory investigations showed a neutrophilic leukocytosis. Renal function tests， liver function tests， and fasting blood glu-cose levels were normal. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia， and low QRS voltage in the limb and chest leads. A chest radiograph showed cardiomegaly and bilater-al mild pleural effusions. The transthoracic echocardiogram(TTE) showed a large pericardial effusion resulting in cardiac tamponade . Echo-guided pericardiocentesis was performed urgently via an indwelling pigtail catheter， which drained approximately 1，000 ml of purulent pericardial flu-id. A repeat TTE showed minimal residual pericardial effusion and a 55% left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).\n\n【13】Laboratory investigations of the pericardial fluid showed an el-evated protein level， a white cell count of 80 per mm3 with 20%lymphocytes and 80% neutrophils. Pericardial fluid microscopy showed numerous pus cells and mononuclear cells， and cul-ture grew the Gram-negative aerobic organism， Burkholderia pseudomallei. The isolate was sensitive to imipenem， merope-nem，ceftazidime，and co-trimoxazole. The pericardial fluid was negative for Ziehl-Neelsen stain and Mycobacterial culture. Ultrasound of the abdomen showed a normal liver， spleen， and kidneys. Blood test for human immunodeficiency virus(HIV) antibody was negative.\n\n【14】The patient was treated with intravenous (IV) ceftazidime 2gm， six-hourly. However， after 17 days of I ceftazidime，echo-cardiography showed re-accumulation of the pericardial effu-sion. A second pericardiocentesis drained approximately 900ml of purulent pericardial fluid. Following the detection of re-current pericardial effusion， the infectious disease physician changed the antibiotics to Ⅳ meropenem 1gm，eight-hourly，in combination with oral Bactrim (trimethoprim/sulphamethox-azole 80/400 mg) twice daily. The patient’s general condi-tion improved gradually after the second pericardiocentesis and following the change of antibiotic regime. However， the chest radiograph after two weeks of antibiotics still showed bilateral moderate pleural effusions. Therefore， a third anti-biotic was added to the treatment regime， ciprofloxacin 500mg twice daily， and the dose of IV meropenem was increased to 2 gm three times daily. Following two weeks of triple anti-biotic therapy， the repeat chest radiograph showed minimal pleural effusions.\n\n【15】The patients was discharged from hospital after six weeks of in-hospital IV antibiotics treatment followed by one month of oral Bactrim (trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole 80/400 mg) twice daily， doxycycline 100 mg twice daily， and ciprofloxacin500 mg twice daily. Unfortunately， nine months later， the pa-tient was re-admitted to hospital with right heart failure. On this admission， TTE showed moderate， loculated pericardial effusion surrounded by pleural effusions. Paradoxical cardiac septal motion ('septal bounce') that was associated with res-piration was seen in the apical four-chamber view of the TTE.\n\n【16】A Doppler mitral inflow study showed a high trans-mitral inflow peak early filling (E-wave) and late diastolic filling (A wave) ve-locities， and an increased E to A ratio of 2 . Doppler tissue imaging showed preserved medial mitral annular E-wave velocity (peak E-wave： 16.4 cm/sec) and loss of A-wave veloci-ty . Respiratory variations of E-wave velocities were found with each cardiac cycle. In mitral inflow， E-wave velocity was decreased by >25% during inspiration ， where-as， in the tricuspid inflow view， the E-wave velocity was in-creased with inspiration . The inferior vena cava (IVC) was dilated with minimal respiratory variation.The estimatedpulmonary artery systolic pressure was 41 mmHg. Even though the pericardium， as viewed by TTE， was not calcified or thick-ened， the Doppler and tissue imaging hemodynamic findings were consistent with constrictive pericarditis.\n\n【17】Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax showed a thickened pericardium (8-10mm)， a loculated pericardial effusion， and a predominantly left pleural effusion . The clinical pre-sentation， echo-Doppler findings， and CT evidence of a thick-ened pericardium were consistent with constrictive pericarditis.\n\n【18】The patient was referred to a cardiothoracic surgeon and un-derwent a successful pericardiectomy. Histologic examination and culture of pericardial biopsy  showed multiple fragments of fibrous and fibrofatty tissue containing congest-ed small-sized to medium-sized blood vessels， mild-to-moder-ate neutrophil infiltrates， and some lymphocytes and plasma cells. There were no vasculitic changes， no micro-organisms， and no malignancy. The pleural biopsy  also showed areas of hemorrhage， increased fibrosis， and granulation tis-sue formation. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)， Gomori's methena-mine silver stain (GMS) and Ziehl-Neelson stains were nega-tive. These special investigations of the pericardial and pleural biopsies ruled out tuberculosis and fungal infection as the dif-ferential diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis. Following peri-cardiectomy， there was no evidence of relapse of melioidosis during the follow-up period of more than two years.\n\n【19】The clinical manifestations of melioidosis vary from benign lo-calized abscesses to severe pneumonia， to acute fulminating septicemia with multiple abscesses， often leading to death  Pericardial effusion is a rare presentation of melioidosis and has previously been reported in a series of case reports . Constrictive pericarditis is an uncommon post-inflammatory disorder characterized by a variably thickened， fibrotic， and fre-quently calcified， pericardium. Common causes of constrictive pericarditis include repeated episodes of acute pericarditis， pre-vious cardiac surgery， and radiation therapy .\n\n【20】In this case report， recurrent pericardial infection was the most plausible explanation for the development of constric-tive pericarditis. However， there is limited data regardingconstrictive pericarditis secondary to melioidosis. A previous-ly published case of melioidosis pericarditis reported imaging findings and hemodynamic confirmation of constrictive peri-carditis . However， the clinical outcome of the patient in this previous case report was unknown， and there was no in-formation on the pericardial histology， which is an important diagnostic test， particularly in differentiating between tuber-culosis and melioidosis .\n\n【21】Because melioidosis is a great mimic of other disease process-es， it may pose a diagnostic challenge if clinicians lack aware-ness of this infection， or have a low clinical index of suspicion. A sensitive and specific serological test can support a diag-nosis of melioidosis. However， isolation of Burkholderia pseu-domallei from the patient tissue or fluids remains the 'gold standard' for the diagnosis of melioidosis . In areas where both tuberculosis and melioidosis are prevalent， clinicians will consider tuberculous pericarditis in the differential diagnosis.\n\n【22】Chetchotisakd et al. found that the major diagnostic method to distinguish between melioidosis pericarditis and tubercu-lous pericarditis was pericardial fluid culture， but pericardial histology was found to be most useful when diagnosing tu-berculosis . The patient lived in an area where tuberculosis and melioidosis were endemic. Therefore， pericardiocentesis for culture and pericardial biopsy are important to differenti-ate between melioidosis and tuberculous pericarditis because the treatments of two diseases are different. Also， melioidosis should be ruled out in patients with suspected tuberculosis while instituting presumptive anti-tuberculosis treatment in areas where both diseases are prevalent . Non-septicemic melioidosis presenting as cardiac tamponade carries a mortal-ity of between 20-60%. Early detection， pericardiocentesis， and appropriate antibiotics significantly reduce the morbidi-ty and mortality of pericardial melioidosis. However， recur-rent melioidosis can occur despite the primary episode being non-bacteremic and despite adherence to appropriate antibi-otic regimes \n\n【23】In this case report， the patient survived because of early in-tervention and intensive treatment. In the era of modern im-aging， the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis continues to be a clinical challenge. Other pericardial diseases， such as he-mopericardium or pericardial cyst ， right heart failure due to severe tricuspid regurgitation ， or any pathological con-dition that can cause a restrictive effect on the heart， may mimic constrictive pericarditis. The distinction between con-strictive pericarditis and other causes of heart failure， such as restrictive cardiomyopathy， is important because pericardiec-tomy can be an effective treatment for constrictive pericar-ditis. Preserved medial mitral annular early filling， or E-wave velocity， by Doppler imaging is observed in constrictive peri-carditis， which is an important point of distinction from re-strictive physiology . Notably， the imaging findings of con-strictive pericarditis were confirmed by the surgical findings in this case. The patient's symptoms and functional status improved significantly after successful pericardiectomy. The patient worked in a shipyard， which means that exposure to muddy or stagnant water could have been the source of infec-tion. Following hospital discharge， the patient was advised to avoid contact with contaminated soil or water and to use in-fection prevention precautions in future， including the wear-ing of a mask， gloves， boots， and a gown， whenever possible， to minimize the risk of infection exposure at work. This case highlighted the importance of serial echocardiography in the diagnostic evaluation during the clinical course of melioidosis pericarditis and the advantage of multimodality cardiovascular imaging in clinical practice. Due to the lack of clinical research on this rare complication of melioidosis， it was not possible to determine the optimal timing for follow-up clinical re-evalua-tion. However， based on the clinical course of the patient， as shown in Figure 3， following the onset of melioidosis pericar-ditis， monthly clinical follow-up of between six months and 12months including echocardiography would be advised.\n\n【24】Constrictive pericarditis is a debilitating and potentially fa tal complication of melioidosis pericarditis. Early detection of constrictive pericarditis is important because the complica-tion is curable by pericardiectomy. Use of multimodality car-diovascular imaging is valuable to distinguish between con-strictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy. From the findings in this case， the authors recommend that， following the onset of pericarditis due to melioidosis， monthly clinical follow-up of between six months and 12 months including echocardiography is advised to detect potential complication of constrictive pericarditis", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The present study is aimed to evaluate the expression of CD44 by immunohistochemistry in prostatic core biopsies and transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) specimens in prostatic lesions. METHODS： A total of 63 prostatic samples were enrolled in the study， which included cases of benign prostatic hyperplasia， prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostatic adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical expression of CD44 was studied to assess its association with histopathological findings and clinical data in the aforementioned samples. RESULTS： CD44 expression was strongly expressed in inflammatory and non-neoplastic cells as compared to neoplastic cells. Within the later， intensity of CD44expression was stronger in well-differentiated than in poorly differentiated tumors.Loss of CD44 expression was associated with greater tumor aggressiveness. The positive expression of CD44 expression on immunohistochemistry was strongly associated with lower S. PSA levels， Gleason’s scores & grades. Consequently， the sensitivity， specificity， positive predictive value， negative predictive value and accuracy of negative CD44 expression for the diagnosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma were 93.3%，79.3%，82.4%，92% and 86.4%， respectively. CONCLUSION： There is a great requirement for markers that distinguish slowly progressive from rapidly progressive prostate cancers in paraffin-embedded tissues. CD44 promotes the maintenance of tissue integrity， and its expression in prostate cancer is associated with reduced tumor aggressiveness. The up-regulation of the expression of CD44 by certain microRNAs can be utilized as a novel therapeutic agent against prostatic adenocarcinoma.\n\n【1】Introduction\n\n【2】Prostate cancer has become a major public health problem in the industrialized world during the last decades of the 20th century. In 2013， prostate cancer in the United States accounted for 25%\nof cancers in men with a 1 in the 6-lifetime risk of a prostatic cancer diagnosis. Earlier， it was thought that the prevalence of prostate cancer in India is far lower than in Western countries. However， with the increased rate of migration of rural popu-lation to urban areas， lifestyle changes， increasing awareness， and easy availability to medical facilities， an increasing number of prostatic carcinoma cases are being diagnosed. Tumor cells express a wide variety of adhesion molecules， amongst which is CD44， a transmembrane glycoprotein that exists in many forms， with CD44H being a predominant form . Studies of CD44 ex-pression in prostatic core biopsies have shown conflicting results.\n\n【3】Lokehshwar BL and colleagues studied the expression of CD44via immunohistochemistry in high-grade prostate cancer andconcluded that normal prostate epithelial cells expressed none to low levels of CD44. Nicole S Vernaik and colleagues explored the role of CD44 in prostate cancer and concluded that CD44 acts as a tumor suppressor gene in carcinoma prostate and its role is downregulated by DNA methylation. Carlos Gustavo Hirth and colleagues evaluated the expression of pan CD44in69 patients with prostatic adenocarcinoma. They concluded that CD44 negativity was correlated with higher Gleason's scores and higher preoperative S. PSA levels.\n\n【4】Methods\n\n【5】The present study was designed and carried out in the Depart-ment of Pathology， collaborating with the Department of Urol-ogy，King George’s Medical University， Lucknow，U.P， India.\n\n【6】The prospective study was carried out for one year  and included 63 cases. The cases included benign pro-static hyperplasia (29 cases)， prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia(4 cases) and prostatic adenocarcinoma (30cases).\n\n【7】The formalin preserved specimens were collected in a histopathology lab， King George's Medical University， Lucknow. Proper grossing of theses specimen was done following the standard protocols culminating in the preparation of paraffin blocks. The blocks prepared were sectioned two times， one for a hematoxylin and eosin section and the second time for CD44expression， which was studied via immunohistochemistry.\n\n【8】The age of the patients ranged from 40-87 years， with a mean of 68.30+11.30 years. Histopathologically， maximum cases (n=30，47.6%) were diagnosed as adenocarcinoma， followed by benign prostatic hyperplasia (n=29， 46%) and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia(n=4， 6.3%) respectively.\n\n【9】The prechemotherapy as well as the post chemotherapeu-tic S. PSA levels were noted along with Gleason's grade. The patients were also evaluated for biochemical recurrence (posi-tive=6 monthly S. PSA levels>0.4ng/ml). Anti-CD44 antibody\\[ERP1013Y\\] ab 51037 was used in the study with human reactiv-ity. The positive tissue controls were human breast carcinoma tissue and human urinary bladder.\n\n【10】The statistical analysis was done using SPSS (Statistical pack-age for social science) Version 21.0 statistical analysis software. The values were represented in number (%) and Mean+-SD.A value of <0.05 was considered significant.\n\n【11】Observations and Results\n\n【12】This study evaluated the expression of CD44 in different pro-static lesions. Maximum patients in our study were in their5th-6th decade. There were 63 cases where 30 were of prostatic adenocarcinoma， 29 of benign prostatic hyperplasia and 4 of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia； all diagnosed and confirmedhistopathologically. CD44 expression was positive in 25 cases， negative in 34 cases and inconclusive in 4 cases. In adenocarci-noma cases， 2(8%) of 30 cases were positive for CD44， and 28cases (82.4%) were negative. In Benign prostatic hyperplasia，22(88%) out of 25 were positive for CD44， and 3 (8.8%) out of 25were negative. In Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia，1(4%) out of 4 was positive for CD44 expression. The expression of CD44was membranous and graded as positive or negative， taking two variables into count. First was the proportion of cells graded as 0(0-5%)，1 (6-24%)，2(26-75%) and 3 (76-100%). Second was intensity with 0 (absent)， 1 (weak at 400x)， 2 (intermediate at100x) and 3 (strong at 40x)8. A total score of 0-3 was considered negative， and 4-6 was considered positive .\n\n【13】It was seen that CD44 positive expression was seen in the younger age group and associated with lower S. PSA levels with a significant p value<0.001. Amongst the CD44 expression， posi-tive cases majority had histologically diagnosed benign prostatic hyperplasia， compared with CD44 negative cases. The p-value calculated was significant.\n\n【14】The sensitivity of CD44 negative expression for the diagnosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma was 93.3%， with a specificity of79.3% and accuracy of 86.4%. In CD44 positive cases， no bio-chemical recurrence was noticed (6 monthly) S. PSA<0.04ng/ml， however in CD44 negative cases， 44.4% of cases showed bio-chemical recurrence. However， the p-value calculated was not significant (p value=0.3). Hence no significant association could be accessed between biochemical recurrence and CD44 expres-sion . CD44 showed a membranous staining pattern with lymphocytes， macrophages， fibroblasts and epithelial cells acting as a positive internal control.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】The study included 63 patients with prostatic lesions； 29 patients were diagnosed as benign prostatic hyperplasia， 4 with prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and 30 with prostatic adenocarcinoma histologically. The study included patients from January 2017to January 2018. The patients were followed up for 6 months to evaluate S. PSA levels for the determination of biochemical recurrence.\n\n【17】CD44 acts as a metastatic tumor suppressor gene for prostate cancer. Its expression at mRNA and protein level is down-regulated during prostatic cancer progression， with downreg ulation correlating with high tumor grade， aneuploidy and tumor metastasis. The human chromosome 11p13 harbours the metastatic tumor suppressor gene. Studies have shown that cytosine methylation in the promoter region of CD44expression leads to decreased CD44 expression in the human prostate 13， 14，15.\n\n【18】The CD44 expression in this study was compared to differ-ent variables like S. PSA levels (both preoperatively and at six-monthly interval post-chemotherapy)， Gleason’s score， age and biochemical recurrence. It was seen that the mean age of those with CD44 expression was significantly lower (65+11.15years) as compared to those with CD44 negative expression(71.59+10.57years).\n\n【19】Similarly， the proportion of those with S. PSA levels >8ng/ml was significantly lower (20%) in CD44 positive cases as com-pared to those with CD44 negative expression (94.1%)(P value<0.001).\n\n【20】Amongst those with CD44 expression， a significantly higher proportion of cases were BPH (88%) as compared to those with CD44 negative expression (8.8%)(p value<0.001). The study alsoshowed no significant correlation between CD44 with biochem-ical recurrence； however， this correlation should be compared with other studies involving a large sample size and longer follow up period.\n\n| SN  | Variable  | CD44 Positive(n=25)  | CD44 Negative(n=34)  | Statisticalsignificance  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1.  | Mean Age±SD  | 65.00±11.15  | 71.59±10.57  | t'=2.311；p=0.024  |\n| 2.  | S.PSA <4ng/ml 4-8 ng/ml \\>8 ng/ml  | 9(36.0%)11(44.0%) 5(20.0%)  | 1(2.9%)1(2.9%)32(94.1%)  | x2=33.85：p<0.001  |\n| 2.  | Mean S.

Consequently， the sensi-tivity， specificity， positive predictive value， negative predictive value and accuracy of negative CD44 expression for adenocar-cinoma detection were 93.3%，79.3%，82.4%， 92% and 86.4%， respectively.\n\n【24】Conclusion\n\n【25】To conclude， the expression of CD44 by immunohistochemistry may help detect prostatic adenocarcinoma.CD44 expression is seen in normal prostatic tissue and benign conditions like be-nign prostatic hyperplasia， and a negative expression is seen in patients with prostatic adenocarcinoma. However， in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and initial grades of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma， focal expression of CD44 is seen， which is lost as the grade worsens. CD44 positivity is associated with lower serum PSA levels and low Gleason's grades. Hence up-regulation of CD44 expression by certain microRNAs can be utilized as a novel therapeutic agent against prostatic adenocar-cinoma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It is crucial to be aware of these atyp-ical presentations of COVID-19 so that patients are appropriately identified， isolated， and treated， while pro-tecting health care workers from exposure.\n\n【6】MeSH Keywords： Chest Pain · Coronavirus·COVID-19·Pleural Diseases ·Pleurisy\n\n【7】The world is currently in the midst of the Coronavirus Disease2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2， the virus responsible for COVID-19， has infect-ed more than 8 million people worldwide and placed massive strains on healthcare systems around the world. This disease is still in its early stages internationally and there is much we still do not know about the virus. Although classically causing fever， cough， and shortness of breath， more and more evidence sug-gests that the manifestations of COVID-19 can be much more subtle or masquerade as other clinical entities. In addition to the classic respiratory symptoms， it is now becoming clear that gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and diarrhea， the loss of smell and taste， and thromboembolic events，among others， can be the main presentation of COVID-19 . It is crucial for clinicians to be aware of these atypical presentations so that these patients are appropriately identified， isolated， and treated， while properly protecting health care workers from exposure. This article adds to this developing literature by reporting the first case of viral pleurisy associated with COVID-19.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 48-year-old white man presented to the Emergency Department with acute-onset pleuritic chest pain. He had a medical profile notable for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus， with a recent hemoglobin A1c of 7.8%. His home med-ications included perindopril 8 mg daily， metformin 500 mg twice daily， and empagliflozin 25 mg daily， and there had been no changes to his regimen in recent months. He was an ac-countant and his only sick contact was a colleague who had returned from international travel with mild upper respira tory tract symptoms， whom the patient was exposed to sev-eral days earlier.\n\n【10】The patient was well up until the evening before presentation， when he developed acute left-sided pleuritic chest pain while at work， and he returned home， where he tried to get some rest. The next day， the patient's pain worsened and he devel-oped a dry cough and shortness of breath， at which point he presented to the Emergency Department to be assessed. Given his cough， the patient was immediately masked and placed on isolation and had a nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19 and a viral respiratory panel performed. His chest pain was described as 5/10 in intensity， and “sharp\"and“stabbing” in character； it was worse with deep inspiration and was predominantly on the left， but also present on the right. The patient denied any diaphoresis or any radiation of his pain. His pain did not change with position when lying flat or leaning forwards. He had no history of immobility or long-distance travel and had not tried any medications at home for relief of his pain.\n\n【11】The patient appeared uncomfortable but in no distress. Vital signs demonstrated a temperature of 37.3℃， a heartrate of110 beats per minute， a blood pressure of 155/92 that was equal bilaterally， a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute， and an oxygen saturation of 85% on room air that improved to 95% with 2 L/min of supplemental oxygen. A physical ex-amination revealed a normal cardiac examination with a nor-mal first and second heart sound， no murmurs or rubs， and a jugular venous pressure of 2 cm above the sternal angle. A re-spiratory examination revealed fine crackles to both bases bi-laterally with poor inspiratory effort secondary to pain， but no wheeze. There was no tenderness to palpation over his chest wall. An abdominal examination was normal， with a soft and non-tender abdomen to all quadrants， with no organomegaly or costovertebral angle tenderness. He had no asymmetry or tenderness to his legs or calves and no peripheral edema.\n\n【12】Blood tests were notable for a mildly elevated white blood cell count of 12.9x10°/L and an arterial blood gas revealing a partial pressure of oxygen of 56 mmHg， a pH of 7.35， a par-tial pressure of carbon dioxide of 41 mmHg， and a serum bi-carbonate of 23 mmol/L His coagulation studies，electrolytes， renal function， liver function， troponin， and creatinine kinase levels were within normal limits. His urinalysis did not show any abnormalities.\n\n【13】An electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with no atypical features. An initial 2-view chest x-ray was nor-mal. The patient was sent for a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan with pulmonary embolism (PE) protocol， which was technically adequate and was negative for PE. The CT scan was unremarkable aside from some bibasilar atelectasis and subsegmental atelectasis involving the lower lobes and did not demonstrate any evidence of ground-glass opacities.\n\n【14】The patient's tachycardia had dropped to the 90's with fluid re-suscitation but he remained on 2 L/min of supplemental oxygen and was subsequently admitted under the internal medicine service for further workup of his pleuritic chest pain with hy-poxemia without clear etiology. Echocardiography demonstrat-ed normal biventricular size and function， no significant valvular abnormalities， and no pericardial effusion. A D-dimer returned elevated at 1.65 mg/L and， due to a high suspicion of possible PE， the patient underwent a nuclear medicine ventilation/per-fusion (V/Q) scan， which was also negative. He was ultimate-ly diagnosed with viral pleuritis as the diagnosis of exclusion.\n\n【15】The patient's pain was managed with acetaminophen and ibu-profen， which successfully reduced his pain. The following day， he developed a fever of 38.6℃ and tachycardia of 120 beats per minute， at which point he had blood cultures drawn and was started on a loading dose of 500 mg of azithromycin in-travenously (IV) followed by 250 mg lV q24h and ceftriaxone1000 mg V q24h for a presumed early community-acquired pneumonia. His COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab ultimately re-turned positive and Covid-19 was then thought to be respon-sible for his viral pleuritis. The diagnosis was made using the Cobas SARS-CoV-2 test on the Cobas8800 system.Over the following 3 days， his shortness of breath and work of breath-ing worsened and his oxygen requirements increased from2 L/min to a peak of 4 L/min. A repeat chest x-ray demon-strated mild bilateral lower-lobe opacities. A repeat ECG was unchanged and lab tests did not reveal any noteworthy ab-normalities. Over the next 3 days， his chest pain completely resolved， oxygen requirements were weaned back to room air， antibiotics were discontinued after 5 days of therapy， and finalized blood cultures returned negative. The patient never received any COVID-19-specific treatment. After admission for7 days， he was discharged home in stable condition and has since recovered after following up with his family physician.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】I report a patient who experienced pleuritic chest pain as the initial manifestation of infection with COVID-19， who subse-quently developed more typical features， including cough， fever， shortness of breath， and hypoxia. After extensive workup for common causes of his pleuritic chest pain ， I believe the most likely cause for this patient's presentation was viral pleuritis caused by COVID-19.\n\n【18】Although myopericarditis has been associated with COVID-19， this patient did not have pericardial features such as the typ-ical positional changes in relation to his pain， a friction rub， or a pericardial effusion， and never developed any suggestive ECG features throughout his admission . He also did not develop a rise in his troponin or creatinine kinase to suggest myocardial involvement. Pulmonary embolism was extensively ruled out with a negative CT scan with PE protocol and a V/Q scan. His normal ECG and lack of elevated cardiac biomarkers ruled out an acute coronary syndrome. Imaging modalities did not support the diagnosis of any pleural effusion， hemothorax， pneumothorax， empyema， pulmonary abscess， malignancy， or liver/splenic abscess that were partially imaged with the pa-tient's CT scan， which may have explained his pain. The patient was white， effectively ruling out sickle cell disease. Although it is possible that this patient had a rheumatologic cause for pleurisy， he had no personal or family history of any rheuma-tologic symptoms， and this was thought to be exceptionally unlikely considering a positive COVID-19 swab， and further in-vestigations were not pursued.\n\n【19】While in the Emergency Department， he was very worried about possibly having COVID-19 given the exposure to his colleague who had recently travelled， but was reassured by the medicalteam that this was exceptionally unlikely given his largely nor-mal CT scan. Although most patients with COVID-19 have find-ings of ground-glass opacities on CT scan， which can be help-ful to aid in diagnosis， is important to realize that this may not be a highly sensitive finding， especially early in the disease course . A recent study of 1099 patients with COVID-19 by Guan et al. demonstrates that no radiographic or CT abnormal-ity was identified in 17.9% of those who had non-severe dis-ease at the time of admission to hospital and in 2.9% of those with severe disease . If a patient is presenting with features concerning for COVID-19， clinicians should still exercise a high degree of suspicion even if the patient has normal imaging studies. Luckily， this patient had developed a dry cough by the time he presented to the Emergency Department， otherwise he may not have been isolated as quickly and may possibly have exposed health care workers to the virus.\n\n|  | ·Pulmonary abscess  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Infectious  | ·Liver/splenic abscess  |\n| Infectious  | ·Empyema  |\n|  | ·Viral pleuritis  |\n|  | ·Pericarditis  |\n| Cardiac  | ·Myocarditis  |\n| Cardiac  | ·Acute coronary syndrome  |\n|  | ·Pulmonary embolism  |\n| Respiratory  | ·Pleural effusion  |\n| Respiratory  | ·Pneumothorax  |\n|  | ·Hemothorax  |\n| Inflammatory  | ·Lupus pleuritis  |\n| Inflammatory  | ·Rheumatoid pleuritis  |\n| Hematologic/Oncologic  | ·Malignancy  |\n| Hematologic/Oncologic  | ·Sickle cell crisis  |\n\n【21】Conclusions\n\n【22】To the best of my knowledge， this is the first reported case of COVID-19-associated viral pleurisy in the literature. Additionally， this patient's pleurisy was his initial presenting symptom， which developed prior to the onset of his cough， fever， and short-ness of breath.Although cough， fever， and shortness of breath appear to be the most common manifestations of COVID-19， this disease is demonstrating that it has atypical presentations such as the pleurisy described here. Given that COVID-19 can masquerade as other clinical entities， clinicians must contin-ue to exercise a high degree of suspicion when assessing un-differentiated patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

A cesarean section under general anesthesia was performed in a cardiac surgery operating theatre， and a healthy male infant was delivered. Afterwards， standard HF pharma-cotherapy and bromocriptine were introduced. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance confirmed nonischemic cardiomyopathy with severe impairment of the left and right ventricle (RV) func-tion with a RVEF of 22% . In the eighth week of treatment， the patient's condition improved. The patient was discharged in the tenth week with an LVEF of 32%. However， in the fourth month， the patient presented with postpartum thyroiditis. Due to an increasing number of VT episodes， the patient required radio-frequency ablation treatment. The bro-mocriptine was continued for almost 12 months due to an in-creasing level of serum prolactin (503 mlU/l) after a temporary discontinuation of treatment . At 12-month follow-up， LVEF improved up to 54%， but the LV longitudinal systolic function remained at a depressed level and significant mitral insufficiency persisted .\n\n【13】The patient was referred for clinical genetic testing. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) in the proband was performed using the TrueSight One (TSO， Illumina， San Diego， California， United States) sequencing panel. A novel frameshift insertion NM\\_001267550： p.Leu23499fs/c.70497\\_40498insT of TTN gene was identified in the proband and in the proband's asymptom-atic 50-year-old mother but not in her younger sister . The patient's father had died at the age of 40 in an accident.\n\n【14】This case shows that PPCM is a complex， multifaceted phe-nomenon. PPCM is associated with a high mortality rate， which varies from 1.36% (in-hospital mortality) to 30% (over a 47-month observation) .\n\n【15】Traditional risk factors for PPCM include： multiparity， pre-ec-lampsia， advanced or early maternal age (>30 or <18 years)， prolonged use of p-agonists， family history， ethnicity， smoking， diabetes， hypertension， and previous incidence of PPCM .\n\n【16】Mutations in the TTN gene have been reported as pathogenic in women with PPCM and a family history of DCM . However， as far as we are aware， the frameshift mutation identified in our patients has not been described before . Mutations in the TTN gene lead to the functional change of titin and de-creased passive force compared to controls .\n\n【17】In this case， the proband's mother is an obligate carrier. However， the proband's father’s premature death and lack of contact with the patient's distant relatives precluded a full as-sessment of a family history of DCM. The patient had no tra-ditional risk factors， which indicates that the identified TTN truncating variant was a major contributing factor to the de-velopment of PPCM.\n\n【18】The rate of recovery from PPCM is particularly low in the case of LVEF <30% and LVEDd >60 mm . The period of 3-6months should be considered as a minimum time to recov-ery， yet cases of very late (>12 months up to 5 years) recover-ies have been reported .\n\n【19】The condition of our patient with severe LV insufficiency im-proved during optimal standard HF therapy combined with bromocriptine. However， her LVEF only exceeded 50% at 12months after delivery.\n\n【20】This result is contrary to the reported very low recovery rate of PPCM cases with a family history of DCM and underlying muta-tions . However， in our patient’s family， only her mother has the TTN truncating variant identified， with no established pene-trance so far. This case is consistent with recent results indicat-ing no differences in recovery rate or major cardiac event rate between DCM patients with and without TTN truncation . Moreover， the incomplete disease penetrance (62-82%) was more pronounced in women compared to men . This pat-tern suggests that while TTN mutations predispose to cardio-myopathy， there are other additional biological， genetic， or en-vironmental risk factors that may influence the course of the disease， especially in women .\n\n【21】In our case， one of these factors may be a high prolactin lev-el. Bromocriptine， which decreases the synthesis of prolactin and consequently its 16-kDa fragment of proven cardiotoxic and vascular impairing effects， was reported to have a benefi-cial effect in PPCM treatment . Although longer-term treat-ment with bromocriptine appears to have been effective in the case of our patient， the efficacy of such treatment in gen-eral remains to be proven.\n\n【22】A ventricular arrhythmia may be a second factor causing heart muscle damage and consequent penetrance of TTN muta tions. Patients with an LVEF <30% are at the highest risk of life-threatening arrhythmias， but LV impairment in PPCM may be reversible .\n\n【23】Our patient had severe heart failure for 7 weeks， and she might have been considered as a candidate for ICD implan-tation. However， according to guidelines， the decision about the implantation of ICD should be made after 4-6 months of optimal medical therapy . If available， a wearable cardiac defibrillator (WCD)， a device capable of analyzing the electric activity of the heart and generating an electric impulse when necessary， should be considered in PPCM patients with LVEF under 35% for 6 months .\n\n【24】Postpartum thyroiditis， which is an autoimmune disorder， may be another factor influencing cardiac function . Moreover， the autoimmune reaction could have acted as an addition-al pathophysiological factor of PPCM in the case of this pa-tient . Additionally， our case shows that the number of the additional pathophysiological factors may be important for the penetrance of the TTN mutation， as our patient's mother has stayed asymptomatic to date.\n\n【25】Conclusions\n\n【26】Truncating mutations of the TTN gene may be pathogenic in PPCM cases， especially in patients with no traditional risk fac-tors of PPCM. Despite the genetic burden， recovery from this cardiomyopathy is possible. Multidisciplinary care is crucial for satisfactory outcome of patients with severe PPCM； pro-longed treatment with bromocriptine， guided by serum pro-lactin levels， is particularly beneficial. Strict ambulatory mon-itoring is very important due to the risk of developing other cardiac and extracardiac conditions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

If colon cancer is suspected during pregnancy， the diag. nosis is a therapeutic challenge that should be managed by a multidisciplinary team of specialists. Standardized therapeutic models do not exist. In this article we present a case of a pregnant patient with stenotic sigmoid colon adenocarcinoma. We describe the interdisciplinary treatment and the 2-step surgical approach used dur-ing pregnancy.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 32-year-old women in week 28.8 of pregnancy was admitted to the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics， meeting the standard pregnancy criteria of constipation. After a week of unsuccessful conservative treatment， the patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)， which disclosed a stenosed segment in the sigmoid colon. After an emergency colonoscopy with biopsy sampling. histological analysis confirmed sigmoid adeno-carcinoma. In a multidisciplinary consultation of specialists， in which neonatological and oncological aspects were considered， a 2-step surgical plan was established. In the first step (gestational week 29.8)， a loop trans-verse colostomy with intestinal decompression was performed. In the second step (gestational week 32.8)， an elective primary caesarean section followed by open oncological sigmoid resection was performed. No postop-erative complications occurred in either step. The neonate was healthy and had a birth weight appropriate for the gestational age.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】In cases of colorectal cancer during pregnancy， staged surgical approaches should be considered to reduce ma-ternal and fetal morbidity.\n\n【6】Keywords： Colorectal Surgery · Pregnancy， Abdominal·Colorectal Neoplasms · Intestinal ObstructionThe problems that occur in cases of colorectal cancer during pregnancy are 3-fold. First， common pregnancy symptoms aggra-vate the immediate cancer diagnosis. Second， in addition to the mother's genesis， the primary concern of treatment outcomes should be the child's survival. Third， conventional management options are limited during pregnancy in these types of settings.\n\n【7】In Western countries， colorectal cancer is often detected in old-er patients during colorectal cancer screenings. However， at a young age， diagnosis is likely to be delayed owing to common presenting symptoms and the physician's lack of awareness of the possibility of this entity. Moreover， in pregnancy， the differ-entiation between common pregnancy signs and cancer symp-toms is a major diagnostic challenge for obstetricians . If colorectal cancer is suspected during pregnancy， the common symptoms， such as obstruction， meteorism， and abdominal pain， should be identified， and a differential diagnosis of pregnancy obstruction considered. Thus， the diagnosis of colorectal can-cer during pregnancy represents a therapeutic challenge that should be managed by a multidisciplinary team of specialists.\n\n【8】The second key issue in colorectal cancer during pregnancy is the safety of the fetus， avoiding the risk of fetal damage or abortion. The genesis of the mother and the survival of the fetus must be in focus when considering treatment modali-ties and anticipatory outcomes.\n\n【9】Unfortunately， in those cases， the treatment options are lim-ited. Owing to scarce data availability， no standardized thera-peutic models exist and only a few case studies have reported a small number of cases and treatment options. The imple mentation of the adequate therapy is based on different fac-tors. Depending on the type of cancer， chemotherapy can be necessary. In addition， if surgery is urgently needed， the fetus and the tumor must be considered in order to establish the appropriate surgical treatment . Robotic surgical manage-ment can also be performed successfully if the tumor is pri-mary and resectable . We present a novel approach to treat colon cancer with bowel obstruction during pregnancy using a2-stage surgical approach and reference the available literature.\n\n【10】Case Report\n\n【11】A 32-year-old woman (gravida III para ll) with no family his-tory of cancer was admitted to our Emergency Department at28.8 weeks of pregnancy reporting symptoms of nausea， vom-iting， and constipation for the past 4 days. The clinical exam-ination revealed a distended abdomen with no pain and con-siderable meteorism. The general physical examination showed no abnormalities. All laboratory values were within the refer-ence range. The patient was admitted to the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics because pregnancy-related obstipa-tion was suspected. After the patient received a week of con-servative medical treatment， we conducted further investiga-tions because of her persistent constipation and abdominal distention. Owing to acute fetal deterioration and threatened prematurity， lung maturation was induced with betametha-sone at gestational week 29.4. Owing to the progression of il-eus symptoms， ineffective symptomatic therapy， and detection of a distended large intestine by sonography， we performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)， which showed a massive-ly distended large intestine with a stenotic process in the sig-moid colon . We performed an emergency recto-sig-moidoscopy and detected a stenotic cancerous structure in the sigmoid colon 20 cm from the anus . The histologi-cal results of the biopsy confirmed sigmoid adenocarcinoma.\n\n【12】A multidisciplinary team of specialists， consisting of obstetri-cians， neonatologists， colorectal surgeons， and oncologists， was consulted. The team considered the neonatological aspects，in-cluding a high risk of premature complications， such as cerebral hemorrhage， pulmonary hypoplasia， and necrotizing enterocolitis，and the high comorbidity of an oncological resection of the sig-moid colon cancer in an acute mechanical ileus situation and defined an interval surgical approach based on 2 steps.\n\n【13】In the first step， a loop transverse colostomy with intestinal de-compression was urgently performed at the same day of diag-nosis (gestational week 29.8). Intraoperative fetal monitoringshowed no abnormalities. The postoperative recovery pro-gressed rapidly and without complications， and the patient was discharged 1 week after surgery. The sonographic weight estimation (fetometry) at discharge showed an AGA-fetus (ad-equate for gestational age) with growth at the 49th percentile(approximately 1817 g). A staging MRI performed after surgery showed locally metastatic lymph nodes . According to the German guidelines for colorectal cancer， a chest X-ray was performed， and pulmonary metastases were excluded. At gestational week 32.8， the patient was admitted for the sec-ond surgical step. A preoperative colonoscopy showed no evi-dence of malignancies in the other remaining parts of the co-Ion. An elective primary cesarean delivery was performed by medial laparotomy， followed by open oncological sigmoid re-section with complete mesocolic excision and end-to-end de-scendorectostomy. After delivery of the baby (APGAR score4/9/10) ， a standard dose of oxytocin (3 IU intravenous bo-lus plus 10 IU in 500 mL NaCl) was administered， with suffi-cient uterine contraction facilitating the surgical field for colon resection. Thus， the surgical approach for oncological resec-tion could be performed without further difficulties after ad-equate contraction of the uterus. During surgery， a palpable tumor mass with locally metastatic lymph nodes at the sig-moid colon was identified. Further surgical exploration and ul-trasound of the liver did not reveal any metastatic lesions. A loop transverse colostomy was left for anastomosis protection.\n\n【14】The final pathological staging according to the UICC classifi-cation  was adenocarcinoma， high grade(G2-3)， pT3， pN2b (9/17)， L1，V1， Pn1， and RO. The carcinoem-bryonic antigen level was within the reference range.According to the international guidelines by stage grouping of colon can-cer IllC， initiation of an adjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFOX(fluorouracil， leucovorin， and oxaliplatin) was recommended. Due to the high urgency of adjuvant treatment in UICC stage IIIC in a young patient， we recommended performing a stoma reversal after the completion of chemotherapy.\n\n【15】Owing to the prematurity of the baby， the patient remained in the hospital until postoperative day 12. Despite the treatment of the mother and the resulting prematurity， the baby was healthy and had a birth weight appropriate to the gestational age. It was admitted to the neonatal clinic for observation for the first 6 days. No postoperative complications occurred， and the mother and baby were discharged in good health. Outpatient genetic counseling was provided. Data acquisition and process-ing were carried out with the signed approval of the patient.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】In this report， we describe a case of colon cancer during preg-nancy. Without causing a relevant delay in cancer therapy， wewere able to treat the tumor using a 2-stage surgical approach without compromising the safety of the mother and child. In the first step， we urgently treated the acute bowel obstruction with a loop transverse colostomy and intestinal decompres-sion. This allowed us to wait until the fetus was sufficiently developed to reduce the risk of prematurity before perform-ing an elective cesarean delivery， followed by resection of the tumor in the second step.\n\n【18】With this case report， we would like to contribute to the scarce literature dealing with these rare cases. We report on the2-stage management method we used， which met the main premises of our therapeutic goal. On the one hand， we were able to effectively remove the colorectal carcinoma， and on the oth-er， we were able to ensure the safety of both mother and fetus.\n\n【19】Nevertheless，there are no internationally standardized treat-ment guidelines. Saif et al suggested that the treatment of colorectal carcinoma during pregnancy is based on the gesta-tional age of the fetus， tumor stage， and the need for urgent or elective surgery .\n\n【20】To accomplish the best possible oncological outcome and pre-vent fetal complications， the implementation of a multidisci-plinary approach is necessary. Oncological tests must be per-formed in order to establish an intervention plan ， but with the focus on avoiding tests that can lead to teratogenic al-terations of the fetus . If colon cancer is suspected， a colo-noscopy can be performed without risking any harm to the fetus. In this context， MRI is recommended for staging . Approximately 10% to 29% of colon cancer cases are indicat-ed by bowel obstruction， for which emergency surgery must be performed . In pregnant patients， a differential diag-nosis has to be made with pregnancy obstipation， which can be a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.\n\n【21】However， emergency resection of a colon tumor with acute bowel obstruction is related to high morbidity and mortality for the patients . In cases of stenotic colon cancer with ileus， there are various possible types of emergency inter-ventions described. Owing to the high morbidity of a primaryoncological colon resection， bridging techniques must be eval-uated . Patients with left-sided obstructive colon cancer are traditionally treated with a decompressing stoma or stent implantation. The timing of cesarean delivery should be deter-mined by interdisciplinary consensus. In our case， late prema-turity was accepted in the presence of advanced tumor dis-ease and necessity of timely oncologic therapy.\n\n【22】In conclusion， the treatment of colon or colorectal cancer dur-ing pregnancy raises profound ethical and medicolegal ques-tions because of the disparate and often conflicting interests of mother and fetus. The management depends on the pa-tient's age， desire for future pregnancy， gestational age，can-cer stage， and religious principles. It also depends on operative and technical difficulties and the need for elective or emer-gency surgery. Thus， it is inevitable that management should be individualized. An international database managed by a multidisciplinary team of specialists for the implementation of guidelines should be considered.\n\n【23】Conclusions\n\n【24】Vomiting in late pregnancy with persistent constipation， ab-dominal pain， and distension， even after medical measures， can be a sign of underlying mechanical obstruction due to ma-lignancy. Gastrointestinal malignancy should be kept as a dif-ferential diagnosis.\n\n【25】In cases of colorectal cancer during pregnancy， an individu-al therapy concept has to be addressed by a multidisciplinary team. The balance between early oncological resection and leaving time for fetal development is a complex medical chal-lenge. Staged surgical approaches should be considered in or-der to reduce morbidity for the patient and the fetus.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are crucial steps in preventing complications. There is a lack of consensus when it comes to therapy recommendations such as treatment with anticoagulation， throm-bolysis， or surgical thrombectomy.\n\n【1】Case Report： A 74-year-old woman presented with acute peripheral ischemia in the left and right lower limbs. After running a diagnostic workup， we found a history of fatigue and dyspnea in the preceding 2 weeks； and an echocar-diographic examination revealed a large floating mass in the left ventricle with a severely reduced LV ejection fraction of 10-15%. Coronary heart disease was diagnosed with stenosis of the circumflex artery and posteri-or branch of the right coronary artery， but not necessitating acute treatment.\n\n【2】The decision to operate on our patient was based on the acute situation and mobile form of the thrombi as toprevent further thromboembolic complications， and the surgical procedure was performed via a median stemot-omy using a left ventricular apical approach due to the size and deep embedment in the ventricular trabeculae.\n\n【3】Conclusions： To date there is no standardized therapy in the guidelines for treatment of LV thrombi. Surgical thrombectomy can be performed in patients with mobile and protruding thrombi. In such cases surgery should be performed immediately due to the high risk of systemic embolism.\n\n【4】Keywords： Heart Ventricles·Thromboembolism·Thrombosis\n\n【5】Left ventricular thrombus formation is a serious complica-tion of cardiogenic diseases such as myocarditis or myocardi-al infarction， followed by inflammatory reactions of the myo cardium resulting in excessive coagulopathy. Thrombi in the cavities of the heart often result in acute embolic events that can have cerebral effects， or systemic embolic events with in-creased morbidity and mortality when left untreated ， thus necessitating a clearly defined stringent treatment algorithm to prevent serious complications of left ventricular thrombus. We report a rare case of a 74-year-old woman with a combi-nation of pathologies due to a massive thrombus in the left ventricle including acute peripheral ischemia， cardiac decom-pensation， and combined valve pathology， treated successful-ly via a left ventricular apical approach.\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】A 74-year-old woman presented with acute peripheral isch-emia in the left and right lower limbs， necessitating emergent thromboembolectomy followed by extensive fasciotomy due to acute ischemia. Diagnostic workup revealed a history of fa-tigue and dyspnea in the preceding 2 weeks. Echocardiographic examination demonstrated a large mass of 4.5x4.2 cm in the left ventricle， in parts adhering to the apex and septum， float-ing in other parts . LV ejection fraction was se-verely reduced to 10-15%， the apical portions of the left ven-tricle were akinetic， and the end-diastolic ventricular diameter was 65 mm. Mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation was not-ed. Pulmonary artery pressure was elevated at 40 mmHg and coronary angiography revealed 2-vessel disease with 60% cir-cumflex stenosis and 80% stenosis of the small right posteri-or branch without need for acute therapy . A PCI treatment of the marginal branch stenosis was planned for a later intervention.\n\n【8】An immediate decision for emergent surgical embolectomy led to referral， and upon admission the patient presented with car-diogenic shock requiring inotrope medication in high doses. The patient presented with troponin levels of 517 pg/L and CK-Mb levels of 73 U/L， postulating a possible prior myocar-dial infarct as etiogenetic for thrombus formation.\n\n【9】The surgical procedure was performed via a median sternot-omy. After establishment of extracorporeal circulation， cross clamp and antegrade cardioplegia with cold crystalloid solu-tion was delivered via the aortic root for myocardial protec-tion. After incision of the LV apex， a large 4.5x4.2 cm throm-bus was found to be broadly attached to the septal and lateral wall， with thrombus deeply attached in the trabecular mus-cles. There was no need for coronary reconstruction via theanatomical approach. Thrombus age was approximately 10-14days， with older and newer portions. Thorough and meticu-lous extraction was performed， cleaning and flushing of the ventricle was tedious， but the surgery was straight-forward and the postoperative course was without any complications.\n\n【10】In the postoperative echocardiographic examination， the left ventricle was observed to be completely free from throm-bus， and decreased left ventricular contractility and akinesia at the apex remained identical to the preoperative function. Coagulation disorders were excluded by additional laborato-ry tests.\n\n【11】The histopathological examination demonstrated fresh throm-bus material with typical stratification without endocardiumparts. Postoperatively， the patient had an uneventful hospital stay. Lower limb extended fasciotomy and postischemic oe-dema were treated with vacuum therapy until secondary clo-sure of the wound. She was transferred to her referring hos-pital on postoperative day 12.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Left ventricular thrombus formation is a complication in patients with wall motion abnormalities， usually following myocardial infarction， dilated cardiomyopathy， or myocarditis. Syndromes resulting in hypercoagulopathy such as protein S and C defi-ciency and antiphospholipid syndrome have also been involved in LV thrombus formation in muscular dystrophies， Behcet'sdisease， and Loeffler's endocardial fibrosis， among others  Reports show that LV thrombus increases the risk of peripher-al embolization， as in our patient ， particularly in patients with thrombus protrusion into the ventricular cavity and also in cases of increased mobility .\n\n【14】Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are crucial to prevent complications. Although echocardiography is the most frequent-ly used diagnostic method， a study has shown that magnetic resonance imaging has the highest sensitivity and specificity for LV thrombus diagnosis in comparison with a transthorac-ic echocardiography . Other reports show improved echo-cardiographic sensitivity to large protruding LV thrombiwhen the clinical indication was specifically for LV thrombus eval-uation.\n\n【15】To date there is no standardized therapy in the guidelines for treatment of LV thrombi. Surgical thrombectomy， treatment with low molecular weight or unfractionated heparin， new oral anticoagulation therapy， and thrombolysis are various options with a wide spectrum of results. Several studies show a very high rate of systemic embolic complications after treatment with fibrinolytics， with consequent high risk of hemorrhagic events . There have been few studies on the surgical treatment of LV thrombi and are mostly case reports or case series showing none of these patients to develop thromboem-bolism after surgical treatment . The decision to operate on our patient was based on the mobility of the thrombi and to prevent further thromboembolic complications.\n\n【16】Due to several reasons， we decided to perform the surgical procedure via the left ventricular apex. The magnitude of the thrombus and the deep embedding in the trabeculae was deemed technically more challenging using a transmitral ap proach. The akinetic apex and the severely reduced left ven-tricular contractility supported the concept of a left ventricular approach， with the goal of reducing left ventricular dimension and thus possibly improving the left ventricular morphology Alternative approaches such as via a left atriotomy or through the aorta in concomitant aortic valve surgeries  have been described but were not implemented due to the above reasons.\n\n【17】Conclusions\n\n【18】Since there are no evidence-based guidelines for the treat-ment of LV thrombi， individual treatment options based on the risk of surgery， embolization， and bleeding must be con-sidered. Surgical thrombectomy can be performed in patients with mobile and protruding thrombi. Surgery should be per-formed without delay due to the high risk of systemic embolism.\n\n【19】All figures submitted have been created by the authors who confirm that the images are original with no duplication and have not been previously published in whole or in part.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "5921a1d5-db94-466e-b515-ee55c5a75317", "title": null, "text": "【0】Background： Acute kidney injury is one of the most common complications in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2，occurring in up to 7% of cases and increasing to 23% in patients treated in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The objective of this report was to describe the clinical case of a patient infected by SARS-CoV-2 who developed acute renal injury， probably secondary to this infection.\n\n【1】Case Report：\n\n【2】On 1 April 2020， a 65-year-old woman presented to the emergency service of the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases， Mexico City with a 15-day history of dry cough and subjective fever. Finally， the following diagno-ses were integrated： Acute renal injury of etiology to be determined (acute chronic kidney disease secondary to T2DM vs. acute renal injury by SARS-CoV-2) and COVID-19. The patient had a typical presentation of severe COVID-19， evidencing all the risk and severity factors for this disease. However， after being admitted to the hospital， she showed evidence of acute renal injury. Although the renal injury may have been due to microan-giopathic damage caused by chronic hypertension and diabetes， it is imperative to consider the possibility that such exacerbation contributes to SARS-CoV-2 infection or synergy of multiple factors.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】Every aspect of this pandemic remains unclear. The formulation of hypotheses to explain the physiopatholog-ical mechanisms by which this new virus can cause mortality in infected patients may help reduce mortality rates and control the pandemic itself.\n\n【5】MeSH Ke ywo rds： Acute Kidney Injury·COVID-19· Diabetes Mellitus · Hypertension·SARS VirusCoronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has never before affected health systems worldwide， and， despite scientific and tech-nological advances， the pandemic has not been optimally controlled. As of 9 July 2020， the World Health Organization(WHO) reported a total of 11 669 259 confirmed cases world-wide， including 539 906 deaths ， while in Mexico during the same period， the Secretary of Health reported 275 003 con-firmed cases with 32 796 deaths and an estimated worldwide mortality rate of 4.6%.\n\n【6】Acute kidney injury is one of the most common complications in patients infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)， occurring in up to 7% of cas-es and increasing to 23% in patients treated in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) .\n\n【7】Angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the cellular entry point of the 3 members of the coronavirus family that have caused global health problems- Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)， Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)， and COVID-19. This receptor has also been found in cardiac， intestinal， pulmonary， hepatic， and renal cells .\n\n【8】There have been 3 mechanisms proposed through which SARS-CoV-2 can injure the kidneys： 1) direct damage of kidney cells by the virus， as this new coronavirus has 10-20 times great-er affinity for the ACE2 receptor；2) cytokine-mediated injury， especially by IL2， 7， and 10， and granulocyte colony-stimulat-ing factor， among others； and 3) by excessive activation of T lymphocytes. These pathophysiological mechanisms together with others such as a state of hypoperfusion due to hypovo lemia can jointly or individually lead to acute renal injury .\n\n【9】Although the renal cells most affected in COVID-19 are in the renal tubular system， glomerular filtration is also under-mined to a greater or lesser extent， which explains the disor-ders of both urinary sediment and metabolites such as creat-inine and ureic nitrogen. Mild proteinuria is the most common sign， followed by elevation of urea nitrogen (27%) and eleva-tion of serum creatinine (19%). Hypodensity of the renal pa-renchyma has been demonstrated on CT scans to be a sign of inflammation .\n\n【10】A retrospective patient cohort study by Yan Deng et al. in Wuhan，China， found that creatinine levels and the likelihood of developing acute kidney injury were significantly higher in pa-tients who died from COVID-19 than in those who recovered .\n\n【11】Regarding guidelines for treatment of acute kidney injury in COVID-19 disease， Ronco et al. proposed that in addition tokidney-protection measures (e.g.， avoiding nephrotoxic agents， monitoring of creatinine and urinary output， balance adjust-ment， and avoiding volume overload or hypovolemia)， it is im-portant to consider early continuous replacement therapy for kidney function as the first treatment option if conservative measures fail  (especially in hemodynamically unstable pa-tients)， in addition to sequential extracorporeal support of or-gans (ECOS) . Guangchang et al. also found that adequate management of pneumonia and prevention of barotrauma provided renal protection .\n\n【12】Martinez Rojas et al. postulated that “cytokine storm”， especial-ly involving IL-6， is the main cause of renal dysfunction. This， together with a decrease in blood volume and inflammation of the renal parenchyma， as well as microthrombosis of the renal arteries， severely impair renal functions. From this de-rives the therapeutic suggestion of the use of IL-6 inhibitors and extracorporeal circulation therapies to eliminate or miti-gate cytokines that directly affect the kidney .\n\n【13】Finally， Ali et al. proposed that renal damage in many patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 impairs their ability to eliminate and metabolize the drugs used for their treatment and increases mortality . The objective of the present report was to de-scribe the case of a SARS-CoV-2-infected patient who devel-oped acute renal injury， probably secondary to this infection.\n\n【14】Case Report\n\n【15】On 1 April 2020， a 65-year-old woman presented to an emer-gency care clinic in the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases， Mexico City， with a 15-day history of dry cough and subjective fever.\n\n【16】She had a 25-year history of both type 2 diabetes mellitus(treated with insulin NPH 48 International Units in the morn-ing 20 International Units in the night) and high blood pres-sure (treated with Losartan 50 mg every 24 h and Amlodipine5 mg every 24 h). She reported no history of recent travel or any contact with COVID-19-positive patients.\n\n【17】In the physical examination， the patient was febrile， hypoten-sive， tachycardic， and tachypneic. Lung auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds in both lung fields and oxygen sat-uration of 80% with 15 L Due to hypoxemia and shortness of breath， we provided airway management in assisted con-trol mode and high volumes， and ventilator parameters were established. After ventilatory parameters were stabilized，the patient was placed in prone position.\n\n【18】That same day， she presented a urinary volume reduction and creatinine of 6.10， revealing a kidney injury AKIN ⅢII， Sotreatment with furosemide was initiated， showing good re-sponse. Subsequently， she presented glucose up to 435 mg/dl， so an insulin pump was started； the patient was sent to the Intensive Care Unit due to acute respiratory syndrome and metabolic abnormalities.\n\n【19】A CT scan revealed patches of ground-glass opacities in both lung fields， with subpleural predominance and with a tendency to consolidation， discreetly hypodense renal parenchyma (27.34Hounsfield units)， and the renal arteries and veins showed no visible morphological alterations .\n\n【20】The microbiology reports of 28 March 2020 were positive for SARS-CoV2， which was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using the BD-MAX system (Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Systems， Sparks， MD， USA) and approved by the Institute for Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference (InDRE) according to the Berlin Protocol suggested by the WHO， and the patient was negative for AH1N1 and seasonal influenza as shown by nasopharyngeal exudate and bronchial aspiration. The blood culture of peripheral blood reported the isolation of co-agulase-negative Staphylococcus. The urine culture on 29 March2020 revealed K. pneumoniae and E. Coli， both pan-sensitive.\n\n【21】Blood analysis showed a clear increase in white cells and a marked lymphopenia (5.9%)， D-dimer within normal ranges， elevated CPK levels ， clear elevation of LDH， hypoalbu-minemia， and hypertriglyceridemia.\n\n【22】Finally， 2 diagnoses were integrated： acute renal injury of eti-ology to be determined (acute chronic renal injury secondary to T2DM vs. acute renal injury by SARS-CoV2) and COVID-19.\n\n【23】The patient was treated with renal protection and supportive measures， as well as renal replacement therapy by hemodialysis.\n\n【24】Discussion\n\n【25】Despite efforts of the scientific community to understand vari-ous aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic，several factors remain unclear. The relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute kidney injury is still debated by several authors. In a pa-tient cohort analyzed by Wang et al.， the authors concluded that the infection by this new virus is not related to the occur-rence of acute kidney failure ； however， the number of pa-tients analyzed was low， and the fact that no genetic material of the virus was found in urine samples does not exclude the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause kidney damage by other mechanisms such as cytokine storm or direct cyto-pathic effect. Xiu-Wu Pan et al. proposed that podocytes and proximal contoured tubule cells are target cells because they found overexpression of receptors was necessary for the virus to infect human cells . Underexpression of ACE2 receptors at the renal level has been identified in diabetic patients ， which could explain the acute kidney injury presented by our patient. Also， Li et al. found that early-stage viremia of this in-fection has a duration of 7-14 days ， which corresponds with the time elapsed in the present case between the onset of symptoms and aggravation of respiratory injuries.\n\n【26】Our patient had lymphopenia， which， according to Li Tan et al.， is one of the main predictors of severity and mortality in pa-tients infected by SARS-CoV-2 . No proteinuria was found， but the levels of urea and creatinine were higher than the normal range.\n\n【27】Our patient had a typical presentation of severe COVID-19， with all the risk factors already described for such patients；however， she was admitted due to acute renal injury， which might have been due to microangiopathic damage caused by her chronic hypertension and diabetes. It is imperative to con-sider that such an exacerbation could have been due to SARS-CoV-2 infection， or to the synergy of multiple factors， such as damage caused by marked elevation of CPK and DHL， the state of hypotension and secondary hypoperfusion， and the bacte ria isolated in the general urine test.\n\n【28】Finally， despite tomographic evidence of a slight decrease in re-nal parenchyma density reported in acute renal lesions caused by SARS-CoV-2， it is important to perform a renal biopsy or a PCR analysis of renal samples to identify the presence of the virus genetic material in the kidneys.\n\n【29】The initial treatment of renal failure established in the present case coincides with that recommended in the current litera-ture on acute renal failure in COVID-19 patients ， which consists of renal support and protection measures， as well as early introduction of renal replacement therapies. Interleukin6 inhibitors were not used in our patient because it was not possible to quantify IL-6 plasma levels， and waiting for the iso-lation of microorganisms in blood and urine put the patient at risk for developing a serious state of infection.\n\n【30】We are still faced with an inconclusive picture of every aspect of this pandemic. The formulation of hypotheses to explain the physiopathological mechanisms through which this new virus can increase mortality in infected patients could help reduce mortality and control the pandemic itself.\n\n【31】This case report may provide a basis for further development and hypotheses by the medical and scientific community to understand all possible scenarios in which the virus can dam-age extra-pulmonary organs.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Pinworm infections， on the other hand， are not as common among adults in the United States.\n\n【2】Case Report： Based on computed tomography features， a 24-year-old female patient with a history of multiple autoimmune disorders presented with abdominal pain and was diagnosed recently with Crohn’s disease. Colonoscopy was significant for pinworms seen throughout the colon. Colonic biopsy was negative for inflammatory bowel dis-ease (IBD)-related changes.\n\n【3】Conclusions： The diagnosis of IBD is a serious label that requires biopsy confirmation before committing to possibly life-long treatment and possible adverse effects. Even in the most typical patient and when the presentation and imaging are classical， uncommon conditions (like Enterobius infection in this case) may preclude appropriate diagnosis and management.\n\n【4】MeSH Keywords： Colonoscopy· Crohn Disease· Enterobius · Inflammatory Bowel DiseasesInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is well recognized in devel-oped countries and is generally among the differential diag-noses of young patients presenting with refractory diarrhea once other more common etiologies have been excluded.IBD includes 2 entities： ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease(CD). CD has a prevalence of 201 per 100 000 population while UC has a prevalence of 238 per 100 000 population in the United States . In contrast， Enterobius vermicularis in-fections are not commonly seen in everyday practice and are not considered in the differential of common gastrointestinal complaints. This diagnosis is only considered when travel to endemic areas is involved. However， Enterobiasis (also known as pinworm) is the most common helminthic infection in the US and Western Europe. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that about 40 million persons are infected in the United States. While patients are commonly as-ymptomatic， gastrointestinal manifestations， such as abdom-inal pain and diarrhea， may occur. Diagnosis is usually made by microscopic visualization of Enterobius eggs and treat-ment consists of a course of an anti-helminthic agent， such as Albendazole . We present the case of a patient with persistent diarrhea， who was presumed to have IBD without consideration of Enterobiasis， given the rarity of this diagnosis in everyday practice. CD was high on the differential because a previous CT abdomen showed inflammatory changes con-fined to the distal ileum. We wish to bring awareness to such an under-recognized but prevalent diagnosis here in the US.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】A 24-year-old white woman female was admitted for the eval-uation of intolerable abdominal pain and bloating for the past10 days prior to admission， associated with nausea， but no vomiting， fever， or diarrhea. She had a past medical history significant for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis A， chronic pericar-ditis， pulmonary arterial hypertension， and past surgical his-tory of cholecystectomy. She had similar episodes before and was told she had Crohn's disease at another facility， based on a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen but she never had a colonoscopy. The patient denied sick contacts or history of recent travel.\n\n【7】A CT abdomen showed wall thickening with submucosal fat at the terminal ileum ， which is nonspecific but can be seen with chronic inflammatory processes such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. She underwent colonoscopy， which showed parasites in the transverse colon， the ascending colon， and in the cecum . Fluid aspiration was performed through the scope suction channel. Sample(s) were sent forova and parasites and was positive for Enterobius vermicularis(pinworms). Ilial biopsy was negative for IBD-related changes.\n\n【8】On subsequent questioning， she endorsed living in a wood-ed area where it had been rainy， with muddy grounds around her house. She also said she and her family usually consume private well water that occasionally dries out. This can be the route of infection (contaminated drinking water) given the lack of pertinent travel history or sick contacts to indicate the clas-sic fecal-oral transmission.\n\n【9】The patient received 1 dose of Albendazole with subsequent improvement of her pain and she was discharged with a pre-scription for Albendazole to be taken for 2 weeks and instruc-tions to have her children and partner treated.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】This is a case where a patient had a history of autoimmune disease， was not an immigrant/traveler from a helminthes-en-demic area， and had radiological features of Crohn’s disease. In this case endoscopy and histopathology yielded a radically different diagnosis of colonic pinworm， with the subsequent-ly appropriate treatment with anti-helminthic medications.\n\n【12】We seek to delineate that even in an apparently typical patient， inflammatory bowel disease should always be endoscopical-ly confirmed and biopsy proven. While it was intuitive to pro-ceed with the management of inflammatory bowel disease in our case， clinicians must keep in mind that colonoscopy is the cornerstone in such cases to exclude other causes of the pa-tient's presentation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The clinical suspicion of the combined pathology is low due to its rarity and the suspicion of pseudochylothorax， which is usually caused by tuberculosis.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】We present our case of right-sided chylothorax with tuberculous empyema thoracis after CABG. Clinical suspicion of chylothorax was confirmed biochemically (pleural fluid analysis) after observ-ing that the intraoperatively placed thoracostomy tube drained approximately 500 cc of seropu-rulent white-to-yellow fluid that showed no debris or clotting tendency. Zeihl-Neelsen staining was done and repeated 3 times with positive results.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】Because of the low sensitivity of microbiological examinations of pleural fluid for tubercle bacilli， biopsy of pleura and/or tissue culture should be the method of choice in the diagnosis ofTB.\n\n【6】key words：\n\n【7】TB post CABG ·pleural effusion post CABG · TB pleural effusion post coronary artery bypass graftingTuberculosis (TB) remains a serious public health prob-lem worldwide. Despite the improvement of health care systems， TB still of major concern in the developing coun-tries and its rising incidence has been of increasing con-cern even in the developed world. Tuberculous and post-tuberculous effusions are common findings that respond to medical treatment and occasionally aspiration. In the other hand， the development of tuberculous empyema is associat-ed with high mortality and morbidity unless surgically treat-ed. Chylothorax is an uncommon but well known compli-cation of intrathoracic surgery. This report outlines a rare case of combined chylothorax with tuberculous empyema thoracis occurring after CABG.\n\n【8】CASE REPORT\n\n【9】A 62-year-old male patient who was having renal impairment and left-sided paraplegia due to a stroke l week before sur-gery， presented with acute anterior myocardial infarction with severe left ventricular dysfunction that had necessitated emergency CABG. The procedure was performed through a median sternotomy. A saphenous vein graft was anasto-mosed to the left marginal branch and another vein graft was anastomosed to the distal right coronary artery and the left internal thoracic artery to the left anterior descending artery. The right pleura remained grossly in tact. The post-operative course was uneventful and the patient was dis-charged on the 8ih postoperative day. Two weeks after the patient's discharge， he presented to the emergency room with shortness of breath (S.O.B). Chest X-ray showed right-sided pleural effusion. A thoracostomy tube was inserted and500cc of seropurulent fluid was drained. During the first 3days post-insertion， there was drainage of 400-500 ml/day of a sero-purulent， white-to-yellow free fluid that showed no debris or clotting tendency. Accordingly， a clinical sus-picion of chylothorax was raised and confirmed biochem-ically (pleural fluid TG level was 1.24 mmol/l， cholesterol level was 1.16mmol/1 and TG/Cholesterol ratio was great-er than 1). According to these laboratory results， a diagno-sis of chylothorax was confirmed. A conservative treatment with nothing per mouth and total parenteral nutrition was chosen and started. In addition， the pleural fluid was Ziehl-Neelsen positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). The Infectious Disease Team (IDT) was consulted， so the Ziehl-Neelsen was repeated twice with positive results， adding to the diag-nosis of tuberculous empyema thoracis. No malignant cells were detected. Anti-TB medication was started after the 7t day and the patient was followed by IDT. CT of the chest showed a right-sided seropneumothorax and collapse con-solidation of the right lower lobe with enhancement of the parietal pleura suggestive of empyema thoracis， as well as a mild left-sided effusion.\n\n【10】Video-assisted thoracoscopic debridement of this tubercu-lous empyema， as well as pleural biopsy to confirm the di-agnosis of tuberculous empyema thoracis， was planned but not performed due to the very limited performance status of the patient. The course of treatment was complicated by sepsis. The patient had multiorgan failure and died 37 days after the operation.\n\n【11】DISCUSSION\n\n【12】Chylothorax is a recognized complication of intrathoracic surgery， with an incidence of 0.25% to 0.50% reported in the international literature. On the other hand， its acCUI-rence after CABG is extremely rare .\n\n【13】Chylothorax is characterized by the leakage of chyle into the pleural cavity. This condition may have several etiolo-gies and may be classified as congenital， traumatic， obstruct-ed or spontaneous .\n\n【14】Tuberculous empyema represents a chronic， active infec-tion of the pleural space that contains a large number of tubercle bacilli. It is rare compared with tuberculous pleu-ral effusions that result from an exaggerated inflammato-ry response to a localized paucibacillary pleural infection with tuberculosis .\n\n【15】The role of pleural biopsy in rapid diagnosis of TB pleuri-sy is well established . Finding acid-fast bacilli by stain-ing the biopsy specimen has been reported useful， but false-positive results have been reported， so it has not been proven to be reliable. Culture of pleural biopsy is superior for the detection of TB bacilli to culture of any other ma-terial available. At least 4 separate biopsy specimens of the pleura should be obtained . Three of these specimens should be sent for histological studies and the 4h should be cultured for M. tuberculosis， since the pleural biopsy culture is sometimes positive when there are no granulomas in the pleura. With both histological and microbiological studies of the pleura， diagnostic yields as high as 86% have been reported for pleural TB. Repeated biopsy might be done if the first is negative and TB is suspected . This increases the yield to 80-90%.\n\n【16】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【17】Combined chylothorax and tuberculous empyema thora-cis is a rare complication after CABG. Any late or unusual pleural effusion need to be investigated for TB， especially in endemic areas. Because of the low sensitivity of microbi-ological examinations of pleural fluid for tubercle bacilli， biopsy of pleura and/or tissue culture should be the meth-od of choice in the diagnosis ofTB.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

She was not vaccinated against influenza. Before and upon pre-sentation to our facility， she was diagnosed with influenza B virus infection and was positive for streptococcal meningitis. A CT head revealed pneumocephalus， likely due to Streptococcus infection. She was treated with antibiotics， and a repeat CT head showed resolution of the lesion.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】Bacterial pneumocephalus in the background of influenza is an uncommon occurrence. Influenza vaccina-tion and early diagnosis with a CT of the head and prompt initiation of antibiotics are essential in preventing mortality.\n\n【5】MeSH Keywords： Influenza B virus ·Meningitis· Pneumocephalus· Streptococcus pneumoniaeInfluenza is a disease of the respiratory tract diagnosed at any time of the year， but it is most common during the fall and winter . Complications directly caused by influenza manifest in some patients， including acute respiratory dis-tress syndrome， myocarditis， rhabdomyolysis and encephali-tis . Secondary bacterial infections such as bacterial pneu-monia also develop and typical bacterial species involved are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus . An advanced complica-tion like pneumocephalus after a diagnosis with influenza B virus infection is unusual. Pneumocephalus， which is air with-in the brain parenchyma， is frequently associated with head trauma， intracranial pathologies or neurological surgery . Direct etiologies related to infections are less prevalent and require aggressive management to reduce mortality. Here， we describe a rare complication of influenza B virus infection by delineating a case of bacterial meningitis and pneumocepha-lus in a patient with influenza B virus infection.\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】A 51-year-old woman with a past medical history of iron defi-ciency anemia and morbid obesity presented to the Emergency Department in early winter because of worsening mental sta-tus over seven days. She was unvaccinated against influenza and was diagnosed with influenza a few days earlier at an ur-gent care clinic. A few hours before presentation she was retch-ing and unable to talk. A family member denied any recent history of head trauma or surgery. Her vital signs revealed a temperature of 104.4°F (40.2℃)， puse rate of 123 beats per minute， blood pressure of 160/81 mmHg， respiratory rate of20 cycles per minute， and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. Her Glasgow Coma Scale was nine. On physical examina-tion her head inspection was normal， pupils were equal and reactive to light， she had no nuchal rigidity， and Brudzinski sign was negative. The rest of the examination was unremark-able. She was alert and moved all extremities but was not fol-lowing commands.\n\n【8】Laboratory results revealed she was positive for influenza B antigen but because of the possibility of an acute intracranial pathology she had an urgent computed tomography (CT) of the head . It revealed pneumocephalus in the left pa-rietal occipital vertex，acute-on-chronic sinusitis， and left mid-dle ear fluid with left mastoid air cell effusion. A chest x-ray was unremarkable.Other laboratory investigations were sig-nificant for a white cell count of 18 400/ul with neutrophil percent of 91.6， international normalized ratio of 1.26， lac-tic acid of 2.3 mmol/L， hemoglobin A1c of 7.9%， and serum glucose of 266 mg/dL A urinalysis revealed glucose of great-er than 1000 mg/dL and ketones of 80. An electrocardiogramdemonstrated sinus tachycardia with occasional premature ventricular complexes.\n\n【9】Meningitis was highly suspected and she was started on empiric antibiotics of intravenous ceftriaxone (2 gm every 12 hours)， intravenous meropenem (2 gm every 8 hours)， and intrave-nous vancomycin (1 gm every 12 hours). She was also treated with intravenous dexamethasone (10 mg every 6 hours)， a full course of oral oseltamivir， and parenteral insulin. Subsequent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed a hazy appearance， a white count of 387/mm， a red count of 409/mm’， glucose of90 mg/dL， and a total protein of 174.6 mg/dL The CSF microbi-ology was positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen， but the Gram stain was negative and the CSF did not grow any organisms. A blood culture grew Streptococcus pneumoniae. She decompensated mentally and had multiple seizures after a few days， which required intubation four days later for air-way protection. She was also started on levetiracetam for sei-zures. Fortunately， she improved clinically and she regained her mental state to her previous baseline without residual neurological deficits. A CT head  was repeated 15days after presentation showing complete resolution of the pneumocephalus.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Influenza virus infections are most prevalent during the fall and winter . The most common types are influenza A and B， belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae viruses . Between 2000and 2018， influenza B was the main cause of influenza in about25% of cases globally . It often infects the respiratory tract and it has been linked to several complications like myocar-ditis， encephalitis， ophthalmitis， and acute kidney failure .\n\n【12】Secondary bacterial infections can also manifest in patients\n\n【13】with influenza. Streptococcus pneumoniae， Staphylococcus au-\n\n【14】reus， and Hemophilus influenza have been identified in causing bacterial pneumonia in patients with influenza . Nonetheless， further complications due to secondary bacterial infections have not been well documented.\n\n【15】Our patient had a distinctive situation because she devel-oped secondary streptococcal bacteremia and meningitis with subsequent pneumocephalus after a recent diagno-sis of influenza B virus infection. A literature search result-ed in articles that discussed pneumocephalus but only a few implicated Streptococcus pneumoniae. Some of the cases of pneumocephalus were due to head traumas or neurosurgical interventions . Other causes were secondary to intra-cranial anatomic pathologies and infections . Based on the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of our patient， we searched for articles about pneumococcal meningitis with pneumocephalus， with emphasis on influenza diagnosis. In a2019 case report by Barry et al.， the patient developed pneu-mococcal meningitis with pneumocephalus in the setting of mastoiditis and sinusitis， but the pneumocephalus resolved after treatment with antibiotics . In another case report， the patient was also treated with antibiotics against pneu-mococcal pneumocephalus in the background of sinusitis， although there was no laboratory evidence of Streptococcus pneumoniae . Other case reports we reviewed were simi-lar to the ones that have been discussed . Our patient also had CT evidence of acute-on-chronic sinusitis with mas-toid effusion， but a diagnosis with influenza Binfection makes our case unique.\n\n【16】We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for articles on pneumocephalus development in the context of influenza， using the keywords\"pneumocephalus\"，“flu\"，and \"influenza\". However， just one case was reported where pneumocephalus in a 9-year-old boy was determined to be the result of influ-enza， but no laboratory evidence of influenza was document-ed in the article . Pneumocephalus arises because of an entrapped air that moves from outside into the cranial cavity or when CSF loss causes negative intracranial pressure . Our patient was diagnosed with influenza at an urgent care center. Her mental state deteriorated， prompting a visit to our medical center， where clinical evaluation revealed influenza B infection with pneumococcal meningitis and pneumocephalus.\n\n【17】We believe a recent diagnosis with influenza was the potentiat-ing factor that eventually led to pneumocephalus. Vaccination against the influenza viruses and recognition of influenza complications and early treatment are important in prevent-ing mortality. We believe our case report is the first to present streptococcal meningitis with resulting pneumocephalus in a patient with evidence of influenza B virus infection. Our pa-tient was managed with antibiotics， and a repeat CT scan of the head showed complete resolution. Our report emphasiz-es the need to continue to educate patients about the bene-fits of influenza vaccination. Clinicians should always keep in mind that a superimposed complication from secondary bac-terial infections in patients with influenza virus infection is not limited to the respiratory system.\n\n【18】Conclusions\n\n【19】Atraumatic pneumocephalus is a rare complication of bacterial infections in a patient with influenza. Our search of the liter-ature revealed just a few cases in which Streptococcus pneu-moniae meningitis resulted in pneumocephalus， and none of the patients had a diagnosis of influenza. Furthermore，only one case report revealed pneumocephalus as a complication of influenza； however， laboratory evidence of influenza was not reported in the case report. Early recognition and treatment help prevent mortality. Emphasis on vaccinations against in-fluenza is an important preventive measure that must be pro-moted by clinicians.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Aim： To study the pattern and trend of STIs during five years  among patients attending the Department of Dermatology， Venereology，and Leprology， Government Medical College and Hospital， Nagpur. Material and methods： Case records of 4552 patients with STIs who attended the Department of Dermatology， Venereology， and Leprology， Government Medical College， Nagpur， for five years， from January 2013 to October 2017， were analysed in this retrospective study. Cases were diagnosed based on clinical presentation and relevant investigations. Results： Most common age group affected was 31-40 years(34.84%). Balanoposthitis was most common STI in (37.98%) followed by cervicovaginal discharge (30.07%)， herpes genitalis (18.65%)， molluscum contagiosum (8.26%)， condylomata acuminata (1.43%)， chancroid (1.43%)， genital scabies(1.03%)， syphilis (0.63%)， urethral discharge (0.48%) and granuloma inguinale (0.11%). About 2.37% of cases were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive. Herpes genitalis (46.29%) was the most common STIs in HIV-positive patients. The venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test was reactive in 0.63% of patients. Conclusions： The study concluded that bacterial STIs like syphilis (0.63%)， chancroid (1.43%)， and granuloma inguinale (0.11%) were less common than viral STIs. The infection rate of syphilis and chancroid has increased dramatically in recent years. Viral STIs were more likely to be associated with HIV than bacterial infections. Balanoposthitis， cervicovaginal discharge and herpes genitalis constitute the major burden of STIs clinic.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS sexually transmitted infections， viral， bacterial， HIV\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a loosely defined con-stellation of infections and syndromes that are epidemiologically heterogeneous， but all of which are almost always or at least often transmitted sexually. Some STIs can also be spread by non-sexual contact with contaminated blood and tissue，breast-feeding or during childbirth. The genital areas are generally warm and moist， ideal for yeast， viruses and bacteria growth. STIs are responsible for an enormous psychosocial and economic morbidity burden in young and sexually active adults. In order to combat this problem， knowledge about the current patterns and trends of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is necessary for properly implementing control measures.\n\n【4】Material and method：\n\n【5】Case records of 4552 patients with STIs who attended the Depart-ment of Dermatology， Venereology， and Leprology， Government Medical College， Nagpur， for five years， from January 2013 to Oc-tober 2017， were analysed in this retrospective study. Cases were diagnosed based on clinical presentation and relevant investiga-tions. Partner identification and condom promotion were also made. All patients were treated as per National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO's) guidelines.\n\n【6】Result\n\n【7】Out of a total of 4552 cases， 2711 (59%) were males， and 1841(41%) were females. There was an evident decline in the total number of female cases during the five years . Males outnumbered females in a ratio of 1.47：1 during the five years， but the ratio varied yearly.\n\n【8】A maximum number of patients were seen in the 31-40 age group (male-20.39%， female-14.45%)，followed by the 21-30age group (male - 16.06%， female -15.11%). A gradual in-crease in the proportion of individuals belonging to the older age groups (≥ 65 years) attending the clinic from 2013 to 2017. All STIs were most commonly seen in the 21-40 years age group except scabies which was most commonly seen in the <20 years age group .\n\n【9】Balanoposthitis constituted the maximum number of cases. There were 1729 (37.98%) cases of balanoposthitis， followed by1369 (30.07%) cases of cervicovaginal discharge and 849 (18.65%) cases of herpes genitalis . In male patients， the most common STI was balanoposthitis (BP) 1729 (63.78%)，followed by herpes genitalis (HG) 568 (20.95%)， molluscum contagiosum(MC) 231 (8.52%)， chancroid 63 (2.32%)， genital wart (GW) 40(1.47%)， genital scabies 35 (1.29%)， urethral discharge (UD) 22(0.81%)， syphilis 19 (0.70%)， granuloma inguinale 4 (0.148%).\n\n| Age  | HG  | GW MC  |  | Syphilis  | Chancroid  | Genital Scabies  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age  | HG  | GW MC  |  | Syphilis  | Chancroid  | Genital Scabies  | Inguinale  |  |\n| <20  | 3  | 0  | 8  | 0  | 0  | 8  | 0  | 40  |\n| 21-30  | 112  | 6  | 70  | 7  | 1  | 4  | 0  | 531  |\n| 31-40  | 61  | 9  | 43  | 1  | 1  | 0  | 1  | 542  |\n| 41-50  | 40  | 5  | 20  | 2  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 196  |\n| 51-60，  | ，49  | 0  | 4  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 44  |\n| \\>60  | 16  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 16  |\n\n| Age  | HG  | GW  | MC  | BP  | Syphilis  | Chancroid  | Genital Scabies  | UD  | Granuloma Inguinale  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| <20  | 3  | 1  | 29  | 8  | 1  | 0  | 19  | 1  | 0  |\n| 21-30  | 196  | 15  | 110  | 313  | 6  | 26  | 15  | 6  | 1  |\n| 31-40  | 142  | 16  | 53  | 668  | 7  | 29  | 1  | 11  | 1  |\n| 41-50  | 84  | 8  | 35  | 454  | 3  | 6  | 0  | 4  | 1  |\n| 51-60  | 70  | 0  | 3  | 211  | 2  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  |\n| \\>60  | 62  | 0  | 1  | 75  | 0  | 2  | 0  | 0  | 0  |\n\n【12】Among females， the most common STI was cervicovagi-nal discharge 1369 (74.36%) followed by herpes genitalis 281(15.26%)， molluscum contagiosum 145 (7.87%)， genital wart 21(1.14%)， genital scabies 12 (0.65%)，syphilis 10 (0.54%)， chancroid2 (0.11%) and granuloma inguinale 1 (0.054%) .\n\n【13】The prevalence of HIV in the present study was 2.37%(108/4552)， out of which 77 were males and 31 were females. VDRL test was reactive in 0.63% of patients. Viral STIs were more common in HIV-positive patients. Out of 108 HIV-positive cases， 50 cases presented with herpes genitalis followed by cervi-covaginal discharge ， balanoposthitis ， urethral discharge， granuloma inguinale ，syphilis ， genital MC ， genital wart .\n\n【14】Molluscum contagiosum showed a declining trend， while herpes genitalis， urethral discharge， cervicovaginal discharge， scabies，balanoposthitis and genital wart showed a static trend during five year period . Syphilis and chancroid cases significantly increased over the past few years. Syphilis  and chancroid  cases were seen during the five years.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】In the current study， maximum STI cases were seen in both sexes in the 21-40 years of age group because this age group is more sexually active， productive and vulnerable to STI acquisition. This is similar to other studies by Chandragupta TS et al.， Devi SA et al. and Saikia L et al.\n\n【17】In our study， males outnumbered females (59% males and41% females). Although STIs are equally prevalent in females， they are less detected because of the asymptomatic nature of most STIs in females， lack of knowledge about STI and their consequences，social and cultural restrictions in attending STIclinics and more likely to attend obstetrics and gynaecological clinic for sexually health related problem. Similar findings were observed by various other authors.\n\n【18】Bacterial STIs were less common， possibly due to the widespread use of antibiotics by general physicians and health-care workers at the primary level. But in our study， syphilis and chancroid showed a rising trend over the past few years， it may be due to increased trend of high-risk sexual behaviour and an increase in HIV infection. Which is in concordance with other studies. Sexually transmitted disease surveillance report formulated by the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-vention (CDC) in 2016 also showed a 17.6% increase in syphilis cases compared with 2015 and a 74.0% increase compared with2012. A similar rising trend was also seen in China， Europe and other countries\n\n【19】A significant rise in STIs in the elderly can be attributed to a change in immunity and weakening mucosal tissue， the ability to maintain sexual function longer with pharmaceutical assistance，increased divorce rates and no or infrequent use of a condom\n\n【20】Viral STIs were more common due to greater infectivity， the persistent and recurrent nature of viral infection Sexually transmitted infections enhance the susceptibility of an individ-ual to acquire or transmit HIV by affecting the integrity of cells； increasing the concentration of dendritic and CD4 cells， which facilitates HTV infection， replication and spread throughout the body and open sore can serve as a portal for HIV to enter the body. While non-ulcerative STIs increase the shedding of the HlV virus in the genital tract by recruiting HIV-infected inflam-matory cells.\n\n【21】Viral STIs were more common in HIV-positive patients. More CD4 T cells (2-37 times greater) appeared at the site of viral infection. Viral infection expressed a higher level of cell surface receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 that HIV uses to enter T cells. HIV replicates 3 to 5 times quickly in viral infection.\n\n【22】Herpes genitalis was the commonest STD found in associa-tion with HIV infection. HSV-2 enhance transmission of HIV through the disrupted epithelium， recruitment of HIV target cells and increased HIV viral load. Granuloma inguinale was found to be rare in this study. In addition， Lymphogranu-loma venereum was not found in this study.\n\n【23】Conclusion\n\n【24】Our study has tried to illustrate the pattern of sexually trans-mitted infections over 5 vears. The study had its limitations. The data were clinic based； they may not represent the whole population. We did not have detailed information about these patients' sexual behaviours， marital status and occupation. More studies are needed in this area， especially in central India， where stigma around sexually transmitted diseases is highly prevalent.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The etiology is usually multifactorial. It is most frequently caused by impaired potassium secretion， followed by transcellular potassium shifts and an increased potassium load.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A male newborn developed monomorphic ventricular tachycardia 2 hours after birth. He was born in the 35th week of gestation by urgent C-section following placental abruption. Laboratory results showed hemolytic anemia (Hb 99 g/L， Hct 0.31) with increased bilirubin levels and reticulocytosis， thrombocytopenia (39x10/L)， hypoglycemia (0.8 mmol/L)， and severe hyperkalemia (9.8 mmol/L). Umbilical artery blood gas analysis showed hypoxemia with acidosis (pO， 3.8 kPa， pH 7.21， pCO， 7.84 kPa， HCO， 23.3 mmol/L， BE -5 mmol/L). Creatinine(102 umol/L) and urea (9.8 mmol/L) were mildly elevated. Inflammatory markers were also increased (CRP26 mg/L， blood leukocyte count 24×10L). Early-onset sepsis， caused by Candida albicans， was confirmed ap-proximately 24 hours after birth. Non-invasive ventilation with 35-40%0， was necessary due to transient tachypnea. The neonate received a transfusion of packed red blood cells， a 10% glucose infusion， and empiri-cal antibiotic therapy. Hyperkalemia accompanied by arrhythmias was treated with calcium gluconate， insulin， Sorbisterit enema， and， finally， by exchange transfusion.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】We report a case of severe hyperkalemia in a newborn immediately after birth. Making a decision as early as possible regarding exchange transfusion is essential in patients with hyperkalemia with electrocardiogram changes and hemodynamic instability.\n\n【6】MeSH Keywords： Hyperkalemia· Intensive Care Units， Pediatric ·Neonatology·PediatricsThe serum potassium concentration is tightly maintained with-in the range of 3.5-5.0 mmol/L . The threshold may be con-siderably higher in neonates (up to 6.5 mmol/L)， especially if they are born prematurely . The serum potassium level is the concentration of potassium measurable in the extracel-lular space， where only 2% of potassium circulates. The oth-er 98% is distributed intracellularly， approximately 75% of it intramuscularly . Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disorder and is the most arrhythmogenic .\n\n【7】Hyperkalemia is usually caused by the concurrence of various factors： increased potassium intake， excretion disorders， and/or transcellular shifts . In neonates， inborn errors of metab-olism (congenital adrenal hyperplasia) are a leading cause of severe hyperkalemia . Hyperkalemia destabilizes myocar-dial conduction by decreasing the resting membrane potential， leading to increased cardiac depolarization and myocardial ex-citability . It can cause an spectrum of adverse ECG abnor-malities， from peaked T waves， beginning with levels above6.5 mmol/L， to shortened QT intervals， prolonged PR intervals， heart conduction blocks， depressed P waves， and wide QRS complexes， which tend to merge with the peaked T wave into'sine-wave'activity . Severe hyperkalemia (above 8 mmol/L) can precipitate fatal arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycar-dia and fibrillation， leading to asystole .\n\n【8】The standard treatment protocol for severe hyperkalemia in-cludes a combination of intravenous calcium chloride (or glu-conate) to antagonize the ECG changes， insulin to redistrib-ute the potassium into cells， sodium bicarbonate to reduce the metabolic acidosis， and oral (or rectal) sodium polystyrene sul-fonate (suspended in sorbitol) to bind and remove potassium through the gastrointestinal tract . Other treatment op-tions include potassium-eliminating loop diuretics (e.g.，furo-semide) when renal function is sufficient. Alternatively， potas-sium elimination by hemodialysis or exchange transfusion is recommended when other measures fail \n\n【9】Case Report\n\n【10】A male infant was delivered in the 35 h week of gestation by urgent C-section after placental abruption. This was the moth-er's second pregnancy and second delivery. The mother was 35years old at the time of delivery and her blood type was A RhD positive. Prenatal screenings for congenital infections revealed an old infection with Toxoplasma qondii. The indirect Coombs test was negative. The mother was treated with Euthyrox for Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The pregnancy was uncomplicated un-til the 35h week of gestation when the mother was hospital-ized due to a severe vaginal bleed that necessitated an urgentC-section. The baby’s birth weight was 3230 g， birth length51 cm， and head circumference 34 cm. After delivery， the male infant was pale， icteric， and bradycardic and had decreased muscle tone (Apgar score 5/9). A generalized petechial rash was observed. He was tachy-dyspneic， with increased work of breathing and an SpO， of 80% breathing air. To achieve ade-quate saturation， 35-40% 0， was needed. Non-invasive venti-lation (nasal continuous positive airway pressure-CPAP) was necessary for 2 days due to transient tachypnea. Immediately after birth， the neonate was transferred to the neonatal ward. Laboratory tests revealed anemia (Hb 99 g/L， Hct 0.31)，throm-bocytopenia (39x10/L)， hypoglycemia (0.8 mmol/L)， and severe hyperkalemia (>9 mmol/L). To correct the anemia， a concen-trated erythrocyte transfusion was given (35 ml of A positive RhD positive blood). Due to hypoglycemia， a bolus of 10%glucose was administered， followed by a continuous infusion of 10% glucose. After transfusion， the neonate's breathing and circulation stabilized and blood glucose levels increased. A mild tremor was occasionally observed， but he did not have any convulsions.\n\n【11】Due to his poor physical appearance，the neonate was trans-ferred to the intensive care unit， where monomorphic ven-tricular tachycardia was recorded on the ECG. A blood sample from the umbilical vein again showed severe hyperkalemia(9.8 mmol/L). Calcium gluconate， sodium bicarbonate， rapid-acting insulin， and a Sorbisterit rectal enema were adminis-tered. Due to the persistently elevated levels of potassium， an exchange transfusion was performed， after which the po-tassium levels normalized.\n\n【12】Other laboratory values were also abnormal： CRP was increased(26 mg/L)， with leukocyte count still within the normal range for newborns (24x10/L). Blood cultures were performed， and intravenous antibiotic therapy was started with ampicillin，gen-tamicin， and cefotaxime. All 3 antibiotics were discontinued after 5 days， when hemocultures and lumbar puncture sam-ple were confirmed negative for bacterial growth. However， Candida albicans was isolated from the blood cultures， so treat-ment with fluconazole was initiated approximately 24 hours after birth and terminated after 7 days， when control blood cultures were negative. All subsequent blood cultures were negative， and the levels of inflammatory markers decreased.\n\n【13】Along with persistent anemia (Hb 96 g/L， Hct 0.32 on the sec-ond day)， a marked reticulocytosis (reticulocyte percentage20%， reticulocyte count 735×10°/L) was also noted on day 10. Hyperbilirubinemia was present (serum bilirubin 304 pmol/L24 hours after exchange transfusion). Due to severe thrombo-cytopenia (lowest platelet count 9x10/L， the average around40×10°/L in the first week of life)， he also received multiple platelet transfusions during hospitalization.\n\n【14】Kidney function on the first day of life revealed elevated blood creatinine (102 pmol/L) and urea (9.8 mmol/L). The mean se-rum creatinine values in healthy newborn population studies were found to be around 55 umol/L on day 1， with the high-est values around 90 umol/L (97h percentile) . Renal fail-ure is indicated by serum creatinine levels higher than 15 mg/L(133 pmol/L) . Adrenal gland insufficiency was excluded because our patient had an isolated high serum potassium level immediately after birth， without any additional electro-lyte imbalance.\n\n【15】Umbilical artery blood gas analysis showed hypoxia with mild acidosis (pH 7.21， pO， 3.8 kPa， pCO， 7.84 kPa， HCO23.3 mmol/L， BE -5 mmol/L). Venous blood gas analysis af-ter non-invasive ventilation and transfusion showed per-sisting acidosis (pH 7.24， pCO， 6.6 kPa， HCO， 20.6 mmol/L， BE -6.8 mmol/L) with a pO， of 5.1 kPa and a mildly elevated lactate concentration (2.8 mmol/L).\n\n【16】Direct hyperbilirubinemia was present (219 pmol/L on the second day) and liver enzymes were elevated (ALT 7.2 pkat/L and AST 15.2 pkat/L， gamma-GT normal). Metabolic tests， per-formed to evaluate the direct hyperbilirubinemia， showed that plasma amino acids and acylcarnitine were within the normal range. Screening for organic acids in the urine found metabo-lites that could be explained by kidney or liver immaturity or liver damage. Due to persistently increased levels of bilirubin and liver enzymes， the neonate was followed up by a pedi-atric gastroenterologist and was treated with ursodeoxycho-lic acid up to 3.5 months of age， when the levels of liver en-zymes and bilirubin normalized.\n\n【17】Heart ultrasound showed interventricular septal and right ven-tricular hypertrophy and a restrictive ventricular muscular de fect， which was considered to be hemodynamically insignifi-cant. Head ultrasound showed calcified blood vessels in the basal ganglia. The electroencephalogram was normal. Thoracic X-ray and abdominal ultrasound showed no anomalies.During hospitalization， bilateral congenital cataracts were diagnosed， without other ocular malformations. Surgery on both eyes was indicated at the age of approximately 1 year and 10 months.\n\n【18】The hemoglobin level was persistently decreased (78-98 g/L， Hct 0.23-0.35) during hospitalization and after discharge. Marked reticulocytosis (reticulocyte percentage up to 47%，retic-ulocyte count 1456×10°/L) persisted at later outpatient visits. Thrombocytopenia did not reoccur. Mild hyperkalemia (up to6 mmol/L) was detected at control visits. Severe hyperkalemia and arrhythmias did not reoccur. The peripheral blood smear showed moderate anisocytosis and poikilocytosis.Immune he-molytic anemias were excluded， glucose-6-phosphate dehy-drogenase mutation was not identified， and the EMA (Eosin-5-maleimide binding) test for hereditary spherocytosis wasnegative. The etiology of the recurrent hemolytic episodes re-mained unknown.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】We report an interesting clinical case of a newborn with se vere hyperkalemia that led to a life-threatening arrhythmia. Such severe hyperkalemia is rarely seen in newborns， espe-cially immediately after birth. Since the newborn had multiple complications during delivery， we hypothesize that the cause of the severe hyperkalemia was multifactorial. Below， we dis-cuss the most probable contributing factors.\n\n【21】Hemolysis\n\n【22】The baby had a low Hb (99 g/L) after birth， and anemia was constantly present during follow-up， despite repeated transfu-sions. Increased bilirubin levels， reticulocytosis， and blood smear findings led to a diagnosis of hemolytic anemia. Hemolysis was therefore the most obvious and probable cause of hyperka-lemia， but the etiology of hemolysis remained unidentified. Both the mother and child had the same blood group (A， RhD positive)， and indirect and direct Coombs tests were negative， which excluded immune hemolytic anemia. Erythrocyte en-zyme deficiencies and membranopathies were also excluded. Recently， a blood sample for the RNA isolation and additional diagnostics of possible glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency was collected.\n\n【23】It is unusual for hemolysis alone to cause such a significant in-crease in the serum potassium concentration. It is difficult to determine the impact of hemolysis on the serum potassium level. Some articles have mentioned that even small extracel-lular potassium shifts (1% of the intracellular potassium) can cause severe hyperkalemia . Goyal and Schmotzer stud-ied the degree of hemolys is (HI， hemolytic index) and its con-tribution to elevation of the serum potassium concentration. They showed that the highest levels of hemolysis (HI grade 7， free Hb 0.5-1 g/L) can cause serum potassium concentrations of 8-9 mmol/L Unfortunately， the Hl could not be determined in our case since it is defined by the concentration of free Hb in the serum. Free Hb is not as specific for hemolysis in neo-nates compared to older children and adults， therefore the lev-els of free Hb were not checked in any of the blood samples.\n\n【24】The reticulocyte count is thought to be significantly corre-lated with the degree of hemolysis when erythrocyte surviv-al is less than 11 days (severe hemolysis) . In a study by Fehr et al. ， patients with severe hemolysis had reticulo-cyte counts from 188x10°/L to 1030x10/L In our case， the reticulocyte count was 735x10°/L on day 10 and it peaked at1456×10°/L during outpatient follow-up. Such a high degreeof hemolysis could probably cause severe hyperkalemia， but it is evident that severe hemolysis was also present through-out the patient's hospitalization and follow-up， without any recurrence of severe hyperkalemia， even when the reticulo-cyte count peaked at the age of 3 months (1456x10/L， 47%). Therefore， we believe that there were other cofactors after birth that contributed to hyperkalemia.\n\n【25】Hypoxemia and acidosis\n\n【26】Acidosis can cause an extracellular shift of potassium (due to hydrogen ion exchange). However， there is an inconsis-tent response to respiratory acidosis and a limited response to organic acidosis (i.e.， lactic acidosis)， as organic acids tend to move across membranes with the hydrogen ion . Hyperkalemia can be caused by mineral acidosis ， which was not present in our case.\n\n【27】Non-oliguric hyperkalemia has been defined as a serum potas-sium of 7 mmol/L during the first 72 hours of life in the pres-ence of a urinary output of >1 mL/kg/h . The incidence of non-oliguric hyperkalemia is high in preterm infants (up to52%) . This may partly be due to a shift of potassium from the intracellular space to the extracellular space associ-ated with immature functioning of Na/K ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate)ase activity . Non-oliguric hyperkalemia due to Na/K ATPase pump immaturity was unlikely in our case， since it is almost exclusively present in extremely preterm in-fants， and potassium levels usually rise in the first 24 hours after birth .\n\n【28】Some animal studies have found that an increase in serum potassium is correlated with the severity of the ischemic in-sult . Several authors have investigated the rise in serum potassium during ischemic events (e.g.， cardiac arrest， sepsis， hypoperfusion states， and hemorrhagic shock) and suggestedthat Na/K ATPase is inhibited due to hypoxia， which decreases the influx of potassium . Other researchers have sug-gested that ATP-sensitive potassium channel activation is the main mechanism through which the efflux of potassium causes hyperkalemia during muscle cell ischemia. ATP-sensitive po-tassium channels are found in many tissues， including skeletal muscle cells， red blood cells， pancreatic cells， and nonvascu-lar and vascular smooth muscle cells. These channels are in-creasingly activated when the cellular ATP/adenosine diphos-phate ratio is decreased， as seen in hypoxic conditions .\n\n【29】Our patient suffered hypoxia due to placental abruption. At birth， secondary apnea was present and non-invasive ven-tilation was necessary to initiate breathing. Umbilical artery blood gas analysis showed hypoxia with acidosis (pO， 3.8 kPa， pH 7.21， pCO， 7.84 kPa， HCO， 23.3 mmol/L). Perinatal hypoxia might have partially contributed to hyperkalemia in our patient.\n\n【30】Conclusions\n\n【31】We report a case of severe hyperkalemia in a newborn imme-diately after birth. It is essential to make a decision as early as possible regarding exchange transfusion in a patient with hyperkalemia with electrocardiogram changes and hemody-namic instability.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

This report is of a 27-year-old woman diagnosed with tuberculous spondylitis， or Pott disease， during pregnancy. A 27-year-old female， in her first pregnancy and at 29 weeks of gestation， presented to the Emergency Department with worsening severe neck and back pain for the past 5 months. Post-gadolinium contrast T1-weighted dif-fusion magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated multiple soft tissue spinal lesions (T2-T4). Computed to-mography-guided biopsy showed a central caseous necrosis enclosed by a granuloma containing a wide array of cells comprising epithelioid cells， Langhans giant cells， lymphocytes， and plasma cells. ZiehNeelsen stain-ing was positive for acid-fast bacilli. The final diagnosis was consistent with Pott disease. The patient received anti-tuberculosis medications， her symptoms improved over time， and she delivered vaginally at term. At a16-month follow-up， her symptoms had improved， and she returned to her normal daily activities. There wereno complications arising from the use of gadolinium contrast in the mother or toddler.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】This report has highlighted the importance of imaging of the spine in the diagnosis of causes of severe back pain. This rare presentation of Pott disease in pregnancy has shown the challenges in diagnosis and the im-portance of a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis and management so that treatment protects both the mother and fetus.\n\n【5】Keywords： Magnetic Resonance Imaging · Mycobacterium tuberculosis subsp. tuberculosis· Pregnancy OutcomeTuberculosis (TB) is one of the oldest known infectious diseases and it persists as a chief source of substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide . Around 25% to 33% of the worldwide population has latent TB， according to the World Health Organization . The true incidence of TB in pregnancy is unknown， owing to multiple confounding factors . Tuberculous spondylitis， also known as Pott disease， is clinically defined by the presence of extrapulmo-nary TB that involves the spine and is secondary to blood-borne extension of TB from other bodily regions， mostly the lungs . Patients with Pott disease typically present with vertebra. body os-teomyelitis and intervertebral discitis arising from TB infection . In pregnancy， active TB disease should be eliminated prior to de-livery . The diagnosis of active TB during pregnancy should be treated with the typical 4 first-line agents， namely isoniazid， ri-fampin，ethambutol， and pyrazinamide . All of these agents are classified as pregnancy category C. Notably， owing to a lack of safety evidence， the use of pyrazinamide during pregnancy is de-batable . Nevertheless， pyrazinamide is indicated for pregnant women who have severe active TB disease， extrapulmonary TB， or HIV co-infection . The treatment duration for active TB dur-ing pregnancy is 9 months and should be managed by an infec-tious disease specialist.Although treatment for latent TB is not warranted for most women during pregnancy， all pregnant wom-en with latent TB require close surveillance . Prompt treatment of active TB during the course of pregnancy significantly impacts the prognosis. A meta-analysis of 13 studies by Sobhy et al re-vealed that maternal (eg， anemia and cesarean delivery) and fetal(eg， perinatal demise，preterm birth， and low birthweight) compli-cations were lower in pregnant women with active TB who initi-ated TB therapy in the first trimester than in those who initiat-ed active TB therapy later in the second and third trimesters . In a prospective cohort study， van der Water et al reported high(96.6%， n=28/29) success treatment rates (cure rates) for preg-nant women， regardless of TB drug-susceptibility. Pott disease is exceedingly rare in pregnancy and represents an exception-al clinical dilemma， with very few published case reports . This report is of a 27-year-old woman diagnosed with tubercu-lous spondylitis， or Pott disease， during pregnancy and describes the challenges in diagnosis and management.\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】A 27-year-old woman in her first pregnancy presented to our hospital at 29 weeks of gestation with a gradually progressive severe back and neck pain for 5 months， which was associat-ed with numbness in the upper limbs. She also had nausea and vomiting. These symptoms started before pregnancy and wors-ened while she was in our Emergency Department. She did not have routine antenatal follow-up， but her pregnancy was uncom-plicated. She denied any history of trauma or other neurologicalsymptoms， gastrointestinal symptoms， urinary symptoms， colicky pain， and fainting episodes. She had no prior history of allergies， diseases， or surgeries. She denied taking any prescribed or over-the-counter medications. Her family history was unremarkable.\n\n【8】The body mass index was 33 kg/m； her body weight and height measured 85.2 kg and 160 cm， respectively. On general exam-ination， there were no features of jaundice or anemia. Her vi-tal signs showed no fever， blood pressure of 115/72 mmHg， pulse of 75 beats/min； and respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min.\n\n【9】A head and neck examination revealed tenderness at the cer-vical and thoracic spine， with limited movement. There was no lymphadenopathy and the respiratory and cardiovascular ex-aminations were unremarkable. On neurological examination， power， tone， and reflexes appeared normal in the upper and lower limbs bilaterally. The bladder and bowel functions were intact. The abdominal examination revealed the fundal level at30 weeks， cephalic presentation， and positive fetal heart sounds.\n\n【10】The routine laboratory test results and urine analysis were within the normal limits except for a raised erythrocyte sed-imentation rate of 120 mm/h. An obstetric ultrasound exam-ination showed a single viable fetus， cephalic presentation， and an estimated fetal weight around 1301 g. There were no gross anomalies seen. Post-gadolinium contrast T1-weighted diffusion MRI of the brain and spine showed a large soft tis-sue at the level of T2， T3， and T4 measuring 3.4x5.0×5.4 cm in the transverse， anteroposterior， and craniocaudal dimen-sions， respectively . The soft tissue component had paraspinal and intraspinal components， causing mild spinal canal stenosis with a mild mass-occupying effect on the spi-nal cord without evidence of cord myelopathy. The brain study was unremarkable.\n\n【11】A multidisciplinary approach with maternal-fetal medicine， neurosurgery， neonatology， and radiology was done. The dif-ferential diagnosis with a higher likelihood included pyogen-ic spondylitis and tuberculous spondylitis， whereas the dif-ferential diagnosis with a lower likelihood included multiple myeloma， lymphoma， and metastatic spinal foci. A comput-ed tomography-guided biopsy was obtained from the mass and sent for histopathological analysis. Histopathological ex-amination revealed a central caseous necrosis enclosed by a granuloma containing a wide array of cells comprising epi-thelioid cells， Langhans giant cells， lymphocytes， and plasma cells. Ziehl-Neelsen staining showed positive acid-fast bacil-li. The histopathological picture was consistent with tubercu-lous spondylitis (Pott disease). The patient was started on 4typical anti-TB drugs， isoniazid 300 mg， rifampin 450 mg， pyr-azinamide 1500 mg， and ethambutol 800 mg. Moreover， vi-tamin B6 (pyridoxine) 50 mg was initiated daily. During her follow-up visits， she showed gradual improvement in motorpower and less use of analgesic medications， with no signs of adverse effects. Spontaneous labor commenced at 38 weeks， and she progressed normally to deliver vaginally. A baby boy with a birth weight of 2.76 kg at the thirteenth percentile of estimated birth weight was delivered. Placental histopathol-ogy was unremarkable，and Mycobacterium tuberculosis bac-terium was not detected in cultures taken from the placenta.\n\n【12】After delivery， an MRI of the spine showed significant reduc-tion of the lesion by 90% and improvement in the osteomyeli-tis. She continued anti-TB therapy for 12 months， with follow-up at the infectious diseases clinic. At her 16-month follow-up， her symptoms had improved and she returned to her normal daily activities. There were no complications arising from the gadolinium contrast use in the mother or toddler.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Pott disease presents a diagnostic dilemma because of the relative infrequency of occurrence during pregnancy . Apossible differential diagnosis of Pott disease should be con-sidered when pregnant patients present with neck and back pain. MRI (without gadolinium contrast)  and biopsy play important roles in the diagnosis of spinal TB in pregnancy. A multidisciplinary approach and anti-TB drugs can be consid-ered with a careful workup， because of the possible risks for both the fetus and mother.\n\n【15】TB of the spine during pregnancy is rare . Pain involv-ing the neck and back in pregnant women should not be au-tomatically regarded as benign， and delayed diagnosis and treatment of Pott disease during pregnancy can negatively culminate in adverse complications . The related obstetric sequelae that have been documented in pregnancy with Pott disease include higher rates of spontaneous abortion， preterm labor， and increased neonatal mortality . Several consti-tutional symptoms can take place gradually over an interval of weeks or months， such as persistent fever， night sweats， loss of appetite， and fatigue . Nevertheless， close to 50% to66% of pregnant women with TB are symptom-free because they have latent infection . Nonspecific constitutional symptoms during pregnancy can phenocopy the physiologi-cal modifications that normally occur during pregnancy . The symptoms of Pott disease can become obvious when the neural conduction within the spinal cord is interrupted .\n\n【16】Kaul et al reported the case of Pott disease in a 22-vear-old pregnant woman who presented with poor lower limb mobil-ity during her second trimester .MRI showed a T2 lesion that was highly suspicious for spinal tuberculosis. In view of her progressive neurological disease， the patient under-went antepartum surgical decompression of Pott paraplegia， while maintaining her pregnancy during the second trimes-ter. Postoperative biopsy confirmed Pott disease， and she was started on an anti-TB regimen. She delivered a healthy baby girl at 36 weeks of gestation by cesarean delivery. At 14 weeks after delivery， the patient recovered uneventfully without ad-verse events. Moreover， Srivastava et al reported the case of Pott disease in a 26-year-old pregnant woman during her sec-ond trimester who presented with acute spastic paraplegia in-cluding sphincter dysfunction . Plain X-ray with abdomi-nal shielding and MRI depicted a lesion at T5 that was highly suggestive of tuberculous spondylitis. Owing to the severity of the paraplegia and autonomic dysfunction， the patient un-derwent surgical decompression， and her neurological func-tion was recovered. Nevertheless， the fetus experienced intra-uterine demise 4 weeks after surgery. In the present case，the main symptoms were severe neck and back pain without para-plegia. In line with the recommendations reported in 2003 by the Infectious Disease Society of America， the United States Centers for Disease Control， and Prevention and the American Thoracic Society， a 4-drug protocol should be employed em-pirically to treat Pott disease . Our patient was successfullytreated with anti-TB therapy without any toxicity to the moth-er or fetus. Her symptoms completely subsided over time and she delivered vaginally at term without eventful outcomes.\n\n【17】The challenge in our patient was the soft tissue spinal mass which was identified through MRI. The differential diagnosis of a spinal mass mimicking a malignant tumor was not high ly assumed. This was because the involvement of 3 consecu-tive thoracic vertebrae with intervertebral disc prompted us to highly consider a differential diagnosis of spinal pyogenic osteomyelitis or tuberculous spondylitis. At the MRI level， sev-eral imaging parameters can highly differentiate between tu-berculous spondylitis (Pott disease) and pyogenic spondylitis. Compared with pyogenic spondylitis， tuberculous spondylitis has higher rates of a well-defined paraspinal abnormal signal， thin and smooth abscess wall， occurrence of paraspinal or in-traosseous abscess with rim enhancement， engagement of23 vertebral levels， more likelihood of thoracic spine engage-ment， and hyperintense signal on T2-weighted diffusion imag-es . A multidisciplinary approach was obtained and biop-sy taken by interventional radiologist-confirmed Pott disease.\n\n【18】MRI plays an important role in the diagnosis of spinal TB in pregnancy. A recent study showed that there was no signifi-cant difference between the contrast and non-contrast MRlin diagnosing Pott disease， and concluded that both techniques were equally effective . In our study， we used post-gadolin-ium contrast T1-weighted imaging. However， T2-weighted dif-fusion imaging with a fat-suppression technique or short tau inversion recovery could have been sufficient for the diagnosis of Pott disease. This is because Pott disease is characterized by intrinsically hyperintense signals on T2-weighted diffusionimages . There is limited and inconclusive information on the safety of gadolinium-based contrasts on the fetus dur-ing pregnancy . The use of gadolinium-based contrasts may be linked to concerns about neonatal death and several ad-verse events， but without certainty . Hence， according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists， the general guideline is that gadolinium-based contrasts are not absolutely contradicted during pregnancy； however， they should only be used when the benefits outweigh the risks dur-ing pregnancy . Moreover， the use of gadolinium-enhanced MRI during pregnancy should not suppress breastfeeding \n\n【19】Conclusions\n\n【20】This report has highlighted how impoitant imaging of the spine can be in the diagnosis of causes of severe back pain. This rare presentation of Pott disease in pregnancy has shown the challenges in diagnosis and the importance of a multidisci-plinary approach to diagnosis and management so that treat-ment protects both the mother and fetus.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Patients with this rare variant of GBS usually present with limb numbness， followed by bilateral facial nerve palsy . However， an even more rare variant of GBS also in-cludes facial hemiplegia， which may mimic Bell’s palsy .\n\n【2】This report is of a case of a rare variant of GBS consisting of facial diplegia and paresthesia with left facial hemiplegia that was associated with IgG antibodies to galactocerebroside and phosphatidic acid.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 54-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with pares-thesia of his extremities and a left facial palsy. Two days be-fore hospital admission， he developed a left facial palsy. Two weeks before hospital admission，he had an upper respiratory tract infection. Six days before hospital admission， he devel-oped paresthesia of the extremities. Four days before hospital admission， the patient had visited a hospital near to his office.\n\n【5】The patient had no history of medical diseases， operations， use of medications， or previous hospitalization. He was an ex-smoker until ten years before hospital admission， when he smoked up to twelve cigarettes a day. He regularly consumed350 mL of beer per day.\n\n【6】On physical examination， he was alert， and his general appear-ance， cardiovascular and respiratory system were normal. His lower abdomen was non-distended and anal sphincter tone was normal. His temperature of 36.5℃， his blood pressure was 165/126 mmHg， his heart rate was 78 beats per minute， and his oxygen saturation was 99% breathing ambient room air. Neurological examination showed a left-sided facial palsy. The rest of the cranial nerve examination was nor-mal. His peripheral neurological examination showed normal tone of his extremities， and manual muscle testing was 5/5 bi-laterally throughout. However， patellar and Achilles deep ten-don reflexes were reduced， but other reflexes were normal. Cutaneous nociception， thermosensation， and vibratory sen-sation in his extremities were also reduced . Other neurological examinations were normal.\n\n【7】On admission， a non-contrast head computed tomography(CT) scan and nerve conduction velocity studies of his extrem-ities were undertaken， both of which showed no abnormali-ties. Chest X-ray was normal. A non-contrast brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRl) scan for central neurological disease， showed no abnormality.\n\n【8】Laboratory investigations showed peripheral blood leukocytes of 7，700/pL， hemoglobin of 16.2 g/dL platelets of 170，000/pL total protein of 7.5 g/dL， albumin of 4.9 g/dL， creatinine of 1.1mg/dL， C-reactive protein of 0.05 mg/dL， and hemoglobin A1c of 5.6%. A urinalysis revealed no protein， leukocytes or eryth-rocytes. A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed a to-tal leukocyte count of 16/pL， which was monocyte-predom-inant (11/uL monocytes； 5/uL polymorphonuclear cells)，and protein of 71.7 mg/dL (normal range； 10-40 mg/dL).\n\n【9】On the second day after his admission， treatment with oral prednisolone 60 mg/day， valacyclovir 1，000 mg/day， and meth-ylcobalamin (Vitamin B12) 1，500 pg/day were initiated due to a possible diagnosis of Bell's palsy. However， his neurological symptoms persisted.\n\n【10】On the fourth day following hospital admission， repeated ex-amination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed a total leu-kocyte count of 9/pL， which was monocyte-predominant (9/pL monocytes； 0/pL polymorphonucleocytes) and protein of 82.7mg/dL (normal range；10-40mg/dL). On the fifth day following hospital admission， a nerve conduction study revealed mildly prolonged distal motor latencies and mildly reduced distal mo-tor amplitude with poor responses in both of his legs . Bilateral sural nerves also showed markedly reduced sensory nerve action potentials . These results were consis-tent with demyelination and excluded Bell’s palsy. Therefore， on the eighth day after admission， pooled intravenous immu-noglobulin (NIG) treatment was also commenced on suspicion of a diagnosis of a variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) for his left facial palsy and peripheral nerve signs.\n\n【11】Two weeks after admission， his abnormal sensations had im-proved. At the beginning of the admission， his blood pressure was elevated to 180/130 mmHg， and which decreased to ap-proximately 140/90 mmHg after initiation of the IVIG treat-ment. He was discharged on the 18th hospital day. His left facial palsy gradually recovered and was almost back to a premorbid state by five months after the onset of his symp-toms .\n\n【12】To identify the potential cause of his neurological illness， further tests were undertaken. Blood and CSF culture were negative. Stool culture was not performed. A cytological ex-amination of the CSF showed few lymphocytes without ma-lignant cells. Vitamin B12 level was normal (891 pg/mL； nor-mal range， 249-938 pg/mL). Human immunodeficiency virus(HIV) 1 and 2 antibodies were negative and Mycoplasma lgG antibody was negative (particle agglutination test). Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) IgM antibody was negative， but EBV IgG an-tibody was 80 times (normal range， 0-10 times)， EBV nuclear antigen was 40 times (normal range， 0-10 times) indicating previous infection. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgM was negative，\n\n【13】Table 1.

IgG to phospholipid acid， and IgM antibodies to glycolipids(GM1，GM2， GM3a，GD1a， GD1b， G3， GT1b， GQ1b，galactocer-ebroside， and GalNAc-GD1a) were analyzed. In addition， se-rum lgG to glycolipids Gd1a/Gd1b was assessed. IgG antibod-ies to galactocerebroside and phosphatidic acid were positive， but the rest of the anti-glycolipid antibodies were negative.\n\n【18】This case report is of a rare variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome(GBS)， consisting of facial diplegia and paresthesia with left facial hemiplegia that was associated with IgG antibodies to galactocerebroside and phosphatidic acid.\n\n【19】On initial presentation， the patient's symptoms were diag nosed either as a variant of GBS or as left unilateral Bell’'s pal-sy. This patient had a respiratory tract infection that preced-ed his neurological symptoms. The symptoms of paresthesia in his extremities were associated with decreased deep ten-don reflexes， and sensory disturbance on physical examina-tion. Increased protein levels and a decreased cell count in the CSF were consistent with a diagnosis of a variant of GBS， with facial palsy and sensory disturbance.\n\n【20】GBS is known to be a post-infectious polyneuropathy character-ized by acute lower limb weakness ， but in between 24-60%of cases， patients may develop facial nerve palsy . In 1994Ropper， for the first time， described a new variant of GBS with features of facial diplegia， limb paresthesia， decreased deep ten-don reflexes， an elevation in CSF protein (>0.55 g/L) but with-out an increase in white blood cells in more than 75% of cas-es， and demyelination on nerve conduction studies， as facial diplegia and paresthesia . Most patients with facial diple-gia and paresthesia initially present with limb numbness， fol-lowed by bilateral facial nerve palsy . Almost all patients have antecedent infection within four weeks prior to the onset of neurological symptoms and many patients have demyelination findings in their limbs on nerve conduction investigations .\n\n【21】Anti-GM2 ganglioside antibodies are commonly， but not always， detected in GBS . The variant of GBS with facial diplegia and paresthesia sometimes occurs unilaterally and then subsequently becomes bilateral . Thus， it can be difficult to diagnose vari-ant GBS with facial diplegia and paresthesia and to distinguish it from Bell's palsy. Facial palsy in this variant of GBS is usually bilateral， but it may be asymmetrical and is uncommonly uni-lateral . In our patient， the clinical presentation of GBS was a rare cause of facial hemiplegia and it is possible that the pa-tient's history of hypertension may have been caused by this variant of GBS， as hypertension is a recognized comorbid con-dition in GBS and in this patient， hypertension reduced after treatment . However， hypertension has been rarely reported in patients with the GBS with facial diplegia and paresthesia .\n\n【22】GBS is associated with a history of infection， including\n\n【23】Campylobacter jejuni， influenza， Mycoplasma pneumoniae，\n\n【24】Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)， and other pathogens . In this pa-tient， a positive serum anti-galactocerebroside antibody sug-gested a preceding history of Mycoplasma infection . Among patients with variant GBS with facial diplegia andparesthesia， an upper respiratory infection is a common pre-ceding infection and anti-CMV antibodies are frequently posi-tive . In our case， the patient had a preceding viral upper respiratory tract infection， which was supported by the nega-tive culture studies for bacterial pathogens.\n\n【25】In patients with variant GBS with facial diplegia and paresthe-sia， there have been a few cases reported with positive anti-glycolipid antibodies . However， in this case， the potential effects of antibodies to galactocerebroside and phosphatidic acid may be useful as a diagnostic marker for variant GBS， but this requires further study. In particular， antibodies to GM1， GQ1b，GM1b， GD1a， GalNAc-GD1a，LM1， and galactocerebro-side are specific for GBS . Also， antibodies of GD1a/GD1b， GD1b/GT1b， and GM1/GalNAc-GD1a are also associated with GBS . Among the proteins eliciting an antibody response in GBS， galactocerebroside is a major glycolipid antigen that is present in myelin， and antibodies to galactocerebroside may have a role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune demyelinating neuropathies including GBS .Anti-glycolipid antibod-ies in variant GBS with facial diplegia and paresthesia such as， anti-GM2 antibody have been reported to be positive in a few patients ， but most patients with the disease have no specif-ic anti-glycolipid antibodies detected. In previous studies， the detection of antibodies to phosphatidic acid in combination with anti-glycolipid antibodies was more useful for the diag-nosis of GBS . To the best of our knowledge， there has been no report of serum immunological investigations of an-tibodies to galactocerebroside and phosphatidic acid patients with GBS， including the variant with facial diplegia and pares-thesia. However， because assays for antibodies to galactocere-broside and phosphatidic acid are not commercially available and need to be done in specialized referral laboratories， these immunological tests are not commonly available at present.\n\n【26】Therefore， assays for antibodies to galactocerebroside and phosphatidic acid should be considered as an additional test that may help to confirm variant GBS with facial diplegia and paresthesia. Treatment of patients with variant GBS with facial diplegia and paresthesia remains controversial . Patients with GBS may be treated with plasmapheresis or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) . However， treatment is not always needed if the patient remains mobile one week after the initial onset of symptoms j. Almost all patients reported with variant GBS with facial diplegia and paresthesia have pre-served mobility throughout the duration of their illness .\n\n【27】Glucocorticoid treatment has been also reported and found to be variably effective in patients with this rare variant of GBS ， while patients with IgM antibodies to N-acetylgalactosaminyl GD1a (GalNAc-GD1a) and other gangliosides have responded to glucocorticoids . Therefore， glucocorticoids may be useful for improvement of facial palsy in cases of GBS withfacial diplegia and paresthesia， the action of which is thought to be due to its anti-inflammatory effects， and reduction of edema . In the present case， because the symptoms were initially similar to those of Bell’s palsy， the patient was ini-tially prescribed oral prednisolone， valacyclovir， and vitamin B12 ， which was followed by IVIG treatment for his persistent facial palsy . Five months after his presen-tation， the patient had almost returned to normal . However， it is not clear whether this improvement was due to glucocorticoids，and/or IIG treatment， or that the symptoms could have improved spontaneously.\n\n【28】Conclusions\n\n【29】Variant Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) with facial diplegia and paresthesia is a rare manifestation， that occasionally presentswith facial hemiplegia， and which may mimic the more com-mon Bell’s palsy. For the diagnosis of future cases， detection of antibodies to galactocerebroside and phosphatidic acid may assist in differentiating the disease from other pathologies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Here， we report the case of a cerebral palsy patient who received intravenous platelet-rich plasma.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】We administered an intravenous injection of concentrated platelet-rich plasma (25 cc) in a 6-year-old boy with perinatal cerebral palsy， cognitive impairment， and marked and severe generalized spasticity We performed follow-up at 3 and 6 months after the injection. All serum samples for determination were obtained by ELISA technique. Cognitive scales (Bayley， Battelle， M.S.CA， Kaufman ABC， and Stanford-Binet Intelligence scale) were used before and after treatment. The determination protocol that was applied before the analysis was per-formed manually and the autotransfusion was considered suitable for treatment. We determined the plasma levels of factor similar to insulin-1 (IGF-1)， platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)， vasculo-endothelial growth factor (VEGF)， and transforming growth factor B (TGF-B) before and during treatment monitoring.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】No adverse effects were observed in the patient except for a small hematoma in the area channeling venous access. We observed a clear improvement in the cognitive sphere (memory， ability to perform more complex tasks， and acquisition of new skills) and in language， maintaining stable levels of growth factor in plasma 3-5times higher than average for his age group at both 3-and 6-month follow-up. Positron emission tomography(PET) images showed an evident increased demarcation in the cerebral cortex. We propose that this therapy is useful in these patients to harness the neurostimulative and neuroregenerative power of endogenous growth factors derived from platelets.\n\n【6】MeSH Keywords： Cerebral Palsy ·Insulin-Like Growth Factorl· Neuronal Plasticity· Platelet-Derived Growth Factor·Platelet-Rich Plasma · Transforming Growth Factors\n\n【7】The use of platelet-rich plasma in various fields of medicine and traumatology， dentistry， and general surgery is experi-encing an extraordinary development given the larger gen-eration capacity， chemotaxis， modulating angiogenesis， and cellular plasticity of injured tissues that produce growth fac-tors such as insulin growth factor type1 (IGF-1)， transforming growth factor B (TGF-B)， vasculo-endothelial-derived growth factor (VEGF)， and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)， which are the plasma growth and platelet factors that are most re-ported in the literature due to their power of neurostimula-tion and neuroregeneration. Regenerative medicine relies on the power of the cell to perform activation and differentia-tion， producing growth factors derived from platelets both lo-cally and systematically.\n\n【8】However，there are other fields of application in medicine that are opening new roads， such as neuroendocrinology and neu-rorehabilitation， which are now used either locally or system-ically in autologous transplantation， given the intrinsic acti-vating antiapoptotic pathways controlling the biochemical level of neuronal cells， which have specific receptors on their membranes for these growth factors derived from platelets. In addition， it has been demonstrated that in patients with neuronal degenerative diseases (e.g.，Alzheimer disease， vas-cular encephalopathy， multiple sclerosis， ALS， and hypoxic or anoxic encephalopathy)， proteins were detected at low levels in serum， as well as being modulated by mechanisms of ce-rebral hypoxia. Furthermore， a neuroprotective function has also been shown in neuronal tissue.\n\n【9】Case Report\n\n【10】We report the case of a 6-year-old boy diagnosed with cerebral palsy at age 2 months， secondary to perinatal hypoxia， withspastic tetraparesis and moderate cognitive impairment， who received a 25-cc intravenous infusion of PRP with clinical， lab-oratory， and radiological monitoring prior to infusion and at 3and 6 months later， without a clinical trial. Authorization for the treatment was provided by the patient's legal representatives. We obtained 60 cc of the patient's whole blood. After titration， we performed analytical biochemistry， determination of plasma growth factors， and complete blood count serology to ensure the suitability of the treatment. The technique for obtaining PRP used only 1 centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 30 min at 18℃.\n\n【11】Table 1 shows the cellular and protein values in peripheral blood of the patient and the final product obtained.\n\n【12】While the laboratory sample was processed， a 20-G venous access was created in the elbow flexure and we infused the RPP within 30 min of obtaining it， at the rate of 1 mL per s.\n\n【13】Before the injection and at 24 hours and 3 and 6 months after the injection， we determined plasma levels of serum growth factors by ELISA technique and leucocyte count. Values are shown in Figures 1 and 2.\n\n【14】Similarly， rigorous monitoring was performed for neuro-reha-bilitative skills acquired by the patient by 3 and 6 months af-ter treatment by applying cognitive scales (Bayley， Battelle， M.S.C.A， Kaufman ABC， and Stanford-Binet intelligence scale) and comparing the results with those obtained before treat-ment. We did PET brain imaging immediately before and at6 months after the injection. Images and report results are shown in Figure 3.\n\n【15】Clinical monitoring and analytical values of the obtained plate-let growth factors and imaging were satisfactory， obtaining a high peak in levels of plasmatic growth factors at 24 hours after the treatment， which remained stable at above-normal levels at 3 and 6 months after the injection. This resulted in aclearly progressive improvement of the patient’s symptoms， es-pecially in the cognitive sphere (e.g.，capacity to eat solid food， remarkable improvement in coordinated movements，speak-ing 2-and 3-syllable words， and fixing his gaze on moving ob-jects， evident at 3-month follow-up and maintaining progress at 6-month follow-up. Neuroradiological evaluation revealed a clear increase in glucose metabolism level in the entire cor-tex， suggestive of neuronal plasticity phenomena， and we didnot observe any changes in deep brain structures (hippocam-pus and amygdala).\n\n【16】Table 1.

However， scientific and social require-ments make it necessary to design appropriate clinical tri-als to establish treatment protocols in each particular medi-cal application .\n\n【20】Today， the medical areas with the most scientific evidence about the use of RPP are dentistry (for repairing dental alveolar bed) and traumatology (arthropathy， tendinopathy， ligament inju-ries， and meniscopathy)， with the design of randomized trials in phase l-II . But the empirical use in many diseases and medical specialties is based on weak scientific evidence .\n\n【21】Some of the most promising medical fields for application are neurology， neuroendocrinology， and neurorehabilitation. Neuroregenerative， antiapoptotic， immunomodulatory， and neu-rotropic effects differentiating platelet-derived growth factors in neuronal tissue makes this a totally feasible therapy treat-ment from the medical point of view， to be applied in neuro-degenerative or anoxic and hypoxic pathologies like Alzheimer disease， cerebral vascular accidents， spinal cord injury， and cerebral palsy of hypoxic or anoxic origin . Spontaneous remission of cerebral palsy signs is rare due to degenerative neuronal and glial mass secondary to hypoxic effects in the evolution of the disease .Neuroprotective and neuroregener-ation stimulator effects were observed in these patients man-aged with synthetic growth hormone (HGF)， which results in functional improvement， especially in the cognitive field (e.g.， memory， language， ability to perform complex tasks， and ac-quisition of new skills). In these patients， the neuronal degen-erative effect has been accompanied by a marked qualitative and quantitative decrease in plasmatic growth factors like HGF-IGF-1-VEGD， PDGF， and TGF-B ， regulated by the hypotha-lamic-pituitary axis that produces a neuroprotective effect， and by the neurotropic effect of chemotaxis， cell differentiation，and neuroplasticity on neuronal tissue. However， treatment with synthetic growth hormone is costly， not only from the economic standpoint， but also from the clinician's viewpoint. The possibility of RPP as a final product， rich in these growth factors， for local or systemic administration in a single dose， and maintenance of plasma levels stable enough for achieving a long-term therapeutic effect similar to clinical hormone syn-thetic growth， without the oncological secondary effects ， make it attractive for these patients by significantly reducing the economic and clinical cost of treatment.\n\n【22】Conclusions\n\n【23】We report the case of a patient with cerebral palsy， in whom the application of systemic PPR in a single dose increased the level of platelet-derived growth factors to above-normal lev-els and that remained stable over time (at 6-month clinical follow-up)， resulting in clinical improvement， especially in the cognitive sphere， coinciding with the results obtained by oth-er authors who used isolated growth factors in patients with perinatal hypoxia. This is the first case report published in the literature of use of autologous growth factors in this clinical application with successful results. Well-designed，random-ized， clinical trials are needed to further develop the utility of this treatment in these patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The family stated that the patient had been complaining of a headache for one to two months. The family noted some mild behavioral and cognitive changes that had progressed over the last month. The week prior to presentation to our facility， the patient had an episode of slurred speech， facial droap， drooling， and seizure-like activity in the left upper ex-tremity. The patient was taken to outlying emergency depart-ment (ED) but on arrival to the outside facility his symptoms had resolved. He was evaluated with basic labs anda non-con-trasted computed tomography (CT) of the brain. He was dis-charged from the outside ED with a prescription for naprosyn and doxycycline. Over the next week， he had further behav-ior changes and became very lethargic. The family brought the patient to our facility for further evaluation at this time. The patient had no known past medical history and no prior surgeries. Current medications included naprosyn and doxy-cycline that he had received one week prior， no other home medications. Social history was significant for alcohol misuse for 10 years， tobacco use of l pack per day for 10 years and oc-casional marijuana use. The patient had just recently moved back to Tennessee to seek help from his family in quitting al-cohol， after living in Texas and working as a bank teller for 7years. No known travel outside of the country and no known contact with persons with communicable diseases.On physi-cal exam he was well developed， well nourished，profoundly encephalopathic and diaphoretic. Temperature was 103F， heart rate 87 beats/min， blood pressure 154/84 mmHg， re-spiratory rate 16 /min， and oxygen saturation 99% RA. His cardiovascular， pulmonary， and abdominal exams where unre-markable， skin was notable for significant diaphoresis without rash. He was unable to follow commands for a full neurolog-ic exam but was confused and combative， moved all extrem-ities spontaneously and with equal strength， and did exhibit significant photophobia or nuchal rigidity.\n\n【10】Investigations\n\n【11】Initial laboratory data revealed leukocytosis of 11.7 th/mm3with 92% neutrophils otherwise hemoglobin， hematocrit， and complete metabolic panel where within normal limits. Cerebral spinal fluid evaluation revealed WBC count of 302/mm’ with 98% lymphocytes， glucose 14 mg/d1， protein 144mg/dl， and was clear in character. Chest x-ray and non-con-trast CT of head where without significant pathology. After blood cultures had been obtained and initial CSF studies sent， the patient was place in the neurologic intensive care unit and started on broad spectrum antibiotics with vanco-mycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Over the next twelve hours the patient was closely monitored and supportive care was continued as initial results began to return. Gram staining of CSF and blood was negative for bacteria and HIV， RPR， Cryptococcal antigen， HSV PCR where negative. The patient showed minimal mental status improvement within the first 24 hours and an MRI of the brain and Neurologicconsult where obtained. MRI with and without contrast re vealed right basilar meningeal enhancement with an acute right basil ganglia infarction . Given the char-acteristic finding of the CSF and MRI a PPD was placed and Infectious disease was consulted. PPD was read as negative at48 hours by nursing staff and re-read as positive at 72 hours by an infectious disease physician. Initial direct smears of two separate samples of CSF where negative for acid fast bacil-li， and PCR of the CSF was negative for TB on two different occasions. CT of the chest was obtained to look for possible source of infection and revealed right upper lobe nodules with central cavitations . Biopsy of the lung was performed and pathology revealed necrotizing granuloma-tous inflammation with acid fast bacilli . Initial concentrated direct smears for acid fast bacilli from the lung biopsy where negative， but Mycobacterium tuberculosis was iso-lated and identified by DNA probe with High Performance Liquid Chromatography at 32 days.\n\n【12】Treatment\n\n【13】Treatment should be initiated on the basis of strong clini-cal suspicion. As mentioned previously it may take severalrepeated studies before obtaining positive proof of tuber-culous infection and delay in treatment often leads to irre-versible deficits or death. Recommended treatment is for9-12 months and is divided into two phases. The intensive phase is four drug therapy with isoniazid (INH)， rifampin(RIF)， pyrazinamine (PZA)， and either ethambutol (EMB) or streptomycin (STM) for two months followed by a contin-uation phase of INH and RIF for 7-10 months depending on clinical response and sensitivity of the specimen .\n\n【14】Outcome and follow-up\n\n【15】Once empiric TB coverage was started the patient showed significant clinical response with improvement of his men-tal status， but at the time of discharge still had prominent personality， memory， and functional impairment.\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n\n【17】Our patient is a young， relatively healthy， male with no known prior exposure to TB that presented with a com-plicated case of Tuberculosis Meningitis leading to stroke and long term residual functional deficit. Central nervous system (CNS) TB is encountered frequently in areas thatcontinue to have high prevalence of tuberculosis and dis-semination is very common in children and young adults. CNS TB is a disease that has a relatively low prevalence in North America. It accounts for around 1 percent of all cas-es of TB and 6 percent of extrapulmonary infections in im-munocompetent individuals . Tuberculous meningitis develops most commonly from chronic reactivation in pa-tients with immune deficiency secondary to aging. malnu-trition， alcoholism， malignancy， or HIV infection. Clinical features of TB meningitis commonly consist of a series of phases， beginning with sub acute fever， malaise， and person-ality changes. This may last for two- three weeks and if un-recognized will progress to a meningitic phase. Meningitic phase has more pronounced neurologic features such as confusion， headache，lethargy， and focal cranial nerve def-icits. The final phase， which our patient presented with， is the paralytic phase consisting of stupor， coma， seizures， and possibly stroke . Ifleft undiagnosed and untreated ma-jority of patient will die with in five to eight weeks from on-set of illness .\n\n【18】Diagnosis can be difficult as standard culture methods are quite slow， often taking as much as four to eight weeks for growth and are highly dependent on the number of organ-ism in the inoculum.10 Typical CSF shows elevated protein usually greater than 100， low glucose (80% less than 45)，and elevated WBC (between 100 and 500 cells/microL) with lymphocytic pleocytosis . Serial CSF bacterial examination is critical in diagnosing CNS TB. One series of patients showed an increase in diagnosis with positive smears from thirty-seven percent to eighty-seven percent when four specimens where evaluated. If clinical suspicion is high and initial smears remain negative it is recommend-ed that a minimum of three CSF specimens be obtained. Rapid detection assays for M. tuberculosis in the CSF and pulmonary samples include nucleic acid-based amplifi-cation test (NAAT) that rely upon polymerase chain reaction(PCR). The qualitative assay performed by our Tennessee state laboratory uses PCR to amplify the IS6110 gene and the 16SrRNA gene. The IS6110 and 16SrRNA genes are specific for the M. tuberculosis complex and this assay de-tects as few as 10 cells per sample. The sensitivity of this as-say is 95% for M. tuberculosis . Many laboratories are now also using High Performance Liquid Chromatography(HPLC) with either fluorescence or ultra violet detection of mycolic acids， which has proven to be highly sensitive for M. tuberculosis . These tests should be used in conjunction with standard culture and smears as was done in our patient to increase sensitivity and specificity. Tuberculin skin test is used to identify latent TB by testing cell mediated immu-nity to mycobacterial antigens. Purified protein derivative is injected intradermally causing a delayed type hypersen-sitivity reaction that causes in duration. Test should be read by measuring the induration， not the erythema， in millime-ters. There can be significant variation in measurement and reliability of results depending on the time from skin test-ing and the expertise of the interpreter. Results should be read by a qualified practitioner within 48 to 72 hours， after72 hours test results become less reliable .\n\n【19】Spillage of tubercular protein into the subarachnoid space causes an inflammatory reaction most commonly seen in the base of the brain. If the inflammation goes unchecked it will produce a fibrous mass that may encase cranial nerves and penetrate into vessels leading to vasculitis and resulting in infarction. Multiple lesions may be common allowing for a variety of stroke like symptoms most commonly in the bas-al ganglia， pons， and cerebellum . Given the patho-genesis and predilection for intense inflammation at the base of the brain， CT and MRI tend to have characteristic findings of basilar enhancement and edema with possible infarction and hydrocephalus . Hydrocephalus results form extension of the inflammatory process to the basilar cisterns causing CSF impedance.\n\n【20】Central nervous system TB is a progressive disease that can present in many forms.Although， in general TB is relatively rare in immunocompetent individuals in North America it is something to keep on the differential when dealing with atypical presentations ofinfection.CNS TB is a treatable dis-ease that will be fatal if not recognized. Therefore， it is im-perative to be aware of the key clinical features of TB men-ingitis， and maintain a high level of suspicion when dealing with CNS infection if the cause is unknown\n\n【21】S1S.ociety of America： treatment of tuberculosis.

Most osteomas of the head and neck occur in the mandible， they rarely occur in the maxillary sinus， and free osteomas are extremely rare. While usually detected incidentally on plain radiographs， symptoms appear when the osteoma obstructs the sinus orifice or invades the adjacent orbit or intracranial structures. Herein， we report a case of a patient with an isolated laminar osteoma arising in the maxillary sinus.\n\n【2】Case Report： A 52-year-old man presented to our hospital with a radiopaque mass in the right maxillary sinus. An oval mass of size 2.7x2.3 cm was observed in the right maxillary sinus on computed tomography， and no sinusitis was present. Under general anesthesia， the mass was removed orally via the modified Caldwell-Luc method. Histopathologic examination revealed layered compact bony tissue covered by the sinus membrane. The mass was free from the inferior wall of the right maxillary sinus， and a part of the mass was covered by the sinus membrane. The postoperative course was uneventful， and no recurrence was noted after 5 years.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】We experienced a case of an extremely rare osteoma in the maxillary sinus. The osteoma was solitary and free within the maxillary sinus. The treatment performed was surgical excision using the modified Caldwell-Luc method. The cause of the free osteoma was thought to be odontogenic maxillary sinusitis caused by apical periodontitis of the nearby tooth.\n\n【5】Keywords： Maxillary Sinus· Osteoma\n\n【6】An osteoma is a benign tumor that develops through the pro-liferation of mature bone substance； osteomas are primari-ly composed of mature compact or trabecular bone . The most common site of predilection is the mandible， followed by the paranasal sinuses. The anatomic location is the frontal si-nus in 96% of cases， ethmoid sinus in 2% of cases， and maxil-lary sinus in 2% of cases .Osteomas grow slowly and may spread to surrounding structures， resulting in serious compli-cations such as orbital lesions and intracranialinvasion before they are discovered incidentally during radiographic exami-nation . Additionally， most osteomas are usually contigu-ous with bone tissue and are rarely free . In the present re-port， we describe our experience with a free osteoma arising in the maxillary sinus.\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】A 52-year-old asymptomatic man was referred to our hospital by his general dentist who found a round radiopaque region in the right maxillary sinus. There were no special remarks in his history or his family history. His facial features were sym-metrical， he had no nasal obstruction， and there was no ten-derness or sensory abnormality in the right cheek or subor-bital area. There was no buccal bulging of the right maxillary molar and no tenderness. Panoramic radiographs  and computed tomography (CT) images  showed a well-defined， round， 2.5x2 cm radiopaque mass protruding from the base of the right maxillary sinus into the maxillary sinus， with no continuity between the mass and the root of the right maxillary molar. An osteoma in the right maxillary si-nus was diagnosed. We considered removing the lesion after it grew larger and symptoms occurred， but we also explained to the patient that although this was a benign tumor， there was a possibility of malignant transformation， even if rare. We further pointed out that the free osteoma might migrate to other sinuses such as the frontal sinus， in which case an ex-traoral approach would be necessary， and that scarring might occur outside the oral cavity. The patient provided informed consent for early removal， and the lesion was extracted using the modified Caldwell-Luc method under general anesthesia. A U-shaped bone window was created using an ul-trasonic bone cutting device “Piezosurgery@\") in the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus at the level of the right maxillary molar， with the periosteum attached . Subsequently， an osteotomy was performed at the upper edge of the win-dow， and the mucoperiosteal valve was elevated and opened together with the anterior maxillary wall. A white bony hard spherical mass measuring 2.7×2.3 cm， surrounded by edema-tous maxillary sinus mucosa， was observed in the lower part of the maxillary sinus . The mass was free withinthe maxillary sinus when the sinus was opened， which al-lowed easy removal of the mass. After removal， the bone wall was fixed in position and the wound was closed with absorb-able sutures. The final histopathological diagnosis was lami-nar osteoma， and the tumor consisted of dense laminar bone tissue covered by the maxillary sinus mucosa . Panoramic radiographs and CT scans taken immediately after surgery confirmed the absence of residual lesions in the max-illary sinus， and subsequent followup panoramic radiographs were obtained every year， in consideration of both the time required for a benign osteoma to recur as well as the risks associated with radiation exposure. At present， 7 years have passed since the surgery without any recurrence.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】An osteoma is a fibrous and bony lesion of the sinuses found in 3% of sinus CT scans， most commonly in the frontal and ethmoid sinuses . A study of 16 000 sinus X-ray films indi-cated that osteomas were present in 0.4% of the radiographs. Of this small number， only 5.1% of all sinus osteomas were in the maxillary sinus . Osteoma in the maxillary sinus devel-ops slowly and is often asymptomatic. However， nasal symp-toms such as swelling， pain， nasal obstruction， and rhinor-rhea have been reported due to complications of sinusitis or pressure caused by the development of the osteoma . The present case was incidentally discovered on a panoramic ra-diograph taken during dental treatment， and there were no subjective symptoms. Borumandi et al noted the association between Gardner syndrome and osteomas， especially cranio-facial osteomas . In the present case， there were no den-tal anomalies such as embedded or supernumerary teeth， no history of gastrointestinal diseases such as colorectal polyps， and no family history of hereditary diseases， suggesting no association with genetic diseases such as Gardner syndrome.\n\n【11】Various theories (developmental， traumatic， and infectious) have been proposed for the pathogenesis of sinus osteoma. Varboncove et al  postulated that osteomas arise from em-bryonic cartilage remnants or a persistent periosteum. In other words， it has been suggested that an osteoma is a post-trau-matic or post-inflammatory product， and a possible etiology is the stimulation of the embryonic cartilage remnants . Kaplan et al also suggested that a combination of trauma and muscle traction may be involved in the development of osteomas . In contrast， it has been reported that sinusitis mostly involves only the mucosa； however， sometimes the lesions spill over to the bone . It has also been reported that chronic inflam-mation of the periosteum deep in the mucosa promotes bone formation， which is a factor in osteomas arising in the maxil-lary sinus . Thus， no single theory can adequately explain osteomas， and the topic remains controversial.\n\n【12】Maxillary sinus osteomas are slow-growing and usually as-ymptomatic； however， their anterior extension can cause fa-cial deformity. Further， their continued growth can completely obstruct the sinuses and nasal cavity， leading to the develop-ment of myxomas . The symptoms include pain， swelling， sinusitis， and nasal discharge. Rarely， they may enlarge into the orbit， causing diplopia， ptosis， and vision loss. Koivunen et al reported that asymptomatic， small osteomas do not re-quire surgical treatment and can be observed on routine ra-diographic imaging but should be excised when they fill 50%of the sinus volume . Although the present case was as-ymptomatic， surgery was performed to confirm the diagno-sis and avoid possible future inflammation. The patient had a free osteoma that had separated from the bone of the maxil-lary sinus wall； however， free osteomas that are separate with-in the maxillary sinus are extremely rare. Yamaguchi et al re-ported in a Japanese paper that the possible causes of free osteoma include  osteoma detachment from the sinus wall due to osteoclast action on the stem， and  inflammatory tis-sue destruction due to concomitant sinusitis； but it is difficultto determine the cause . In the present case， the cause of the migration of the osteoma could not be identified. There was no history of trauma， and the thickening of the maxil-lary sinus mucosa and the presence of apical periodontitis in the right upper second molar suggested the involvement of chronic inflammation. Osteoma in the maxillary sinus can beremoved via endoscopy if it is small； however， the Caldwell-Luc method is known to be used to remove large osteomas. In the present case， we also considered different approaches； that is， open surgical versus endoscopic trans-nasal excision. However， if the osteoma is larger than the natural foramen， it is difficult to remove it nasally in a single lump . In addi-tion， we thought that the lesion might remain and cause in-flammation if the osteoma was crushed into small pieces and then removed endoscopically. In this case， the osteoma was large， exceeding 2 cm； thus， the Caldwell-Luc technique was selected as the treatment method. Histopathologically， oste-omas are classified into 3 types： compact osteoma， consisting of dense laminar bone without a marrow cavity； cancellousosteoma， with a marrow cavity； or mixed type， with cancel-lous osteoma being the most common type . The pres-ent case was of a compact osteoma， which is extremely rare among free maxillary sinus osteomas.\n\n【13】Conclusions\n\n【14】In this report， we present a case of a free osteoma in the max-illary sinus that was removed using the Caldwell-Luc method. Osteoma in the maxillary sinus is very rare， and to the best of our knowledge， this is the first report in English of a free os-teoma in the maxillary sinus. It was suggested that the causeof this free osteoma in the maxillary sinus may be related to maxillary sinusitis caused by tooth decay or other factors.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The first pa-tient presented with cervical spinal involvement and a concomitant pyogenic infection in the same location. The second patient presented with lumbar spinal involvement affecting only the posterior vertebral elements characterized by destruction of the vertebral arch. Both patients were operated and multidrug antituberculosis therapy was given for 1 year without any side effects or toxicity. Partial improvement was achieved in the first patient while the second patient recovered completely.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】Clinicians dealing with uremic patients should be aware of unusual manifestations of tubercu-losis in order to establish early diagnosis and initiate intensive appropriate treatment. The cases presented here emphasize that， where available， magnetic resonance imaging is ideal to evalu-ate spinal structures and that early decompressive surgery plus antituberculosis chemotherapy seem to remain the preferred mode of therapy for Pott’s disease.\n\n【6】Key words： spinal tuberculosis · pott’s disease · chronic renal failure · dialysisThe incidence of tuberculosis (TB) mainly with ex-trapulmonary involvement is increased in uremic patients probably as a result of decreased cellular immunity，especially in endemic areas. Diagnosis of extrapulmonary manifestations of TB in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) may be difficult due to atypical symptomatology or unusual features of the disease. This may lead to a delay in the diagnosis and treatment resulting in high mortality .\n\n【7】Spinal TB (Pott’s disease) is a form of extrapulmonary TB which is described as a“diagnostic challenge”in patients with CRF ). Herein two hemodialysis patients presenting with unusual features of Pott’s disease are reported.\n\n【8】CASE 1\n\n【9】A 66-year-old female patient who has been on regu-lar hemodialysis treatment for 3 years for end stage renal disease with unknown aetiology was admitted with a complaint of inability to walk. Three weeks ago she began to feel intermittent pain in the neck which intensified over the last week and was accompanied with fever and progressive weakness in both arms and legs. On physical examination her temperature was 38°C and her blood pressure was 130/70mmHg. She was unable to walk without support. There was tenderness and stiffness in the neck. Two tender lymphadenopathies were found in the left supra-clavicular fossa. Neurological examination revealed bilateral radiculopathy with weakness in all extremity muscles. A white blood cell count of 16000/mmanda hematocrit value of 28% were found. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and serum C-reactive protein(CRP) levels were elevated， measuring 130mm/h and 16mg/dl， respectively. Chest X-ray and compu-terized tomography (CT) of the chest were reported as unremarkable.\n\n【10】Direct X-ray of the cervical spine demonstrated de struction of the C4-C7 vertabral bodies while mag netic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a mass com-patible with an epidural abscess destructing C4-C7vertebral bodies . A purified protein deriva-tive (PPD) skin test was negative. Histopathological examination of supraclavicular lymph node biopsy was reported as granulomatous lymphadenitis. Fine needle aspiration biopsy of the mass lesion detected in MRI consisted of purulent material with nonspecific acute inflammatory cells. Gram and acid-fast stains were both negative. Vancomycine sensitive StaphylocoCCUS aureus colonization was found in blood culture. The patient， then， underwent an anterior decompression and fusion operation. Histopathological examination of the operation specimen revealed granulomatous inflammation characterized by granulomas with central caseifying necrosis， Langhans type giant cells， and epithelioid histiocytes containing acid-fast positive bacilli. There was a nonspecific suppura-C11tive inflammatory infiltrate in the surrounding soft tissues and bone trabeculae. A diagnosis of TB and nonspecific pyogenic cervical osteomyelitis was made depending on the clinical and histopathological find-ings. Antibiotics (vancomycine plus ceftriaxone) and multidrug antituberculosis treatment with rifampin(600mg/day)， isoniazid (200mg/day)， ethambutol(400mg/day)， pyrazinamide (1g/day) were commenced immediately and marked improvement in the clinical and laboratory findings of the patient was observed. Antituberculosis drugs were given daily in adjusted doses for advanced renal failure. They were admin-istrated after the dialysis session on dialysis days. The antibiotic and antituberculosis treatments were continued for 6 weeks and 12 months， respectively. After 1 year of therapy there was partial recovery of the neurological deficits； she remained paraparetic and could only ambulate in a wheel chair.\n\n【11】CASE 2\n\n【12】A 43-year-old female uremic patient under hemodialy-sis treatment for 4 years had recently developed low back pain and mild aching in both legs. Plain x-ray and CT of the lumbar spine revealed osteoporosis. Her serum phosphorus level was 6.2mg/dl， serum calcium level was 8.4mg/dl and serum parathyroid hormone level was 1200pg/dl and active vitamin D pulse therapy for secondary hyperparathyroidismwas started. The pain deteriorated in the following3 months when she developed weakness and numb-ness in both legs. On physical examination， her tem-perature was 37°C and lumbar area was tender on palpation. Neurological examination revealed hypo-esthesia and muscle weakness in lower extremities. Her white blood cell count was 8600/mm，hematocrit was 30%， sedimentation rate was 86mm/h， and CRP was 4mg/dl. MRI of the lumbosacral spine showed destruction in the lamina of the 5th vertebra leav-ing the vertebral body intact with a soft tissue mass compressing the thecal sac . PPD skin test was negative. In both patients there was no history of TB contact， and no sign of pulmonary TB. She under-went the same operational procedure as the first case and histopathological examination showed caseify-ing granulomas containing acid-fast positive bacilli within the cytoplasm of the histiocytes. A diagnosis of spinal TB was made and multidrug antituberculosis treatment was initiated with rifampin， isoniazid， ethambutol and pyrazinamide， as in case 1. After 1year of therapy the patient completely recovered.\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n\n【14】Spinal TB can involve different segments of the spine； thoracic spine being the most common loca-tion， followed by lumbar area while cervical spine is rarely involved . The 1st patient had cervical and the second had lumbar spinal involvement， both presenting with unusual manifestations. The patient with cervical spinal involvement had a concomitant pyogenic infection. To our knowledge only two such cases have been reported describing concomitant bacterial infection with spinal TB . None of these patients were uremic. In the patient with lumbar spi-nal TB， a very rare type of spinal involvement of the disease was observed； only posterior vertebral ele-ments were affected as characterized by destruction of the vertebral arch. Interestingly， it was suggested that this type of involvement could be related to im-mune suppression . However， we could not find any reports of uremic patients with similar involve-ment of spinal TB in the English literature.\n\n【15】The diagnosis of Pott’s disease in uremic patients may be difficult without high index of suspicion and delay in diagnosis is common. There is conflicting data concerning the usefulness of PPD test in uremic patients because of the abnormalities in their im-mune system . Therefore， it was not surprising to have negative PPD tests in both of our patients. Systemic manifestations of the disease， such as fe-ver， night sweats， general malaise may be absent or may mimic the uremic complications of patients on maintenance dialysis. Standard X-rays of the spinemay be negative or confusing during the early phase of the disease resulting in delays of the diagnosis until severe and irreversible damage has occurred. On the other hand， TB of the spine frequently presents with back pain which in patients with CRF can be misdiagnosed as renal osteodystrophy or osteoporosis. Neither of our patients had any spe-cific systemic manifestations. Although conventional X-ray showed some abnormality in the 1st case， the2nd case showed no radiological abnormality except for osteoporosis in her conventional X-ray or CT. Because of the characteristic biochemical findings， her initial symptoms were thought to result from secondary hyperparathyroidism. However， as her symptoms worsened an MRI scan which revealed abnormalities in the spine was performed.\n\n【16】Spinal TB often starts from anteroinferior vertebral body and spreads along the anterior longitudinal liga-ment as it progresses. Then， involvement of adjacent vertebral bodies， disc damage and paravertebral ab-scess formation follows. Anatomical involvement of vertebral disc and the presence of paravertebral soft tissue abscess are considered to be specific radiologi-cal signs for spinal TB . In our 1st patient， though direct X-ray showed destruction of the involved ver-tebrae， spinal TB was highly suspected on MRI whichrevealed affected cervical vertebrae and an abscess in the surrounding soft tissue. We have also demon-strated concomitant bacterial infection in the same location. Spinal TB was not suspected initially in the2nd patient due to atypical presentation， biochemi-cal findings reminiscent of secondary hyperparathy-roidism and lack of findings of spinal TB on initial radiological investigations. Moreover， MRI findings of this case were unusual for spinal TB， involving only posterior segment of the affected vertebra； a very rare type of involvement of spinal TB. Overall， in spinal TB even detailed radiological examination can cause confusion due to atypical images. However， despite conflicting results， MRI is considered to be an im-portant and reliable radiological method in the early and differential diagnosis ， except for remote countries where conventional radiology is still the only method of choice. MRI was also proved to be useful in our cases in the preoperative period.\n\n【17】Though radiological examination can be helpful in the diagnosis of TB， demonstration of the presence of the bacillus both microbiologically and histopatho-logically is considered as the gold standard. Recently polymerised chain reaction (PCR) was shown as a useful diagnostic tool in TB. We failed to perform this investigation in our patients but the histopatho-logical findings in both of the operation specimens were consistent with TB.\n\n【18】In the treatment of Pott’s disease antituberculosis agents are the mainstay of management. The standard therapy is combination of isoniazid， rifampin， and pyrazinamide with or without ethambutol. Chemotherapy for at least12 months should be preferred to shorter courses . The use of antituberculosis medications poses unique problems in dialysis patients due to changes in phar-macokinetics， greater potential for toxic effects， andpossible removal of the drugs with dialysis. Rifampin can be administered at normal dose but isoniazid， pyra-zinamide and ethambutol should be given in adjusted doses for renal failure and the physicians should be cautious about the severe side effects and toxicity of these drugs due to prolonged half life in advanced renal failure . Although dose reduction of these drugs has been advocated by some authors， others， however， made no such separate recommendation for uremic pa tients with TB . A different incidence of side effects from antituberculosis medication， especially neuropsy-chiatric， hepatic and gastrointestinal， was reported in patients with chronic renal failure a parenthesis. However， our patients tolerated treatment regimen and no complication related to drugs was observed. Choice of treatment for spinal TB including chemotherapy and surgery remains controversial. Although there are some reports supporting treatment with chemotherapy alone， most studies indicate that combined therapy is more useful . We treated our patients with combined regimens and had a partial response in one and a complete response in the other.\n\n【19】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【20】Clinicians working for uremic patients and those especially working in areas endemic for TB should be aware of unusual manifestations and should in-clude the disease in their differential diagnosis in order to initiate intensive diagnostic approach and early appropriate treatment. Though not observed in our patients， serious side effects of antitubercu-losis drugs in uremic patients should also be born in mind. Our cases showed that， where available， MRI is the most valuable investigation to evaluate spinal structures in detail， and early decompressive surgery plus antituberculosis chemotherapy seem to remain the best mode of therapy for spinal TB.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

She was diagnosed with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and started on diazoxide. A CT and MRI of the abdomen revealed a 165x77×72 mm cyst with a 51x45x30 mm solid structure connecting to the wall of the cyst by a stalk， raising suspicion of a fetus in fetu. The mass had no connection to her pancreas. Following total excision of the intraabdominal mass， her hypoglycemia resolved.

It is com-monly due to mutations of genes that regulate insulin secre-tion from the beta cells of the pancreas， resulting in focal or diffuse pancreatic hyperplasia . The incidence of PHHI is about 1 in 35 000 live births， but it is more prevalent in coun-tries with a high consanguinity rate . Severe cases usually present in the newborn period， whereas diagnosis of less se-vere forms may be delayed until 3 to 6 months of age. PHHI presents with an inappropriately high ins ulin level in the face of hypoglycemia and an absence of ketosis. Hyperinsulinism suppresses ketone production and gluconeogenesis， mak-ing infant brains even more vulnerable to hypoglycemic dam-age . Prompt diagnosis and treatment is therefore cru-cial to prevent irreversible brain damage. We are presenting a case of severe hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia with an ab-dominal mass in a 6-month-old infant.\n\n【9】Case Report\n\n【10】This full-term， 3370 gm infant was delivered by Cesarean sec-tion. The pregnancy was uneventful except for right hydro-nephrosis and a 30 mm amniotic surface cystic lesion of the placenta on prenatal ultrasound (US) at 25 weeks’ gestation. Physical exam was normal at 4 weeks of age. At the age of 2months she presented with abdominal distention. An US and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen revealed a retroperitoneal 15-cm pure cystic mass  displacing the left kidney inferiorly and a right grade IlI hydronephrosis. Laboratory work-up to rule out possible malignancy included alpha-fetoprotein， human chorionic gonadotropin， and neuron sensitive enolase， which were normal. The blood glucose con-centration was 91 mg/dL. Since she was in significant respi-ratory distress， 700 mL of cystic fluid was aspirated under US guidance. Biochemical analysis was not consistent with urine， and no malignant cells were detected. Within a 3-day period，400 mL of fluid reaccumulated and was again aspirated，leav-ing a smaller cystic mass on US. At age 3 months a repeat US of the abdomen revealed the presence of a small，solid com-ponent within one of the bibulated cysts (25x25x9 mm and28x27x13 mm in diameter) . A voiding cystoure-throgram revealed a right ureteropelvic junction stenosis and grade IIl hydronephrosis. At age 5.5 months she was seen by a pediatric neurologist for concerns of staring spells. An MRI of the brain and EEG were normal. A week later she presented to the pediatric emergency department with lethargy， sleepiness， and abnormal eye movements. Laboratory studies revealed a blood glucose concentration of 23 mg/dL and a simultane-ous insulin level of 18.8 uU/mL (which should be undetect-able with hypoglycemia). Blood ketones were negative， andcortisol concentration was 25.7 ug/dL (5-10 pg/dL). She was given an intravenous bolus of 10% dextrose and was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit with the diagnosis of hyper-insulinemic hypoglycemia. She required a 15% dextrose infu-sion via central line to maintain a blood glucose concentration above 70 mg/dL. Concomitant oral diazoxide was started and increased to 15 mg/kg/day. She demonstrated an abnormally elevated response to glucagon administration during a hypo-glycemic episode with a rise in blood glucose concentration from 37 to 96 mg/dL This confirmed the diagnosis of hyperin-sulinemic hypoglycemia. Despite a good oral intake (breastmilk and formula) and the diazoxide， she required 6.25 mg/kg/min glucose infusion to maintain a blood glucose concentration above 70 mg/dL. An MRl and CT of the abdomen showed a cys-tic mass of 104x61×48 mm in diameter with a 50x40×36mm heterogeneous solid component . At 6 months of age a through-cut biopsy was performed. Histopathological examination showed ductal structures within a myxoid stro-ma with no atypical cells and a low level of mitosis. A deci-sion was made to surgically excise the intra-abdominal mass. Surgical findings are depicted in Figure 2.\n\n【11】Histopathological findings\n\n【12】The entire solid mass consisted of fetal pancreatic tissue simi-lar to that at 3 months' gestation， based on embryologic stag-ing of pancreatic ductal and acinar structures. Almost 95% of the mass consisted of islets of Langerhans. The immune-histo-chemical testing revealed an abundance of insulin-secreting beta cells with scattered areas of glucagon and few soma-tostatin-secreting cells， which are seen in the early embryo-logic stage of development .\n\n【13】Genetic evaluation\n\n【14】Her karyotype was 46 XX with no deletion， duplication， or ab-errant methylation profile of one or more sequences of the KvDMR and H19DMR domains in the 11p15 BWS/Russell-Silver syndrome region. Chimerism testing of the surgically removed material and the blood sample of the infant was performed by using an AmpFISTR Identifiler PCR Amplification kit (Applied Biosystems， Warrington， UK). Briefly， we used 17 different STR markers located at 2p23-2per，2g35-37.1， 3p21.31，4g28，5q21-31，5q33.3-34，7q11.21-22，8g24.3，11p15.5， 12p12-pter，13q22-31， 16q24-qter， 18q21.3，19q12-13.1，21q11.2-q21， Xp22.1-22.3， and Yp11.2. The analysis showed that the surgi-cal material and the baby were genetically identical. The zy-gocity testing of the surgical material demonstrated homo-zygocity at the centromeric region. Whole exon sequencing(WES) of the infant's peripheral blood showed negative mu-tation of the ABCC8 gene and heterozygous variation of hepa-tocyte nuclear factor-1 beta (HNF1B)， (exon 1 (rs747555052)，8cmCalibration：Unknownc.79G>C，p.V27L) and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (exon 1(rs779584301)， c.1860 C>T， p.P454S) genes.\n\n【15】Postoperatively she had marked hyperglycemia， but after 24 h her blood glucose normalized with complete resolution of her hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. At age 8.5 months she was di-agnosed with a congenital hiatal hernia and underwent correc-tive surgery at 11 months. Histologic examination of the sur-gical material showed mature squamous epithelium and was thought to be residue of the previously removed mature tera-toma. The patient is currently 2.5 years of age and has had no subsequent episodes of clinical or biochemical hypoglycemia.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】The mechanism of action was initially unclear in this case of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia with teratoma in this 6-month-old infant. Insulinoma is a very rare cause of hyperinsulinemichypoglycemia in childhood  and therefore had not been con-sidered due to her age and the presence of an intra-abdom-inal mass without connection to her normal appearing pan-creas. The solid component of the mass connected to the wall of the cyst by a 2.5-cm stalk raised the suspicion of a case of fetus in fetu (FIF). The differential diagnoses included pan-creatic heterotopias， mature cystic teratoma (MCT)， and FIF. Pancreatic heterotopia is a rare congenital anomaly in which there is pancreatic tissue with no anatomic connection to the pancreas itself. Pancreatic heterotopia is commonly an in-cidental finding in adults and very rarely reported to cause hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia . In MCT the presence of various tissue types in a cystic mass is characteristic. The pres-ence of mature pancreatic tissue in mediastinal teratomas has been reported； however， none of the cases resulted in hyper-insulinemic hypoglycemia . Although diagnostic criteria have been proposed for FIF ， the differentiation between MCT and FIF is still controversial All cases of FIF occur in identical twins and are always genetically identical to the host. It has been reported that MCT and FIF could be differen-tiated by zygosity . Teratomas are always homozygous at or near the centromeric regions . Although this mass ful-filled the diagnostic criteria of FIF ， it was homozygous at the centromeric region， confirming the diagnosis of an MCT. The presence of a squamous epithelium in a small region was also consistent with a teratoid maturation.\n\n【18】The most interesting point of this case is that the mature ter-atoma with immature fetal pancreatic tissue lacked the nor-mal control mechanisms of insulin secretion. Having extra beta cells does not cause hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia if the beta cell function is properly regulated. During the first trimester， beta cells have immature glucose sensing mecha nisms . The insulin secretion from the fetal pancreas dur-ing early stages of maturation responds to amino acid rather than to glucose concentrations， and at 12 to 22 weeks'gesta-tion， basal insulin secretion from the fetal pancreas is 4-fold higher .Therefore， immaturity of the fetal pancreatic tis-sue may be the reason for the uncontrolled insulin secretion and partial response to diazoxide treatment. Unfortunately， WES on the tumor tissue could not be performed due to the quality and quantity of the available DNA， and we cannot to-tally exclude the possibility of a mutation in the teratoma that could have caused uncontrolled insulin secretion. The WES of the peripheral blood， however， detected a heterozygous vari-ation of HNF1B and IRS1 genes but no mutation of the ABCC8gene. The heterozygous IRS1 variation detected in this case is known to be associated with type 2 diabetes and susceptibility to insulin resistance  and therefore could be a coinciden-tal finding. However， the combination of heterozygous varia-tions of the HNF1B and IRS1 genes may be a new finding for the pathogenesis of persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemiain infants. HNF16 plays an important role in organogenesis， especially of the liver， kidney， and pancreas. Mutations in the HNFip gene cause monogenic diabetes in youth type 5(MODY5)， renal cysts， genital malformations， and pancreas at-rophy . Mutations in the HNF1f gene have not been re-ported to cause hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. This infant had a right ureteropelvic junction stenosis and grade III hy-dronephrosis which could have been due to the detected vari-ation of the HNF1 gene. About one-third of patients with an HNF13 mutation have pancreatic structural anomalies， but a pancreatic teratoma has never been reported with variations or mutations of the HNF1 gene . The specific variation in the HNF1f gene detected in this infant has been reported previously and is considered to be a benign variant or varia-tion of unknown significance . This variation was locat-ed at the dimerization domain of the HNF13 protein， which is important for protein function and therefore might have im-pacted the embryogenesis of the pancreas， causing a pancre-atic teratoma with uncontrolled insulin secretion and severe hyperins ulinemic hypoglycemia in this infant.\n\n【19】Conclusions\n\n【20】The combination of heterozygous variations of HNF1β and IRS1genes in this infant likely played a role in the embryogenesis in utero， causing a pancreatic teratoma and severe hyperin-sulinemic hypoglycemia. Therefore， this should be consideredin the pathogenesis of persistent hyperinsulinemic hypogly-cemia in infants.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

However， maxillary or mandibular lesions are rarely found as a primary manifestation of the disease. This report describes a case of a 65-year-old Palestinian woman with lytic lesions in the maxil-la due to undiagnosed multiple myeloma identified incidentally on cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). A 65-year-old Palestinian woman presented to the Oral Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic with an expansion of the maxilla which was initially thought of as an infection.

She was directly referred to the Hematology Department for further laboratory tests. These included complete blood count， liver function test， bone profile， protein electrophoresis， flow cytome-try， and bone marrow biopsy， which were performed to confirm the diagnosis of multiple myeloma.

It is characterized by neoplastic plasma cell proliferation in the bone marrow. The antibodies that are overproduced by these plasma cells， named M proteins， are monoclonal kappa or lambda light-chain antibodies with or without the heavy chain， which may be detected in serum or urine of myeloma patients . These neoplastic cells stimulate atypical matura-tion of osteoclast precursor cells， which in turn function abnor-mally. An imbalance between bone formation and resorption occurs， resulting in osteolytic lesions， which may mimic a pri-mary bone tumor. These occur frequently in the spine， femur， ribs， humerus， pelvis， and cranium of myeloma patients .Jaw lesions have been reported in 35% of myeloma cases， albeit not as a primary manifestation of the disease . The body， angle， and ramus of the mandible are the parts most affect-ed . Myeloma is preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance， and is characterized by hypercalce-mia， renal insufficiency， anemia， and bone lesions (CRAB). The main features include bone pain， fatigue， and infections . Since the detection of bone lesions is crucial to the diagnosis and treatment of multiple myeloma， the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) has published recommendations for optimal imaging at different disease stages. Cross-sectional imaging such as low-dose computed tomography is recom-mended . Furthermore， the IMWG has published a guideline for diagnosis， investigation， and treatment of myeloma.\n\n【6】Oral signs and symptoms include pain， bleeding， dysphagia， par-esthesia， and amyloidosis . The tongue is the most commonly affected site in the oral cavity； the condition may result in mac-roglossia due to amyloidosis . Presentation of myeloma in the oral cavity is variable. It may appear clinically as a small gin gival mass or as an intra-osseous lesion resulting in facial asym-metry . This disease generally affects men and is considered predominantly a disease of the elderly， usually affecting those between the sixth and seventh decades . Since myeloma in the oral cavity is a rare disease， knowledge of clinical symp-toms and early manifestations is important for early diagnosis. Although the occurrence of either maxillary or mandibular le-sions as an early indicator is relatively rare， a differential diagno-sis of myeloma should be considered for jaw lesions， especially in geriatric patients with other manifestations. Early identifica-tion could influence both the management and outcome of the disease. Such was the case reported by Kasamatsu et al， who re-ported a maxillary swelling as an initial manifestation of myelo-ma . In addition， Ali et al described a mandibular swelling as the first indication of multiple myeloma . The present report describes the case of a 65-year-old Palestinian woman with a lytic lesion of the right maxilla due to undiagnosed multiple my-eloma identified by cone beam computed tomography (CBCT).\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】A 65-year-old Palestinian woman attended the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic seeking treatment for a palatallesion in the right maxilla which had been present for 10months. Intraoral examination revealed buccopalatal expan-sion of the right maxilla with pus discharge and fetid odor. Clinically， the differential diagnosis included a wide range of diagnoses including osteomyelitis， fibrous dysplasia， and lym-phoma. The patient's medical history included diabetes melli-tus， hypertension， osteoporosis and idiopathic thrombocyto-penia purpura. The patient was taking 500 mg metformin， 15mg amlodipine， 70 mg alendronic acid， and 5 mg predniso lone. No other clinical symptoms were reported. A CBCT was requested for the area， after which an incisional biopsy was performed under local anesthesia.\n\n【9】CBCT imaging showed a total opacification of the right maxil-lary and frontal sinuses with an associated irregular destruc-tion of the right maxillary sinus walls and maxillary tuberosi-ty as well as sequestrations . Sclerotic changes and thickening of the right pterygoid plates were also evident. The radiographic findings of the maxillary bone and maxillary si-nus were suggestive of a long-standing infection. However， further evaluation of the entire CBCT examination revealed that the skull， cervical vertebrae，and mandible demonstrated multiple，“punched-out\"， osteolytic lesions with an associated perforation of the cortical boundaries . These ra-diographic features are classically seen in multiple myeloma.\n\n【10】The sections submitted for microscopic evaluation consisted of viable bone trabeculae with active marrow intermixed withinflammatory cells . Multiple areas showed sheets of atypical plasma cells. The plasmacytoid cells showed eccen-tric nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm . Immunohistochemical stains demonstrated positivity to CD138with Lambda positivity  and negativity to CD3and CD20 . Accordingly， the histologic picture was suspicious for plasma cell neoplasm.\n\n| Test name  | Patient  | Reference  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Test name  | result  | range  |\n| WBCs  | 16.66  | 4.5-11.5K/ul  |\n| RBCs  | 4  | 4-5.4K/uL  |\n| Hemoglobin  | 10.7  | 12.0-15.0 g/dL  |\n| Hematocrit  | 34.2  | 35-49%  |\n| MCV  | 85.3  | 80-94 fL  |\n| MCH  | 26.7  | 32-36pg  |\n| MCHC  | 31.3  | 32-36%  |\n| Platelets  | 480  | 150-450K/uL  |\n| Albumin  | 23  | 40.2-47.6g/L  |\n| Total protein  | 81  | 64-82 g/L  |\n| CRP  | 3.2  | 0-3mg/L  |\n| ESR  | 28  | 1-20mm/H  |\n\n| Test name  | Patient  | Reference  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Test name  | result  | range  |\n| Immunoglobulin-G  | 11.4  | 5.4-16.1 g/L  |\n| Immunoglobulin-A  | 1.7  | 0.8-2.80 g/L  |\n| Immunoglobulin-M  | 0.26  | 0.5-1.9g/L  |\n| Kappa  | 1.77  | 1.7-3.7 g/L  |\n| Lambda  | 0.99  | 0.9-2.1g/L  |\n| B2-Microglobulin  | 7.9  | 0.7-1.8 mg/L  |\n| Aspartate aminotransferase  | 8  | 15-37 U/L  |\n| Alanine aminotransferase  | 19  | 12-78 U/L  |\n| Gamma-glutamyl  | 3  | 5-85 U/L  |\n| transferase  |  |  |\n| Bilirubin  | 3  | 0-17 umol/L  |\n| Lactate dehydrogenase  | 154  | 100-240 U/L  |\n\n【13】WBCs -white blood cells； RBCs -red blood cells； MCV - mean corpuscular volume； MCH- mean corpuscular hemoglobin； MCHC- mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration； CRP-C-reactive protein； ESR-erythrocyte sedimentation rate.\n\n|  | 36.2  | 40.2-47.6g/  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Alpha-1  | 5.4  | 2.1-3.5g/l  |\n| Beta-2  | 4  | 2.3-4.7g/l  |\n|  | 12.6  | 8.0-13.5g/l  |\n\n【15】The patient was then referred to the Hematology Department for diagnosis. Hematologic investigations were done . These revealed low albumin， immunoglobulin M， aspartate ami-notransferase， and gamma glutamy. transferase.On the other hand， C-reactive protein， alpha-1 protein， and B2 microglobu-lin were elevated. Serum-free light chain concentrations were within normal range. Complete blood count showed high white blood cell count， normal red blood cell count， and low red blood cell indices (hemoglobin， hematocrit， mean cell hemoglobin，and mean cell hemoglobin concentration). Protein electrophoresis displayed low albumin and high alpha-1 protein . Bone function profile was within normal limits .\n\n【16】The bone marrow aspirate was moderately hypercellular， mega-karyocytes were adequate， myelopoiesis was hyperactive， and erythropoiesis was reduced with normoblastic maturation. Blasts were less than 1%， lymphocytes constituted about 14%， plasma cells were increased 16%， and rare binucleated forms were present. Histiocytes were prominent and active. Trephine biopsy was done showing hypercellular marrow with atypical plasma cells in different arrangements. There was reduced hematopoiesis. The myeloid/erythroid ratio was preserved.\n\n| Calcium  | 2.32  | 2.12-2.52 mmol/L  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Phosphate  | 1.40  | 0.81-1.58 mmol/L  |\n| Alkaline phosphatase  | 58  | 40-150U/L  |\n\n【18】Skeletal survey and urinalysis were negative. Flow cytometry results showed cells that were initially identified using CD138and side scatter. These CD138 gated cells showed expression of CD56， while CD19 and CD45 were negative， which was con-sistent with multiple myeloma. The patient was treated with chemotherapy (Zoledronic acid， cyclophosphamide， bortezo-mib， and dexamethasone). The disease was controlled in a year. Three years after the initial diagnosis of the multiple my-eloma， however， the patient died due to renal complications.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】Primary myeloma of the maxilla is a rare presentation. Since CBCT played a major role in the diagnosis of this case， it is recommended that dental practitioners to be aware of radio-graphic features and possible oral manifestations of myeloma to avoid any delay in medical intervention. In general， multi-ple myeloma is a malignant neoplasm of monoclonal plas-ma cells. Symptoms of bone resorption， bone pain， fractures， anemia， and thrombocytopenia are a result of the prolifera-tion of these plasma cells in the bone marrow. In addition， they secrete a detectable abnormal immunoglobulin frag-ment known as M protein in serum or Bence-jones protein inurine. Furthermore， these fragments may result in renal dis-ease or amyloidosis .\n\n【21】It is important to be aware of common presenting symptoms to allow early diagnosis and management of the myeloma. At presentation， around a third of myeloma patients are asymp-tomatic. However， during routine examination， some inciden-tal anomalies in renal or blood analysis may be observed . Nonspecific symptoms are commonly reported， such as bone pain， anemia， fatigue，and osteolytic skeletal lesions. At initial diagnosis， extramedullary disease is found in roughly 1-2% of myeloma patients . As proposed by the IMWG， in simple words， a myeloma diagnosis is based on the concentration of clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow (>10%)， or a biopsy showing bony or extramedullary plasma cytoma and one or more of the CRAB features that indicate organ damage： hy-percalcemia， renal insufficiency， anemia， or bony lesions . Additionally， any one or more of the biomarkers of malignan-cy， such as a serum-involved/uninvolved light chain ratio of100 or greater or more than one focal lesion on MRI that is at least 5 mm in size， can support the diagnosis of myeloma. In the current case， the patient had clonal bone marrow plasma cells of around 16% with extramedullary osteolytic bone in-volvement of the maxilla， and anemia.\n\n【22】According to the Saudi Cancer Registry， 1% of cancer cases in Saudi Arabia are due to myeloma， and the incidence is ap-proximately 1% in males and 0.7% in females . The World Health Organization country profile indicated that， as of 2019，9.6-11% of cancer-related deaths in Saudi Arabia were attrib-utable to myeloma or lymphoma . Although it is consid-ered a disease of the elderly， with an average age of diag nosis of about 70 years， patients in Saudi Arabia have been diagnosed with myeloma before the age of 50 . Similarly， Kasamatsu et al reported a maxillary swelling as first evidence of myeloma in a 33-year-old Japanese male patient . In ad-dition， the male to female ratio of myeloma is about 1.5. Reported cases of myeloma patients in Saudi Arabia have a more favorable response to treatment despite being young-er， with a worse prognosis， and having a higher disease stag ing than similarly described populations. The lower myeloma incidence in Saudi Arabia may be attributable to high levels of misdiagnosis and misclassification. Furthermore， due to delayed diagnosis and age， patients are more likely to be of-fered palliative care as opposed to a referral to a specialized hospital . A myeloma consensus in Saudi Arabia， similar to the IMWG， determined that the diagnostic criteria for multiple myeloma should include more than 10% clonal bone marrow plasma cells or biopsy with evidence of plasmacytoma， either bony or extramedullary. In addition， recognized CRAB symp-toms and positivity of 3 specific biomarkers are needed to es-tablish myeloma-defining features . It is crucial to note that the time between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis canbe detrimental for hematological malignancies. Importantly， as of 2016， the average time to reach a diagnosis of myeloma was 3-5.5 months， and may extend beyond 12 months . To date， in Saudi Arabia， there are no current data that reliably estimate the average time between initial presentation and diagnosis. Reports of referral to a specialist hematologist/on-cologist can extend from 6 months to a year after noticing the initial myeloma symptoms. In the present case， the time be-tween initial diagnosis and start of treatment was 3 months. The length of time before referral in Saudi can be attributed to lack of clarity in the system， making it rather complicated. Distance to the hospital and long waiting lists are also among the most common barriers .\n\n【23】As stated， seldom are oral manifestations the first sign of mul-tiple myeloma； 30% of patients develop osteolytic lesions in the jaws and this usually indicates a more advanced disease with extensive skeletal involvement . Nevertheless， in 12%of the cases， the first clinical signs of the disease may be oral manifestations. The most commonly reported oral symptoms of myeloma are intraoral swelling 65%， bone pain 33%， pares-thesia 27%， and amyloidosis 11%.Osteolytic lesions have been detected in 90% of cases， radiographically . As was the case with the current reported patient， intraoral swelling was the main presenting feature. Previous publications， such as those by Kasamatsu et al and Ali et al， also describe gnathic swelling(maxillary and mandibular， respectively) as the first evidence of myeloma in otherwise healthy patients . Once the sus-picion of myeloma is present， the achievement of diagnosis re-quires the demonstration of malignant plasma cells histolog ically， as well as immunohistochemistry analysis to establish clonality. Histologically， myeloma cells show a variety of mor-phological features， including normal plasma cell morphology and large nuclear pleomorphism . They are classified into4 types： mature， immature， pleomorphic， and plasmablastic. Plasmablastic myeloma cells are characterized by large size， nuclear polymorphism， and mitotic forms resembling diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. They display increased cellular atypia， and their presence indicates a poor prognosis . Accordingly，3 cytological features of plasma cells are important： nucle-ar pleomorphism， cytoplasmic clearing， and high nucleo-cyto-plasmic ratio . It is important to distinguish between reac-tive plasmacytosis and malignant disease. In the present case， sheets of atypical monoclonal plasma cells were seen. This his-tologic criterion is important for the diagnosis of myeloma， es-pecially since the pattern of infiltration and plasma cell mor-phology could affect the prognosis of the myeloma . The confirmation of plasma cell monoclonality is mandatory for diagnosing myeloma. The standard for cytogenetic analysis is fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) . Conversely， nu-merical aberrations are highly detectable by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based mapping arrays and comparative genomic hybridization . Numerous studies have reporteda correlation between morphological and morphometrical fea-tures of myeloma cells and clinical outcome， including progno-sis with clinical stages and survival. Certain features that indi-cate a worse prognosis include atypical plasma cells， plasma cells constituting more than 15% of cells in the bone marrow aspirate， high levels of B2 microglobulin， and the presence of plasmablastic myeloma cells . Flow cytometry analysis re-vealed abnormal expression of antigens， including CD56，CD20， CD117，and CD10， in nearly 90% of myeloma cases. The most commonly expressed of these markers is CD56， the presence of which is sufficient for a definitive diagnosis of myeloma and a poor prognosis， whereas CD117 expression correlates with a better prognosis . As reported by Alaskar et al in the Saudi Arabian multiple myeloma consensus， the lack of availability of gene expression profiling， a significant prognostic tool， in Saudi Arabia hinders the identification of a high-risk profile .\n\n【24】Radiographically， the presence of multiple punched-out osteo-lytic lesions with no adjacent bone reactions is characteristic of multiple myeloma. The differential diagnosis of myelomain-cludes bone metastases and other hematopoietic malignancies such as lymphoma and leukemia. The radiographic features， in our case， were the initial drivers of myeloma suspicion， and this truly highlights the importance of an accurate radiologic interpretation and the complete evaluation of the entire CBCT examination. Misdiagnosis of myeloma may result in delayed or inappropriate management， such as root canal therapy； re-ports have shown a misdiagnosis of periapical inflammato-ry lesions， odontogenic cysts， and even temporomandibulardisorders . Reports about incidental findings on CBCT are common， with the majority being of a benign nature . Price et al reported that 90% of the 300 reviewed CBCT scans con-tained an incidental finding. An average of 16% required in-tervention and 15% required monitoring. The authors showed that no incidental discoveries of malignancies were observed in their study， indicating that they are relatively unusual find-ings . In addition， reports of undiagnosed myeloma discov-ered incidentally on dental imaging are uncommon .\n\n【25】Conclusions\n\n【26】This report illustrates the role of CBCT imaging， supported by a multidisciplinary approach， in the diagnosis and management of multiple myeloma. In the current case， a maxillary lesion was the first symptom of myeloma， emphasizing the dentist's critical role in the detection and early diagnosis of systemic diseases. Although gnathic bones are affected in 30% of the cases， it is rare as the initial presenting feature. Consequently， dental practitioners should be aware of radiographic charac-teristics and oral manifestations， especially in the elderly， to avoid any delay in management.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

OHS can lead to pulmonary hypertension. It has not been clearly demonstrated that OHS with pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and right heart failure. A case is presented of right ventricular dysfunction and right ventricular failure secondary to OHS.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 53-year-old man， who was morbidly obese with a BMl of 75 kg/m， presented with shortness of breath (SOB) and hypercapnia. He had never smoked but had a history of severe OSA and hypertension. On examination， the patient was obese with normal lung auscultation and mild pitting edema of the lower extremities. A spi-ral computed tomography (CT) angiogram showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism or interstitial lung dis-ease. Pulmonary function testing showed no obstructive airway disease and a normal diffusion capacity. Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed normal left ventricular function and a dilated right ventricle (RV) with a flattened septal wall， moderate tricuspid regurgitation， and an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 55-60 mmHg. The patient was discharged on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and oxygen at night， and as needed during the day.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】This report has shown that OHS without underlying causes of alveolar hypoventilation can result in isolated right ventricular dysfunction and right ventricular failure.\n\n【6】MeSH Keywords： Heart Failure· Hypertension， Pulmonary·Obesity Hypoventilation SyndromePopulation data from the US between 2011 and 2014 showed that 37% of adults were obese， with a body mass index (BMI) of >30 kg/m² . Up to 30% of severely obese hospitalized pa-tients with a BMI 235 kg/m? have been reported to have hy-poventilation syndrome (OHS) . It is important to recognize this condition， as patients with OHS with a BMI 235 kg/m²who are hospitalized are reported to have a one-year survival of only80%. Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is characterized by a body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m?， daytime hypercapnia， an arterial carbon dioxide tension 245 mmHg， and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) . OHS can lead to pulmonary hyperten-sion and right ventricular failure， but right ventricular hyper-trophy can be associated with preserved cardiac function .\n\n【7】Due to the obesity epidemic in the US， OHS is now likely to be the second most common cause of chronic hypercapnia seen clinically， with the most common cause being chronic obstruc-tive pulmonary disease (COPD)， with interstitial lung disease being less common. Advanced neuromuscular diseases， such as muscular dystrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis can result in hypercapnia resulting in the need for ventilatory sup-port. Patients who suffer from a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) may also develop chronic hypercapnia and need ventilatory support. All these patients with advanced neuromuscular dis-ease will need a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and tracheostomy before placement in a long-term care facility.\n\n【8】Isolated right ventricular dysfunction with or without right ven-tricular failure can occur with COPD， chronic thromboembol-ic pulmonary hypertension， acute pulmonary embolism， and chronic lung disease other than COPD that results in hypox-emia. However， it remains unclear whether or not OHS alone can cause isolated right ventricular dysfunction and right ven-tricular failure. This report is of a case of OHS and isolated right ventricular dysfunction with right ventricular failure.\n\n【9】Case Report\n\n【10】A 53-year-old man， who was morbidly obese with a BMl of75 kg/m?， presented with shortness of breath (SOB) and hy-percapnia. He had never smoked but had a history of hyper-tension and severe obstructive sleep apnea with an apnea-hy-popnea index (AHI) >30 per hour. There was no known family history of cardiac disease， and the patient did not have a his-tory of syncope.\n\n【11】On examination， his blood pressure was 132/83 mmHg， and he had a regular pulse of 98 bpm， a respiratory rate of 20breaths/minute， a temperature of 98.7°F， with oxygen satura-tion (SaO，) of 88% on room air. His heart sounds were normaldisease on pulmonary function testing . Left ventricular function were evaluated in at least 39 patients， with right ventricular function evaluated in 25 patients . Left and right ventricular dysfunction was found in some patients . However， it was unclear whether there were patients with right ventricular dysfunction who did not have left ventricular dys-function . Also， pulmonary embolic disease and intersti-tial lung disease could not be completely excluded by spiral CT angiography and non-contrast-enhanced CT， respectively . Therefore， in this previous study， there was no clear cut evi-dence to support the presence of right ventricular dysfunction due to OHS and pulmonary hypertension \n\n【12】Table 1.

The findings were in keeping with left ventricular hypertrophy with a normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)， severe right ventricle (RV) dilatation and dysfunction， left and right atrial enlargement， and moderate pulmonary hypertension.\n\n【20】Chest computed tomography (CT) showed normal lung paren-chyma without pulmonary embolism. Two-dimensional trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed normal left ventricular function and a dilated right ventricle (RV) with a flattened sep-tal wall (1.3 cm in diameter)， moderate tricuspid regurgitation，an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 55-60 mmHg， right and left atrial dilatation， mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy， and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50%. The right ventricle was severely dilated and dysfunc-tional . There was moderate tricuspid regurgitation(max. velocity 303 cm/sec) with an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) of 55-60 mmHg . Pulse-wave tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) of the anterior and posterior mitral annulus showed abnormal left ventricle relaxation. The patient was discharged on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and oxygen at night， and as needed during the day.\n\n【21】Discussion\n\n【22】The gold standard diagnostic procedure for the identification of pulmonary hypertension is right heart catheterization， with pulmonary hypertension defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) 220 mmHg . Four studies have used right heart catheterization to demonstrate the presence of pulmo-nary hypertension in patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) . Sugerman et al. identified pulmo-nary hypertension in 23/26 patients with OHS . However， only nine patients (34.6%) had pulmonary hypertension with-out left heart dysfunction. Kessler et al. studied 34 patients with OHS， 29 had right heait catheterization， 17 patients(59%) had pulmonary hypertension， but only 19/181 (10.5%) with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) alone had pulmonary hy-pertension . There was no difference in cardiac output de-termined by thermodilution between patients with OHS and those with isolated OSA . Kauppert et al. performed right heart catheterization in 21 patients with OHS and found pul-monary hypertension in 17/21 (81%) patients . However， three patients had postcapillary pulmonary hypertension， and14/21 (66.7%) had pulmonary hypertension not related to left heart failure . Held et al. identified 12 patients with OHS， but three patients also had chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-ease (COPD) that complicated the clinical presentation . Therefore， nine patients with OHS had pulmonary hyperten-sion (defined as a mean PAP 225 mmHg) by right heart cathe-terization . All patients had normal left ventricular function， although the average data from 17 patients who underwent right heart catheterization were presented， and patients with OHS and pulmonary hypertension were not analyzed in isola-tion . These four previously published clinical studies sup-port that pulmonary hypertension secondary to OHS occurs in some patients without left heart failure， COPD， interstitial lung disease， or other causes .\n\n【23】Although right heart catheterization is the best way to deter-mine the presence of pulmonary hypertension， transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) provides an estimate of the presence or absence of pulmonary hypertension . A large studyby Almeneessier et al. investigated 77 patients with OHS who were screened for the presence of pulmonary hypertension with TTE . In this previous study， pulmonary hypertension was defined as a pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP)>40 mmHg . Fifty-three (68.8%) out of 77 patients had pul-monary hypertension， and none had prior treatment with non-invasive ventilation . In this previously published study， the body mass index (BMI) was 43.2+10.4 kg/m? and the average age was 60.5±11.7 years . The study showed that pulmo-nary hypertension is common in patients with OHS who have not been treated with noninvasive ventilation when initially screened by TTE . These previous studies using TTE in screen-ing for pulmonary hypertension in OHS are consistent with the right heart catheterization data and show that pulmonary hy-pertension can occur in the absence of left ventricular failure.\n\n【24】The use of the apical four-chamber view in TTE to diagnose pulmonary hypertension measures tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV) and reflects the difference in pressure between the right atrium (RA) and the right ventricle (RV). Assuming that there is no pulmonary stenosis， the right ventricular Sys-tolic pressure (RVSP) is assumed to be equivalent to the pul-monary artery systolic pressure (PASP) and can be calculat-ed from the Bernoulli equation using an estimated right atrial pressure determined from an inferior vena cava echocardio-gram  . The Bernoulli equation is as follows：RVSP=4(TRV)+estimated RA pressure\n\n【25】RVSP=PASP in the absence of pulmonary stenosis\n\n【26】A PASP >40 mmHg is consistent with a mean PAP >25 mmHg. A mean PAP of ≥25 mmHg is currently defined as pulmonary hypertension . However， a PASP>40 mmHg is a conserva-tive value， and an even lower PASP may be consistent with pulmonary hypertension but may risk overdiagnosis (false pos-itives) and is used less often. However， right heart catheter-ization measures the mean PAP directly and is the gold stan-dard for diagnosing pulmonary hypertension.\n\n【27】The case in the present report had pulmonary hypertension with normal left ventricular function， and a brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) of 160 pg/ml. The patient had never smoked. The spiral computed tomography (CT) angiogram showed no evidence of pulmonary embolic disease or interstitial lung disease， and pulmonary function tests showed no obstruc-tive or restrictive lung disease. However， the patient did have moderate pulmonary hypertension on TTE， with right ventric-ular dysfunction and right ventricular dilation. Right ventric-ular dysfunction and ventricular failure manifested clinical-ly as bilateral leg edema. We believe this to be a rare case of OHS with resultant pulmonary hypertension that resulted in right ventricular dysfunction and mild right ventricular failure.\n\n【28】An underlying mechanism for pulmonary hypertension second-ary to OHS is chronic nocturnal and diurnal hypoxemia， hyper-capnia， and acidosis that leads to chronic vascular constric tion and vascular remodeling . Also， patients with OHS have increased upper airway resistance and reduced respira-tory compliance . In some patients， these factors may re-sult in a significant effort to breathe， resulting in hypercapnia and hypoxemia that also promote recurrent pulmonary arterial vasoconstriction， vascular remodeling， and pulmonary arteri-al hypertension . Previous studies have shown that OSA re-sults in right ventricular dysfunction . The Framingham study evaluated sleep-disordered breathing in patients with a BMI of 32+5 kg/m² compared with those without sleep-dis-ordered breathing . The study found a small but signifi-cant increase in right ventricular wall thickness . However， right atrial and right ventricular dimensions and right ventricu-lar systolic function were no different than in the controls， and there was no clinical right ventricular failure .\n\n【29】Dorsunoglu et al. used a complex myocardial performance in-dex (MPI) and compared subjects with mild or moderate OSA compared with normal controls . All subjects， patients and normal controls， had normal left ventricular systolic function as determined by measurement of the ejection fraction .Those patients with moderate OSA had an increased left and right MPI compared with the normal controls and compared with mild OSA . No patients had clinical symptoms of ventricular fail-ure or clinical heart failure . The right ventricular diastolic diameter in all subjects was normal and varied from 9 mm to30 mm . This finding was in contrast to the finding in the patient in this report who had a markedly enlarged right ventric-ular diastolic diameter of 78 mm . Romero-Correl et al. also used the same MPl index and compared normal patients with patients with mild OSA and moderate to severe OSA . The patients with moderate to severe OSA when compared with controls had an increased right and left MPl index， consistent with right and left cardiac dysfunction， despite normal left ven-tricular systolic function measured by the ejection fraction . The patients did not have clinical symptoms of heart failure . An additional finding was an increased left atrial volume index consistent with diastolic dysfunction that was present in the OSA patients and not present in normal controls . The patient in the present case report also had diastolic dysfunction， which was probably secondary to his systemic hypertension. These latter three studies showed that subclinical right ventricular dysfunc-tion could occur without clinical heart failure in patients with OSA . However， the patient in the present case report also had OHS and would be expected to have more severe and prolonged pulmonary hypertension， which would be more like-ly to result in right ventricular failure over time.\n\n【30】Conclusions\n\n【31】This case report has shown that obesity hypoventilation syn-drome (OHS) with pulmonary hypertension， without obstructivelung disease， can result in right ventricular dysfunction and right ventricular failure. This condition should be diagnosed and managed clinically， as the mortality for OHS is high. Effective treatment includes weight loss， treatment at night with con-tinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or noninvasive bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilation， as needed， and diuretics if the patient progresses to right heart failure.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Dyspnea is the predominant presenting respiratory symptom， usually af-ter years of liver disease . There is no clear correlation be-tween severity of HPS and either severity or underlying cause of liver disease . The diagnosis of HPS can often be missed due to nonspecific presentation and presence of other comor-bidities. Currently， there is no effective medical therapy for HPS and liver transplantation remains the only option to improve both oxygenation and survival .\n\n【6】We present the interesting case of a 43-year-old man who pre-sented with progressive， unexplained hypoxemia and shortness of breath in the absence of any symptoms or signs of chronic liver disease. After extensive cardiopulmonary investigations， nodular cirrhosis was incidentally detected on a thoracic com-puted tomography (CT) scan. He was subsequently diagnosed with severe hepatopulmonary syndrome as a result of non-al-coholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-related cirrhosis and underwent successful orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in our unit.\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】After several recordings of oxygen saturation at rest of 85-90% in his GP clinic， a 43-year-old man was referred to the sleep clinic at our institution. Given his anthropometric fea-tures， his GP considered sleep-disordered breathing as the probable cause of his hypoxemia. He denied snoring or day-time sleepiness， but he admitted to dyspnea on mild exer-tion. There was no history of chest pain， cough， weight loss， or excessive bleeding. Of note， his body mass index (BMI) was37.6 kg/m2. He had had previous surgery for excision of a pi-tuitary adenoma and was maintained on steroid and thyroid hormone supplementation. He had no history of smoking or alcohol consumption. His cardiovascular and respiratory ex-aminations were unremarkable. At rest， his pulse oximetry ox-ygen saturation (SPO2) was 89%， remained unchanged with position， and dropped rapidly to 75% after 1 min of normal walking. With supplemental 100% oxygen，SPO2 rose to 100%. On arterial blood gas， pH and partial pressure of carbon di-oxide (pCO2) were normal， confirming type 1 respiratory fail-ure with a partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 62 mmHg on room air， with age-corrected alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient(AaPO2) of 52 mmHg.\n\n【9】He underwent extensive pulmonary and cardiac investiga-tions. An overnight sleep study revealed no sleep-disordered breathing， but abnormal oximetry with average SPO2 of 88%. Pulmonary function tests (PFT) revealed normal spirometryand lung volumes but a very low diffusing capacity for car-bon monoxide (DLCO) of 31%. Results of chest X-ray， comput-ed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA)， and high-reso-lution thoracic computed tomography (HRCT) were normal. A pulmonary ventilation perfusion (VQ) scan showed no evi-dence of VQ mismatch.\n\n【10】A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal right and left ventricular function with right ventricular systolic pres-sure (RVSP) of 20 mmHg. A bubble contrast echocardiography test (CEE) at this stage was attempted but was inconclusive. Cardiac catheterization showed normal coronaries and pulmo-nary artery pressures and absence of any intracardiac shunt.\n\n【11】In the absence of any detectable pulmonary or cardiac etiology， video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) lung biopsy was planned to rule out other primary pulmonary pathology. He tolerated this procedure well and significant macroscopic venous dilata-tion was noted at surgery. CTPA had been repeated as a part of preoperative investigations ， this time revealing mild main pulmonary artery dilatation and normal intrapulmo-nary vessels with no peripheral dilatation， but there was in-cidental detection of features suggestive of liver cirrhosis on upper abdominal cuts.\n\n【12】His liver function tests (LFTs) were normal . Coagulation profile showed thrombocytopenia with a count of 60 000 per microliter. Four-phase CT liver revealed cirrhosis with portal hypertension and splenomegaly. Hepatic venous pressure gra-dient measurement showed HVPG of 10 mmHg， further con-firming portal hypertension. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed gastric varices. HPS was suspected at this point and confirmed through a repeat bubble test， which was positive for intrapulmonary shunt (IPS). VATS lung biopsy showed his tological features compatible with HPS and pulmonary artery hypertension with extensive vascular remodeling . His oxygenation was gradually deteriorating， with cyanosis and room air PO2 of 53.2 mm Hg. He was listed for orthotopic liv-er transplantation， with severe hepatopulmonary syndrome and mild portopulmonary hypertension (POPH) from NASH-related cirrhosis as the indication， confirmed on pathologi-cal examination of the explanted liver . His model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score was 7 at the time of listing and he remained on continuous home oxygen therapy at 2 I/min while waiting for transplantation. He was success-fully transplanted 1 year after listing. His intraoperative and postoperative periods were uneventful and he was discharged home after 14 days. At 12-month follow-up， our patient re-mains asymptomatic with normal resting oxygen saturation and requiring 2 I/min of supplemental oxygen for mobilization.\n\n【13】Table 1.

In patients with cirrhosis undergoing evaluation for LT， the prevalence of HPS is estimated at 5-30% . There are no reported mul-ticenter prevalence studies， and the wide range in prevalence is partly a result of the range of definitions used for deoxy-genation . Though most commonly seen in patients with portal hypertension and cirrhosis， HPS has been reported in association with acute and chronic hepatitis without portal hy-pertension or cirrhosis and in patients with noncirrhotic por-tal hypertension .\n\n【17】The arterial oxygen tension (PO2) can be deceptively normal in the early stages of HPS. Hyperventilation and associated decreased arterial carbon dioxide often occurs in the setting of cirrhosis， and alveolo-arterial oxygen gradient (AaPO2) is a more sensitive indicator of deoxygenation in this setting .\n\n【18】The recommended diagnostic cut-off for deoxygenation is AaPO2 215 mmHg on room air or AaPO2 ≥20 mmHg for pa-tients older than 64 years . Using PO2， HPS can be classi-fied as mild (PO2 280 mmHg)， moderate (PO2 260 mmHg to<80 mmHg)， severe (PO2 250 mmHg to <60 mmHg)， or very severe (PO2 <50 mmHg or <300 mmHg on 100% oxygen). Defective oxygenation results from ventilation perfusion mis-match caused by microvascular dilatation within pulmonary arterial circulation. With disease progression， increased intra-pulmonary shunt and/or impaired diffusion may contribute further to the severity of hypoxemia .\n\n【19】Dyspnea on a background of chronic liver disease is a common presentation of HPS. Platypnea (increased shortness of breath while sitting up from prone position)， orthodeoxia (decrease in arterial saturation by more than 5% or 4 mmHg in erect position)， spider nevi， and clubbing are more common in pa-tients with HPS but are not specific to the condition . Apart from progressive dyspnea， none of these features werepresent on initial presentation in our patient， which contrib-uted to the delay in diagnosis. In a retrospective study of 22patients， Krowka et al.  reported the mean duration of re-spiratory symptoms (primarily dyspnea) before the diagnosis of HPS as 4.8 years (range 1-10 years).\n\n【20】Severity of HPS has no consistent correlation with the severity of hepatic dysfunction ， as demonstrated in our patient， who had a PO2 <60 mmHG (indicating severe HPS) but nor-mal synthetic liver function tests. Very low carbon monoxide diffusion was the only abnormal respiratory result observed in our patient that was consistent with previous reports .\n\n【21】Pulse oximetry saturation of <97% is a simple screening test for HPS， with sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 65%. To make a diagnosis， however， ABG determination of oxygen-ation is necessary . A positive bubble test result with con-trast-enhanced echocardiography (CEE) is a recommended di-agnostic criterion . CEE using agitated saline is simple and inexpensive and is the most sensitive test for detecting intra-pulmonary shunt . Saline is agitated to produce bubbles\n\n【22】\\>10 microns in size， injected through a peripheral vein， and the right atrium and right ventricle are observed for presence of bubbles. Normally， with pulmonary vascular diameters of <10microns， bubbles are absorbed within the pulmonary circula-tion. Appearance of bubbles in left heart chambers within 3 car-diac cycles indicates intracardiac shunt. Delayed appearance of bubbles in left heart chambers (3-6 cardiac cycles after appear-ance in right heart chambers) suggests intrapulmonary shunt.\n\n【23】HPS may coexist with other cardiopulmonary comorbidities， which may contribute to impaired gas exchange， such as chron-ic obstructive pulmonary disease， restrictive lung disease， and hepatic hydrothorax. In addition to a careful history-taking and physical examination， a lung perfusion scan with techne-tium-labeled macroaggregates of albumin (99 mTcMAA) may help to distinguish the degree of hypoxemia caused by IPVD(abnormal brain uptake >6%) in the setting of coexistent in-trinsic cardiopulmonary disease . The MAA lung-brain per-fusion scan does， however， have limitations， being less sen-sitive than CEE and unable to distinguish intracardiac from intrapulmonary shunting .\n\n【24】Portopulmonary hypertension (POPH) is another important con-dition that may coexist in patients with HPS. In a retrospective review of 80 patients， Fussner et al.  reported that IPVD was present in 59% of patients with POPH and was associat-ed with decreased survival. POPH results from obstructed pul-monary arterial flow in the setting of portal hypertension and requires right heart catheterization (RHC) measurement for diagnosis. Diagnostic criteria include： mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) >25 mm Hg， pulmonary vascular resistance(PVR)>3 Wood units (240 dynes/s per cm-5)， and normal pul-monary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) . Dyspnea is com-monly present in POPH but is not specific . AaPO2 may be elevated， but hypoxemia is usually mild， even in the setting of moderate-to-severe POPH . In contrast to HPS，targeted medical therapy for pulmonary hypertension in POPH may be beneficial in improving functional capacity .\n\n【25】Currently， there is no established medical therapy for HPS . Supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation >88% is frequently recommended， but there are no data to confirm clinical benefits . Pharmacotherapies directed at possi-ble humoral mediators of IPVD have shown inconsistent bene-fits . Nitric oxide (NO) inhibition with methylene blue， gar-lic supplementation， nebulized L-NAME， and norfloxacin haveshown conflicting results . Pentoxifylline improved ex-perimental HPS in rats by inhibiting tumor necrosis factor alpha(TNF-alpha)， but not in human studies . Portal decom-pression with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt(TIPS) has been suggested， but the benefit is uncertain and it may in fact increase the severity of HPS by exacerbating the hyperkinetic circulatory state .\n\n【26】OLT remains the only effective therapy in improving oxygen-ation and survival. Our patient remained on continuous oxygen therapy until OLT. There was no further hepatic decompensa-tion. His PO2 on room air decreased from 62 mmHg at initial presentation to 53.2 mmHg at diagnosis of HPS 2 years later， but did not decrease further in the year waiting for transplan-tation. Swanson et al.  observed a decline in mean PO2 of5.2 mmHg per year in patients with HPS awaiting OLT. HPS pa-tients who did not undergo transplantation had worse 5-year survival compared with the matched control group who un-derwent transplantation (23% vs. 63%， respectively). A base-line PO2 of 50 mmHg or less is associated with worse survival.\n\n【27】Following OLT， complete resolution of hypoxemia is observed but is slow， often taking up to 12 months and sometimes lon-ger . Considering the poor prognosis without OLT and favorable post-OLT outcome even for patients with severe hypoxemia ， allocation of exception points in MELD score is recommended .\n\n【28】Conclusions\n\n【29】Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is an important vascular complication of hepatic disease and significantly affects sur-vival. HPS may occur without overt clinical manifestations ofliver disease and needs to be considered in the differential di-agnosis of unexplained hypoxemia. Due to the limited under-standing of its pathophysiology， no effective pharmacotherapy is currently available to treat HPS. Improvement in oxygenation is seen in most patients after hepatic transplantation， even in patients with severe pre-transplant oxygenation defects.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

A 58-year-old female with history of a lump on her forehead since childhood， which began to grow rapidly after experiencing a closed-head injury.

She underwent emboliza-tion of the tumor， and 2 days later underwent bilateral frontal craniectomy and cranioplasty. Histopathologic findings confirmed this diagnosis.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】Intraosseous skull hemangioma may be confidently diagnosed and differentiated from other skull lesions by its imaging characteristics. An accurate diagnosis is essential to selecting correct management and avoiding complications.\n\n【5】MeSH Keywords： Bone Neoplasms· Hemangioma， Cavernous· Skull\n\n【6】Intraosseous skull hemangiomas are rare benign tumors of endo-thelial origin that account for 0.2% of all bone tumors and 10%of the benign tumors of the skull . Intraosseous hemangiomas are usually found in the vertebral column， but are rarely seen in the cranium. The frontal bone is the most commonly involved， fol-lowed by the parietal bone， temporal bone， and， less frequently， the occipital bone . They are mostly encountered in adults in the 4th to 5th decades of life， the ratio being 3： 2 more common in females than in males. To date， there is no documented racial variation in the frequency of skull hemangiomas .\n\n【7】The etiology of a skull hemangioma remains unclear. Some are thought to be congenital， while others authors propose trauma as a causative factor . These benign tumors develop from the vessels in the diploic space that arises from branches of the external carotid， usually being the middle meningeal and superficial temporal arteries . They can mimic other more common skull lesions and therefore can be difficult to diagnose preoperatively. We present a rare case of a large skull hem-angioma that started growing rapidly after a traumatic event in a 58-year-old female patient. Our goal is to emphasize the imaging characteristics of this tumor and to demonstrate its pathological correlation. The clinical presentation， differential diagnosis， and treatment of this disorder are also discussed.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 58-year-old woman presented with a history of a small bump on her middle forehead since childhood， which began to grow rapidly for the past year after she received a closed-head injury from a ladder that fell on her head. She denied symptoms such as headaches， seizures， altered mental status， or any focal neurological deficit. Other medical history and a review of systems were insignificant. Physical examination revealed a palpable， painless， hard mass. The overlying skin was mobile and normal in appearance.\n\n【10】Plain skull radiographs showed an expansile lytic lesion along the frontal skull， in which the original impression of the mass by a radiologist was a meningioma . Subsequent CT and MRI studies without contrast were performed. The CT scan revealed a large， well-demarcated， trabeculated mass with a sunburst pattern arising from the frontal skull . The brain MR showed the mass to be mostly T2 hyperintense and T1 isointense， with interspersed hyperintense components. Given the characteristic sunburst pattern， the preferential diagnosis was a hemangioma.\n\n【11】Neuroendovascular Services decided to perform a cerebral an-giogram， which revealed a vascular mass with feeders from theleft middle meningeal artery， and went on to embolize the tumor with coils . Two days later， Neurosurgery Services operated on the patient under general anesthesia， and in a su-pine position via a bifrontal subperiosteal approach， the mass was exposed. A reddish-brown， highly vascular lesion， with cav-ernous blood-filled spaces between the bony trabeculae was seen at the bifrontal region. The mass expanded externally and intracranially， and the inner surface of the mass had significantly adhered to the dura mater. A bifrontal craniectomy with com-plete resection of the tumor was performed， including a margin of surrounding uninvolved bone. Subsequent cranioplasty with a polymer implant was done to cover the 9x10 cm skull defect. The gross specimen showed a protruding， well-delineated lesion from the bone . Histological ex-amination concluded that， in effect， this was a cavernous heman-gioma . Post-operative CT revealed complete resection of the tumor with expected post-surgical changes . The patient was discharged 2 days later without complications.\n\n【12】She was evaluated in the outpatient clinic 5 weeks later. She did not present any symptoms such as focal neurological defi-cits，seizures， altered mental status， or headaches at this time. After 5 months， she was re-evaluated and has remained as-ymptomatic with optimal healing of the surgical site， demon-strating a well-restored contour of the forehead.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Intraosseous hemangiomas are classified histopathologically according to the vascular network as venous， arteriovenous， cavernous， or capillary type . The cavernous hemangioma is composed of large， thin-walled vessels and sinusoids linedwith a single layer of endothelium . On gross inspection， the tumor tends to be well-demarcated， fleshy， vascular， and unencapsulated with cystic red cavities.\n\n【15】Intraosseous skull hemangiomas are usually discovered inciden-tally on imaging given its asymptomatic course in the majority of the cases . In this case， however， further management was sought due to esthetic concerns given its large size. There are several radiologic features that help radiologists arrive at the correct diagnosis. Skull x-rays usually demonstrate a lytic， expansile lesion with a honeycomb or sunburst pattern .\n\n【16】Head CT confirms the findings of plain film because of its ex-cellent characterization of trabecular and cortical details ； it will present an expansile bone lesion with thin borders and a characteristic sunburst pattern of trabecular thickening ra-diating from a common center. Tumor expansion may result in erosion of the internal and external plates. Homogeneous en-hancement is seen upon intravenous contrast administration .\n\n【17】Brain MRI characteristics largely depend on the proportion of fat and vascularity the lesion has. In T1-weighted images， interme-diate signal intensity is predominantly seen， with scattered fociof hyper- and hypo-intense T1 signal. Low signal intensity on T1-weighted images usually indicates a decreased amount of fatty tissue or a greater amount of vascularity. On T2-weighted images， a heterogeneous hyperintense mass is seen. This ap-pearance is due to cavernous or cystic vascular spaces con-taining stagnant blood. Thickened trabeculae demonstrate low signal intensity in all sequences. Additionally， hemangiomas avidly enhance after gadolinium contrast administration .\n\n【18】Utilization of preoperative angiography and selective emboli-zation has been a controversial topic in the literature. Some authors state that vascular control is not necessary if an ad-equate margin of normal bone is resected . However，many authors recommend preoperative embolization， espe-cially of larger vascular lesions， to reduce intraoperative blood loss . Angiography confirms the hypervascularity of the lesion， demonstrating a delayed blush， with distinguishablefeeding arteries but no draining veins . The most common arterial feeders are branches of the middle meningeal， superfi-cial temporal， and posterior occipital arteries . In our case， we felt that preoperative angiography and embolization of the feeding arteries before undergoing surgery limited intraopera-tive bleeding and helped maintain a clean field for resection.\n\n【19】In some series， nearly 50% of intraosseous hemangiomas occur in the craniofacial bones， predominantly in the calvarium. The spine is involved in approximately 20% of cases. However， if autopsy data is taken into account， the vertebral bodies are the most com-mon site of this lesion. Less frequently， hemangiomas involving the major long tubular bones of the lower extremities and ribs have been documented. Hemangiomas involving long tubular bones are usually larger than those of the skull and spine， since they usually become symptomatic when they grow large .\n\n【20】The differential diagnosis includes any solitary expansile in-tradiploic cranial lesion with normal overlying skin. As most scalp lumps are of benign origin， meningioma is usually con-sidered because it is one of the most frequent entities. Another diagnostic consideration is metastasis because most malig-nant scalp masses are of metastatic origin. Other differential diagnoses that must be considered are： lymphoma，osteoma， aneurysmal bone cyst， giant cell tumor， Langerhans cell his-tiocytosis， sarcoma， fibrous dysplasia， and dermoid tumor . Nevertheless， with careful examination of the lesion's imaging characteristics， we can arrive at an accurate diagnosis.\n\n【21】The characteristic appearance of honeycomb or sunburst pat-tern of bony spicules radiating from the center of a radiolucent round or oval defect is an important imaging feature that candistinguish a hemangioma from other lesions. It is crucial to recognize these features， as this will aid physicians in selecting the best management for the patient and to avoid complica-tions. The correlation with histologic findings showing multi-ple thin-walled vascular spaces lined by endothelial cells and enclosed by loose connective tissue and bony trabeculations is important to arrive at a definitive diagnosis .\n\n【22】Skull hemangiomas rarely require treatment， and indications include mass effect， hemorrhage control， and esthetic improve-ment. As was seen with our case， the rapid increase in size was probably due to repeated hemorrhage， especially given the his-tory of trauma. If it is indicated， the treatment of choice is total resection with an adequate normal bone margin to reduce the risk of bleeding. Cases of recurrence after complete resection have not been described . Prior to surgery， embolization of the tumor may be performed to reduce the intraoperative blood loss . When surgical removal is not possible，radio-therapy is another alternative， but radiotherapy only prevents the tumor from growing and it cannot eradicate the lesion .\n\n【23】Conclusions\n\n【24】Intraosseous skull hemangiomas are rare benign tumors that can mimic other more common calvarial tumors. Although his-topathological confirmation after surgical resection is the de-finitive method for diagnosis， in most cases the diagnosis can be made with certainty by its imaging findings. Imaging char-acteristics play a crucial role in diagnosing this entity and can prevent complications such as severe hemorrhage from rou-tine biopsy and curettage.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

She did not respond to standard therapy with tolvaptan(15.0 mg/day). However， the present case demonstrated that adding high-dose spironolactone (100 mg/day) to low-dose tolvaptan (15.0 mg/day) is safe and well tolerated， resulting in an increase in urine output and im-provement of the symptoms or signs of ADHF in a patient who was refractory to loop diuretics and tolvaptan. The short- and long-term efficacy of high-dose spironolactone combined with low-dose tolvaptan may be as-sociated with an attenuation of the aldosterone level， which is increased through V. activation by vasopres-sin during tolvaptan administration.\n\n【5】MeSH Keywords： Aortic Stenosis， Subvalvular·Cardiomyopathy， Hypertrophic · Heart Failure·Receptors， Vasopressin· SpironolactoneTolvaptan is a selective V， receptor antagonist that can relieve the signs and symptoms of heart failure (HF) without alter-ing blood pressure or affecting renal function . Recently， it was reported that vasopressin induces aldosterone release from adrenal gland cells through activation of the V receptor， and that vasopressin promotes an increase in renin-angioten-sin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activity by modulating macula densa cells via the V. receptor . It was also reported that tolvaptan did not alter plasma renin activity or the angiotensin Il level， but significantly increased plasma aldosterone . This means that the reactive increase in vasopressin in HF patients receiving tolvaptan is associated with elevation of aldosterone level， suggesting that a high-dose mineralocorticoid receptor an-tagonist (MRA) combined with a V， receptor antagonist might be of interest， especially in acute decompensated heart failure(ADHF) patients . However， the short-and long-term efficacy of a high-dose spironolactone combined with tolvaptan remains unclear in the setting of ADHF. We report the case of an elderly female patient who had ADHF with a preserved EF due to ob-structive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and severe aor-tic stenosis (AS). When high-dose spironolactone (100 mg/day) was added to low-dose tolvaptan (15.0 mg/day)， this patient showed good short-and long-term response.\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】An 86-year-old woman with a history of chronic HF due to obstructive HCM and AS was transferred to our hospitalcomplaining of persistent dyspnea (New York Heart Association class I). She was on multiple medications for management of chronic HF， including torasemide (8 mg/day)， spironolactone(25 mg/day)， metoprolol (120 mg/day)， losartan (50 mg/day)， and disopyramide (300 mg/day). On admission， her blood pres-sure was 98/74 mmHg and her heart rate was 54 beats/min. Echocardiography revealed a left ventricular (LV) ejection frac-tion of 68% with LV hypertrophy (maximum LV wall thickness of 20 mm)， a peak left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradi-ent of 144 mmHg at rest due to systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve， and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. In addition， echocardiography demonstrated severe AS (peak aortic valve velocity of 5.7 m/s and mean aortic valve gradient of 48 mmHg). As shown in Figure 1， we could distinguish be-tween obstructive HCM and severe AS (i.e.， dynamic vs. fixed ob-struction) by the shape of the continuous-wave Doppler veloc-ity curve . A chest radiograph revealed moderate pulmonary congestion and bilateral pleural effusions . Based on these findings， she was diagnosed as having ADHF with apre-served EF due to obstructive HCM and severe AS. Laboratory tests showed that blood urea nitrogen was 33.2 mg/dl， serum creatinine was 0.60 mg/dl， serum sodium was 142 mEg/l，serum potassium was 4.2 mEg/l， and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) was 5857 pg/ml.Oxygen saturation was below 90% on room air. She was not considered to be a candidate for implanta-tion of a permanent pacemaker， septal ablation with ethanol， or surgical therapy because of her advanced age and insuffi-cient motivation. Therefore， intravenous administration of fu-rosemide (40 mg/day) was added from day 1 after hospital admission， and low-dose tolvaptan (7.5 mg/day) was added from day 4 to keep the serum sodium concentration withinthe normal range. Over a 4-day period after admission， a to tal urine output of 1000 to 1200 ml/day was transiently main-tained with coadministration of furosemide (bolus infusion of40 to 60 mg/day)， spironolactone (50 mg/day)， and low-dose tolvaptan (7.5 mg/day)， but the patient’s orthopnea and oxy-gen saturation showed little improvement. Accordingly， dose escalation was performed for both tolvaptan (increased from7.5 to 15.0 mg/day) and furosemide (bolus infusion was in-creased from 60 to 80 mg/day)， but there was no significant improvement of ADHF by hospital day 19. In addition， her urine output gradually decreased despite up-titration of tolvaptan to 15.0 mg/day. However， soon after up-titration of spirono-lactone (from 50 to 100 mg/day) was added to tolvaptan at15.0 mg/day， total urine output exceeded 1500 ml/day and was maintained at this level during hospitalization， despite taper-ing and discontinuation of furosemide. Her dyspnea was also markedly alleviated and she improved from New York Heart Association class IV to class ⅢIl. Chest radiographs obtained on hospital day 25 showed very little pulmonary congestion or re-sidual pleural effusion. Since discharge from hospital， she hasremained on the same medications and has been followed up at our outpatient department for 18 months without adverse changes of serum electrolytes or readmission for exacerba-tion of HF .\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】It is well documented in the literature that a selective V，re-ceptor antagonist results in sustained body weight loss along with an early decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure without RAAS activation . However，there is a reactive increase in vasopressin that results in activation of the unpro-tected V. receptor in the myocardium and vascular wall dur-ing tolvaptan administration . It has also been shown that V receptor deficiency leads to hyporeninemic hypoal-dosteronism， while Via receptor stimulation promotes aldo-sterone production by the adrenal gland . Taken together， these reports suggest that the reactive increase in vasopressin in HF patients receiving tolvaptan is associated with elevationof the aldosterone level . Recently， Pitt et al. reported that combining a V， receptor antagonist with high-dose MRA might be useful for ADHF P. However， little information has been available regarding the efficacy of high-dose spirono-lactone combined with tolvaptan in ADHF patients. The pres-ent elderly patient had ADHF with a preserved EF due to both obstructive HCM and severe AS. Her baseline serum sodium concentration (142 mEq/l) was at the high end of the normal range. She did not respond to standard therapy with low-dose tolvaptan (15.0 mg/day). It is noteworthy that up-titration of tolvaptan from 7.5 to 15.0 mg/day resulted in a decrease in the urine output. We hypothesized that the addition of high-dose spironolactone (2100 mg/day) to tolvaptan would at-tenuate an increase in aldosterone levels by Via activation by vasopressin， which was displaced during tolvaptan adminis-tration， and that this combination therapy could lead to an increase in urine output. As expected， up-titration of spirono-lactone from 50 to 100 mg/day combined with tolvaptan at15.0 mg/day achieved rapid and significant improvement of ADHF. No adverse effects of this combination therapy were noted during the short- and long-term phases of treatment. It was reported that the elevation of aldosterone in HF pa-tients receiving tolvaptan might require addition of high-dose MRA therapy to block the MR and thus achieve diuresis . Accordingly， the combination of a selective V，receptor antag-onist with a high-dose MRA could achieve an increase in urine output along with a decrease in plasma volume . However， we had no data regarding plasma aldosterone concentrations in the present case， suggesting that further study will be nec-essary to examine potential associations among spironolactonedoses， plasma aldosterone concentrations， and outcomes in ADHF patients. However， with regard to the safety of high MRA doses in HF patients， it was reported that the diuretic resistance of loop diuretics may be reversed with high-dose MRA， and the resultant increased urinary potassium losses may also protect against any clinically relevant hyperkalemia in HF patients who receive a high-dose spironolactone . Indeed， a small study reported that loop diuretic-resistant pa-tients who were on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment for cardiac failure demonstrated an important na-triuresis with 100 mg/day spironolactone without any clini-cally important rise in plasma potassium concentration . However， in elderly HF patients with high-dose loop diuretic resistance， the safety of use of high-dose MRA has not been fully evaluated.17 Accordingly， further studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of high-dose spironolactone associated with overcoming high-dose loop diuretic resistance are nec-essary for elderly HF patients.\n\n【10】Conclusions\n\n【11】The present case demonstrates that adding high-dose spi-ronolactone to low-dose tolvaptan is safe and well tolerated， resulting in an increase in urine output and improvement of the symptoms or signs of ADHF in a patient who was refrac-tory to high-dose loop diuretics. The short-and long-term ef-ficacy of high-dose spironolactone combined with low-dose tolvaptan may be associated with an attenuation of the al-dosterone level， which is increased through V. activation byvasopressin during tolvaptan administration. Thus， the pres-ent case suggests that an addition of high-dose spironolactone to tolvaptan is beneficial for advanced HF patients refractory to standard medical therapy for ADHF. However， a prospec-tive study is required to examine the efficacy and safety ofcombining of tolvaptan with high-dose spironolactone for the treatment of ADHF.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "d09abfeb-ca9f-4309-b9e9-13e7011d7b19", "title": null, "text": "【0】Background：\n\n【1】The most common neurological symptoms from cardiac myxoma-induced stroke include territories of middle cerebral arteries， rendering posterior stroke less common. Although transient global amnesia usually has a be-nign prognosis， amnesia in the setting of concerning cerebellar symptoms should raise the suspicion for pos-terior circulation involvement. These benign-appearing symptoms can be manifestations of an acute cerebro-vascular accident (CVA). This unusual presentation can delay workup for underlying pathology\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 67-year-old woman presented to the local emergency department after an episode of global amnesia that lasted about 15 minutes and was associated with some dizziness. The patient also reported a history of chron-ic disequilibrium. The head CT scan was negative for any acute findings. A follow-up MRI of the brain demon-strated acute small lacunar infarcts within the left cerebellum and right parietal lobe.An echocardiogram was performed due to concern for the cardioembolic source， which revealed left atrial myxoma. She was trans-ferred to a tertiary center for immediate surgical intervention due to the high risk of embolization associated with the condition. The patient subsequently underwent successful surgical excision of the lesion.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】Cardiac myxoma， although a rare cause of posterior stroke， needs prompt intervention as it is associated with a high risk of systemic embolization， including recurrent CVA. Transient global amnesia is an atypical presen-tation of cardiac myxoma that can easily be overlooked， delaying timely diagnosis and prompt intervention. Early recognition and surgical resection are crucial to prevent potentially life-threatening consequences.\n\n【6】Keywords： Myxoma· Brain Infarction · Ischemic Attack， Transient · Amnesia， Transient GlobalEmbolization from cardiac myxoma is not an uncommon phe-nomenon. However， it is quite uncommon for transient amne-sia to be the predominant symptom from embolization of car-diac myxoma. Clinical manifestations may vary greatly， from obstruction of blood flow， tempering valvular structures， to embolization. In most cases， the tumor releases fragments or thrombi into the systemic circulation， leading to embolization. The most serious and potentially life-threatening complication of cardiac myxoma is cerebrovascular accident (CVA) second-ary to embolization. The most common presentations of cardi-ac myxoma-induced stroke include hypoesthesia， hemiparesis， and facial paresis due to cerebral infarction . Here， we pres-ent a unique case in which nonspecific dizziness and transient global amnesia were the predominant presenting symptoms in our patient， who was subsequently found to have multifo-cal infarct involving the cerebellum. Atypical presentation of this nature can undermine suspicion for underlying stroke and thus delay prompt diagnosis and treatment .\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】A 67-year-old woman initially presented to the Emergency Department (ED) following an episode of transient memory loss with associated dizziness. Her medical comorbidities included history of breast cancer status after bilateral mastectomy and curative chemotherapy without recurrence，peripheral neurop-athy from chemotherapy， hypertension， hyperlipidemia， type 2diabetes， heart failure with mid-range ejection of 45-50%，mor-bid obesity (body mass index 45)， mild obstructive sleep apnea， and asthma. The patient reported that her episode of global am-nesia lasted approximately 15 minutes and was preceded by mild lightheadedness. Upon further questioning， she reported a long-term history of difficulty with gait instability and tendency to veer toward the left side， which was intermittent. In addition， she also noticed occasional difficulty with balance， not related to positional change. She denied having headaches or change in vision and hearing， had no trouble swallowing or pain with swelling， and no new numbness or weakness ortingling. All lab-oratory tests in the ED were within normal limits. A head com-puted tomography (CT) scan done in the ED was negative for acute findings. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed acute lacunar infarcts present within the left cerebel-lar hemisphere， measuring 7x4 mm， and within right parietal lobe， medially measuring 5x4 mm and slightly more laterally， measuring 2 mm. Given the multifocality and bilaterality， an embolic source was suspected. No hemorrhage， mass， midline shift， hydrocephalus， or extra-axial fluid collection was noted.\n\n【9】Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed， which demonstrated a 2.5×1.5 cm left atrial myxoma attached tothe fossa ovalis  and a severe mitral calcification in a 1.3-cm mobile mass in the posterior chordae . The patient was started on a low-intensity heparin infusion prior to being transferred to a nearby tertiary care center for fur-ther surgical management. Continued workup at the tertiary facility with CT chest angiography demonstrated normal-ap-pearing coronary arteries. There was no additional pathology within the chest and no pulmonary embolism. TEE again dem-onstrated a similar left atrial mass attached to the fossa ovalis with lobulated appearance suggestive of left atrial myxoma. Also， the calcified hypoechoic lesion measuring 1.2x1 cm on the mitral annulus posterior leaflet that was previously seen in the TTE was suggestive of extension of calcification. A second myxoma was thought to be less likely given the echogenicityof the lesion. EF was normal at 60%， with no regional wall mo-tion abnormalities and normal left atrial appendage without thrombus. Follow-up cardiac MRI demonstrated an approxi-mately 2-cm left atrial mass with narrow-based attachment to the intra-atrial septum with location， morphology and cardi-ac MR tissue characterization consistent with left atrial myx-oma. This mass was attached to the intra-atrial septum by a narrow neck. The mass demonstrated indeterminant/vari-able intensity on T1-weighted imaging， predominantly hypo-intense and isolated to hyperintense to myocardium on T2-weighted imaging. The mass also demonstrated perfusion on perfusion imaging and heterogeneous enhancement on post-contrast imaging. No intracardiac mass/thrombus was noted. Cardiovascular Surgery (CV) was consulted and recommended surgical excision. She proceeded to the operating room and un-derwent successful resection of her cardiac myxoma without any postoperative complications. Samples from both the cal-cified portion of mitral annulus and myxoma were sent for bi-opsy. The mitral valve sub-annular excision of calcification was evaluated with Verhoeff-Van Gieson stain， which was consis-tent with calcified tissue. Similarly， immunoperoxidase studies were performed using antibodies detected against calretinin and PRKAR1A showed the lesional cells to be positive for cal-retinin and to have retained expression of PRKAR1A， indicat-ing a low likelihood of Carney complex.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Cardiac myxomas are benign tumors that originate from endo cardial sensory nerve tissues. They are made of myxoid extra-cellular matrix rich in glycoproteins and proteoglycans. While intracardiac tumors are uncommon in general， cardiac myxo-mas comprise 80% of cardiac tumors . The most common sites for cardiac myxoma are the left atrium and the inter-atrial septum at the fossa ovalis. Its clinical manifestation may vary widely based on its size and location. Due to their location， cardiac myxomas commonly affect valvular functions， includ-ing mitral and tricuspid regurgitation， and result in left ven-tricular outflow tract obstruction and congestive heart failure. Left atrial myxomas can mimic mitral stenosis and mi-tral regurgitation， resulting in severe enlargement of the left atrial， as observed in our patient . Thus， dyspnea or respi-ratory distress are some of the primary symptoms secondary to significant cardiac myxoma . This can be further asso-ciated with typical heart failure manifestations， including or-thopnea， paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea， pulmonary edema， cough， hemoptysis， edema， and fatigue. Additionally， cardiac myxoma can also present with arrhythmias and constitutional symptoms. While larger cardiac myxomas can cause symptoms predominantly due to mechanical interference of cardiac anat-omy and flow obstruction， small cardiac myxomas with irreg-ular tumor surfaces are at an increased risk for embolization.\n\n【12】Tumors smaller than 3 cm are associated with a higher risk of embolic events involving cerebral infarctions . Embolization of myxomatous tissues is seen in approximately 50% of pa-tients and can affect multiple organs， including the kidneys， spleen， and central nervous system. When the central ner-vous system is involved， it primarily causes cerebral infarc-tion or recurrent TIAs. Neurological manifestations of cardiac myxoma can have a range of presentations， from syncope to overt neurological deficits. Although these embolic phenom-ena from cardiac myxoma are common， atrial myxomas ac-count for only 0.5% of all strokes . Moreover， cerebellar in-volvement， as in our patient， is even rarer .\n\n【13】Embolization from cardiac myxoma mainly involves the mid-dle cerebral artery territory， including the parietal region， tem-poral region， and basal ganglia. Common presenting symp-toms include hypoesthesia， hemiparesis， and facial paresis . Involvement of PICA territory infarcts is not as common and presents with acute vertigo， vomiting， headache， gait distur-bances， and horizontal nystagmus ipsilateral to the lesion， with headache being the most common initial symptom. Cerebellar signs are a quite uncommon presentation of cardiac myxoma， and transient global amnesia may be underreported. This un-usual presentation can easily deviate providers away from pur-suing cardioembolic workup.\n\n【14】Our patient's chief concern was transient global amnesia (TGA) with associated dizziness. The differential diagnosis for TGA is broad and includes causes ranging from psychogenic and neurogenic to ischemic disease， including complex migraines， seizures， and even cardiovascular episodes. We could rule out psychogenic and neurogenic causes based on her history. We excluded some common reasons for her nonspecific dizziness， such as vertigo or presyncope， based solely on lack of posi-tional attributes. Metabolic derangements were ruled out by initial normal laboratory work. Furthermore， our patient had no history of using illicit drugs and did not report any recent changes in her other home medications that could be a po-tential causative factor.\n\n【15】The cardiovascular origin of TGA has been questionable and is generally thought to be benign， although many authors and publications in the past have also attributed this to throm-boembolic occlusion. Some of the significant cardiovascular mechanisms by which TGA has been thought to occur are tran-sient obstruction in the territory of a posterior cerebellar ar-tery or anterior cortical artery leading to the lack of blood sup-ply in the deep limbic system involving memory . Compared to TIA， patients with TGA without any other concerning neu-rological deficit have been reported to have a benign course compared to TIA regarding having a subsequent stroke and recurrent CVAs . However， in the presence of other con-cerning neurological histories， cerebellar involvement shouldbe suspected. In our patient， although her TGA lasted only for15 minutes， it was associated with dizziness. Along with this， her history of veering toward the left side and gait instabili-ty pointed toward potential posterior circulation involvement. Transient amnesia of this nature， the predominant presenta tion of CVA without any focal neurological deficits， is uncom-mon， thus masking the concern for underlying stroke. Our pa-tient was asymptomatic on presentation and was reluctant to consider pursuing further intervention. Without a high level of clinical suspicion， we could have easily missed her under-lying stroke. Thus， it is imperative that clinicians consider the overall clinical picture and implement timely intervention to prevent adverse outcomes， including life-threatening stroke and death. Given the multifocal nature of the infarcts based on MRI， the cardioembolic source was suspected in our pa-tient， and we thus proceeded with further cardiac imaging.\n\n【16】The primary imaging modality for cardiac myxomas is the echo-cardiogram. Myxomas present on the endocardial surface as spherical masses with speckled echogenic foci . MRI provides a more detailed， accurate evaluation to narrow down the diag-nosis when assessing for cardiac myxomas. These tumors have a characteristic heterogeneous appearance on MRI due to their assorted contents， including myxoid tissues， fibrous tissues，cal-cifications， and blood. Myxomas are also larger and more mo-bile than thrombi， which can be distinguishing characteristics on imaging . Also， the risk of embolism of cardiac myxo-mas may be further complicated by calcifications. Areas of cal-cification are echogenic on imaging. This can be distinguished from typical cardiac myxomas， which have a heterogeneous appearance due to the different types of tissues present .\n\n【17】While cardiac CT can be used when cardiac MRI (CMR) is not readily available， CMR is still the diagnostic modality of choice in the diagnosis of cardiac myxoma. The T1 and T2 weight se-quences in cardiac MRI give helpful information on the chem-ical microenvironment within the tumor and thus provide es-sential cues to differentiate the type of tumor present. Cardiac imaging alone is sufficient to decide about the need for sur-gery . Further biopsies are obtained to establish a defin-itive diagnosis based on histopathology findings. Calretinin is a crucial immunohistochemical marker used to establish the diagnosis of cardiac myxoma . In our patient， cardi-ac MRI findings showed narrow-based attachment to the in-tra-atrial septum， variable intensity on T1-weighted imaging， predominantly hypo-intense and isolated to hyperintense to myocardium on T2-weighted imaging， intact perfusion on per-fusion imaging， and heterogeneous enhancement on post-con-trast imaging. The location， morphology， and cardiac MR tis-sue characterization were consistent with left atrial myxoma. Additionally， immunoperoxidase studies performed using an-tibodies detected against calretinin and PRKAR1A showed the lesional cells to be positive for calretinin and intact PRKAR1Aexpression. Thus， based on CMR and biopsy findings， we con-cluded our patient had cardiac myxoma. It is important to emphasize that mutation in PRKAR1A is associated with he-reditary conditions like Carney complex (CNC)， which is an au-tosomal dominant disorder multiple neoplasm syndrome in-volving myxomas of heart， skin， neuroendocrine neoplasms， and other tissues. About 20% to 40% of the patients affect-ed by the condition have cardiac myxoma and an associated high mortality rate. Patients with PRKAR1A mutation tend to have more severe clinical manifestations， with higher frequen-cy of recurrent and metastatic myxoma .\n\n【18】Surgical resection is the definitive treatment for cardiac myxo-ma， with 2% to 5% recurrence in spontaneous cases. However， in cardiac myxomas that demonstrate familial patterns， such as patients with Carney complex， the recurrence rate is 20%. Screening is recommended in first-degree relatives of patients with recurrent cardiac myxomas after surgical removal . Recurrence has been reported in cases with incomplete surgi-cal removal of the mass； close follow-up with echocardiogra-phy is necessary to ensure adequate tumor removal.\n\n【19】Conclusions\n\n【20】In summary， this is a case of a patient who initially presented with nonspecific dizziness and transient amnesia and was dis-covered to have CVA involving the cerebellar region secondary to cardiac myxoma. Cardiac myxoma is well known to be asso-ciated with systemic embolization. When the CNS is involved， it often manifests as signs and symptoms related to middle cerebral artery distribution. This case illustrates an uncommon presentation of cardiac myxoma involving posterior circulation. Such an atypical presentation can mask and delay workup for underlying stoke. Early recognition of the condition is crucial to prevent potentially life-threatening consequences. An echo cardiogram is a fast and noninvasive measure that should be pursued in an appropriate clinical setting when a cardioembol-ic source is suspected. Urgent surgical excision of the mass re-mains the definitive treatment. Delay in immediate interven-tion can result in severe thromboembolic complications. Regular long-term follow-up is necessary to monitor for recurrence. It is equally important to highlight that asymptomatic patients may consider a life-threatening condition benign if they lack an ad-equate understanding of the underlying pathology. Healthcare providers can play a crucial role in delivering appropriate infor-mation to help patients make informed and educated decisions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

This rare type of cancer represents about 0.1% of breast carcinomas. Recently， the World Health Organization defined this type of cancer as a separate entity from other breast cancer types. The diagnosis of this type of cancer in the breast is difficult because the histological pattern is similar to the small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of other more common primary sites of origin， including the lung.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 39-year-old woman presented to our hospital with a left breast mass and recurrent mastitis. Physical exami-nation revealed a painless lump in her left breast with a brown-colored discharge from the nipple， and her child refused breastfeeding from the left breast. A high-density well-defined rounded mass was observed upon mam-mography in the upper lateral aspect of the left breast. This mass lesion appeared hypoechoic with no poste-rior acoustic shadowingon ultrasound scan. A core-needle biopsy of the mass was performed and the diagno-sis of small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma was rendered after histopathologic examination. Positron emission tomography scanning was helpful in the exclusion of primary origin from other organ sites； thus， the primary breast origin of the tumor was confirmed.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】This case report provides a comprehensive approach to diagnose this type of small cell carcinoma originating primarily in the breast. The suspicion of this type of breast cancer should be raised if there is presence of char-acteristic histopathologic findings with the exclusion of any primary origin from other organ sites by the help of imaging studies.\n\n【6】Keywords： Breast Cancer 3· Carcinoma， Neuroendocrine · Carcinoma， Small Cell·Mammography\n\n【7】Small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma arises predominantly in the lung and can be found in other extra-pulmonary sites like the gastrointestinal (Gl) tract， larynx， breast， ovary， prostate， and cervix . This type of cancer is rarely found in the breast and it represents about 0.1% of primary breast cancers .\n\n【8】The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of breast tumors typifies primary small cell carcinoma and primary large cell carcinoma as poorly differentiated neuroendocrine breast carcinomas (NEBC) . The WHO defined 3 criteria to diagnose NEBC. The first one is when more than 50% of the tumor cells express 1 or more of the of the neuroendocrine markers. The second criterion is by excluding any primary cancer site in the body other than the breast by the use of imaging techniques other than mammography. The third method of diagnosis is by histopathologic testing of the breast when it shows carci-noma in situ .\n\n【9】The current case is interesting because the diagnosis of the primary origin of the tumor depended mainly on radiological features by excluding primary origin from other organ sites.\n\n【10】Case Report\n\n【11】Clinical Data\n\n【12】A 39-year-old female patient presented to the surgical clinic with a history of recurrent left breast mastitis and left breast brown discharge. She was doing well until 1 month prior to ad-mission to our hospital， when she noticed a growing left breast mass in the upper outer quadrant. This mass was painless and associated with brown-colored nipple discharge， which was not affected by the menstrual cycle and the skin of the breast ap peared normal. She had 5 children. She stated that she irreg-ularly breastfed her child from the right breast and the child refused to feed from the left breast. There was no family his-tory of breast cancer and no history of smoking or use of oral contraceptives. Her appetite was good， with no recent weight loss. She had no history of chronic diseases，trauma， or surgery.\n\n【13】Upon physical examination， a lump was found in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast and there was a brown-col-ored discharge from the nipple. There were no skin changes， retraction of the nipple， or prominent lymph nodes in the ax-illary region.\n\n【14】Radiological Findings\n\n【15】A digital mammogram showed a partially defined， spheri-cal， high-density mass lesion in the left breast upper lateralquadrant . In correlation with an ultrasound scan， this mass appeared to be well-defined large， irregular， and heterogeneously hypoechoic， with no posterior acoustic shadowing or enhancement. The mass was located at the 2：00o'clock position of the left breast， measuring 1.52x0.89 cm. An ultrasound-guided biopsy was done， which rendered a diagnosis of poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma (small cell carcinoma).\n\n【16】A metastatic workup， including computed tomography (CT) scans of chest， abdomen， pelvis， and brain， with intravenous contrast and positron emission tomography (PET) scan，showed only the left breast mass， with no evidence of metastasis or any other site of primary cancer .\n\n【17】Octreotide scanning is the most accurate imaging modality to exclude any other primary or metastatic site of neuroendo-crine tumors. In our case， we did not perform an octreotide scan because， in the multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting， it was decided that there is no need for further imaging and we depended mainly on PET scanning， as it is useful for identify-ing the aggressive and non-differentiated type of neuroendo-crine tumors， as in our case .\n\n【18】The patient underwent wide local excision of the left breast mass with axillary clearance. The patient received adjuvant che-motherapy with Cisplatinum 80 mg/m² on day 1 and Etoposide100 mg/m² on days 1， 2， and 3， every 3 weeks， for a total of 4cycles. The chemotherapy was well tolerated in general， with the exception of occasional mild bouts of nausea and vomiting. The patient also received adjuvant radiotherapy as 50 Gy/25fractions to the left breast， supraclavicular， and internal mam-mary lymph nodes. The patient became pregnant and had a normal vaginal delivery on January 16， 2021. She was doing very well clinically at the time of writing this report.\n\n【19】Microscopic Description\n\n【20】Histologic examination showed a high-grade malignant tumor composed of small round-to-oval and short spindle-shaped cells arranged in solid sheets and nests， where the tumor cell nuclei had a size less than 3 lymphocytes. These cells had lit-tle cytoplasm，salt-and-pepper chromatin， and showed no dis-tinct nucleoli. The tumor had an infiltrative border， with areas of necrosis and frequent mitoses .\n\n【21】With extensive sampling of the breast mass excision specimen， which showed the same tumor morphology as in the biopsy， a ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) was identified， with micro-papillary and cribriform growth patterns， and a nuclear grade best assigned as low to intermediate . The tumor size was 2.5 cm in greatest dimension (pT2) with 15 lymph nodes harvested， and 1 of them was involved by the tumor (pN1).\n\n【22】More than 50% of the tumor cells showed expression of neuro-endocrine markers (synaptophysin， chromogranin， and CD56)， consistent with primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the breast rather than high-grade invasive mammary carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation. The tumor exhibited dif-fuse， uniform， and strong expression of CD56 marker， diffuse and moderately intense positivity for synaptophysin marker， and diffuse and weak positivity for chromogranin marker； find-ings that support neuroendocrine differentiation. Also， TTF1marker exhibited the weak focal nuclear expression that is fre-quently seen in neuroendocrine carcinomas from any site， not just the lung. The Ki67 proliferation index was estimated to be positive in more than 60% of tumor cells . They were also positive for CK7， bcl2， and EMA markers， but were negative for pan-CK (AE1/AE3)， p63， CK5/6， GATA3， vimen-tin， c-kit， CD34， desmin， CD99， LCA， CD30， and CD138 mark-ers. Hormonal markers for estrogen receptor (ER) and proges-terone receptor (PR)， along with HER2-neu marker， were alsoperformed， and were negative. The reported DCIS component proved to be negative for the neuroendocrine markers synap-tophysin and CD56.\n\n【23】Discussion\n\n【24】Small cell cancer primarily originates from the lung， but it can also originate from different extra-pulmonary regions， in-cluding the Gl tract， urinary bladder， prostate， breast， cervix， and other sites . This type of cancer is rarely diagnosed in the breast， accounting for only 0.1% of all breast cancers .\n\n【25】Boutrid et al  collected data from the literature for all pa-tients diagnosed with primary breast small cell carcinoma un-til 2020， finding 6 cases； the age at diagnosis was 40-70 years and the stage of presentation was usually stage 3. Our case was at the younger end of this age range， at 39 years old.\n\n【26】Small cell carcinoma， whether the primary site is the breast or any other site of the body， the histopathologic features and im-munohistochemical findings are the same. Therefore， to diag-nose a primary breast small cell carcinoma we need to exclude if there is any other primary cancer outside the breast with the help of imaging studies， neuroendocrine differentiation not less than 50%， and/or presence of in situ carcinoma component his-tologically . A case reported by Adegbola et al  exhibited foci of an in situ component of neuroendocrine pattern which confirms the primary breast origin. As mentioned above， our case contained ductal carcinoma in situ component which， al-though negative for neuroendocrine markers， acted along with the radiological exclusion of other sites of involvemet to support primary breast origin of the tumor even with absence of posi-tivity for breast differentiation markers like ER， PR and GATA3. Shin et al  explained that hormonal markers' positivity was variable in the 9 cases in their study； both were expressed to-gether in 5 cases and both were negative in 3. Therefore，these markers are necessary to be performed and assessed， but their positivity is not mandatory to make the diagnosis. Also， 3 cases reported by Adegbola et al  were triple-negative.\n\n【27】Conclusions\n\n【28】This case report provides a comprehensive approach to diag-nosing this type of small cell carcinoma originating primarily in the breast. The suspicion of this type of breast cancer should be raised if there is presence of characteristic histopatholog-ic findings with the exclusion of any primary origin from oth-er organ sites by the help of imaging studies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The pathophysiology of this syndrome includes an accessory pathway connecting the atria and the atrio-ventricular (AV) node (James fiber)， or between the atria and the His bundle (Brechenmacher fiber). Similar features are seen in enhanced atrioventricular nodal conduction (EAVNC)， with the underlying pathophysiolo-gy due to a fast pathway to the AV node， and with the diagnosis requiring specific electrophysiologic criteria. A 17-year-old man presented with a history of recurrent narrow-complex and wide-complex tachycardia on electrocardiogram (ECG). An electrophysiologic study showed an unusually short atrial to His (AH) conduction interval and a normal His to ventricle (HV) interval， without a delta wave. Two stable AH intervals coexisted in the same atrial pacing cycle length. In the recovery curve study this pathway had a flat conduction curve with-out an AH increase until the last 60 ms， before reaching the effective refractory period. These ECG changes did not respond to an adenosine challenge. When this pathway became intermittent， there was a paradoxicalre-sponse to adenosine challenge with conduction via a short AH interval， but without conduction block. Catheter ablation of the AV nodal region resulted in a normalized AH interval， decremental conduction properties， and resulted in a positive response to an adenosine challenge.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】In this case of Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome， electrophysiologic studies supported the role of the accessory pathway of James fibers.\n\n【5】MeSH Keywords： Accessory Atrioventricular Bundle · Catheter Ablation·Lown-Ganong-Levine SyndromeLown-Ganong-Levine syndrome， with the electrocardiographic(ECG) findings of a short PR interval， a normal QRS complex， and paroxysmal tachycardia， was first described in 1938 ， and was further characterized by Lown， Ganong， and Levine in 1952 . The proposed pathophysiology of Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome involves accessory pathway connections be-tween the atria and low atrioventricular (AV) node， as described by James in 1961 ， or between the atria and the His bun-dle， as described by Brechenmacher in 1975 . Similar elec-trophysiologic findings with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and without a delta wave are seen in enhanced atrioventricu-lar nodal conduction (EAVNC)， with the underlying pathophys-iology due to a fast pathway to the AV node， and with the di-agnosis requiring specific electrophysiologic criteria. The ECG findings in EAVNC include a short atrial to His (AH) conduction interval of <60 ms during sinus rhythm， intact AV conduction with a short atrial paced cycle length of <300 ms， and a small AH increment of <100 ms as paced atrial cycle length is de-creased to 300 ms .\n\n【6】The clinical and electrophysiologic features of a case of recur-rent narrow-complex and wide-complex tachycardia on elec-trocardiogram (ECG)， in a 17-year-old man， are presented. The features of Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome are compared with those of EAVNC and included analysis of the AV nodal recovery curves obtained before and after adenosine challenge and cryo-ablation. The findings in this single case，including the short PR and AH interval， may be due to an accessory pathway connec-tion from the atrium to the distal AV node (James fiber)， rath-er than enhanced atrioventricular nodal conduction (EAVNC).\n\n【7】A 17-year-old man presented to our institution with a history of recurrent narrow-complex and wide-complex tachycardia. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)  showed a short PR interval (0.10 sec)， a normal QRS complex， and otherwise normal ECG intervals and voltages. A previous electrophysio-logic study at 16 years-of-age demonstrated both antegrade and retrograde dual AV nodal pathways， with pacing-induc-ible slow and fast AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia. Extensive radiofrequency ablation of the proximal coronary sinus and the right posteroseptal tricuspid annulus area were unsuc-cessful at that time.\n\n【8】On his recent hospital admission， the electrophysiologic stud-ies showed an extremely short baseline atrial to His (AH) con-duction interval of 22 ms， and a normal His to ventricle (HV) interval， without a delta wave . Adenosine， 0.3 mg/kg intravenously (Ⅳ)， did not change the AH interval. Rapid atri-al pacing at cycle lengths of 330-300 ms showed stable 1：1antegrade conduction and two steady AH intervals， indicating two conduction pathways： a conduction pathway with short AH， presumed to be a James fiber， and an AV nodal pathway with long AH. At pacing cycle length 280 ms with stable 1：1AV conduction the PR interval was longer than the RR intervals， indicating the presence of antegrade dual AV nodal pathways(fast and slow AV nodal pathways). AV nodal Wenckebach block occurred at atrial pacing cycle length of 270 ms.\n\n【9】In atrial extra-stimuli， the AV nodal (AVN) conduction (A1A2-A2H2) recovery curves pre-James fiber ablation plot  showed that from A1A2 550-420 ms， there was a flat AH with-out decrement. When the A1A2 further decreased to 350 ms. A2H2 increased from 35-77 ms (with a decremental property).\n\n【10】When the A1A2 decreased from 350-340 ms， there was an A2H2 jump of 31 ms (from 77-118 ms). When A1A2 was fur-ther decreased， A2H2 gradually increased to 270 ms without a further jump.\n\n【11】The retrograde ventriculoatrial (VA) conduction had decremen-tal properties. Ventricular pacing at a pacing cycle length of600 ms showed a VA conduction of 120 ms with the earliest atrial depolarization at His bundle region. In ventricular ex-trastimuli， the VA conduction progressively lengthened to 181ms， then jumped to 330 ms， with the earliest retrograde atrial conduction that shifted to the coronary sinus ostium， which induced a retrograde， slow-antegrade， fast AV nodal re-entry. With isoproterenol challenge， which is a sympathomimetic for beta-receptors， ventricular pacing induced a sustained fast-slow AV nodal reentrant tachycardia with an AH of 71 ms and HA of 180 ms and the earliest retrograde atrial depolarization was recorded at the area of the ostium of the coronary sinus.\n\n【12】A Freezor Xtra@ ablation catheter (Medtronic， Kirkland， Quebec， Canada) was used for mapping and cardiac ablation applied to the posterior septal area close to the coronary sinus. Catheter manipulation at the upper mid-septal area incidentally result-ed in transient AH prolongation (mechanical ablation of the James fiber). Cryoablation at -80℃ delivered to this site for4 minutes， followed by an additional cryoablation of 22 sec-onds (which was stopped due to transient AV block) resulted in a normalized basic AH interval to 56 ms.\n\n【13】The A1A2-A2H2 plot post-James fiber ablation  showed that from A1A2 600 ms to 350 the A2H2 conduction curve had a decremental property， which was significantly dif-ferent from that of the pre-ablation curve. From A1A2 340 to170 the two recovery curves were superimposable， and this was presumed to be the James fiber effective refractory peri-od. A repeat adenosine challenge， at the same dose， resultedin transient AV conduction block. However， the James fiber conduction recurred with an intermittent short AH of 33 ms. which was longer than the baseline AH of 22 ms， and a long AH of 50 ms. Adenosine challenge of 0.3 mg/kg intravenous-ly resulted in a paradoxical response of constant short AH of33 ms with loss of the long AH interval.\n\n【14】Cryoablation commenced at the level of the mid-coronary si-nus ostium and continued superiorly， finally eliminated the retrograde slow AV nodal pathway at the right lower midsep-tal area above the coronary sinus ostium. Post-ablation rapid atrial pacing resulted in a PRinterval that was shorter than the RR interval before AV nodal Wenckebach block. The post-slow pathway ablation recovery curve， with recurrence of the Jamesfiber  showed the superimposable recovery curve from A1A2 600 to 350 ms compared with that of the pre-James fi-ber ablation curve. At A1A2 ≤340 ms， the James fiber effective refractory period， the recovery curve post-slow pathway ab-lation had a shorter A2H2 at the same A1A2 (downward dis placement) compared with that of the pre-slow pathway ab-lation curve. There was no demonstrable retrograde slow AV nodal pathway conduction and no inducible AV nodal re-entry with or without isoproterenol challenge. At one-year follow-up， there was no clinical recurrence of tachycardia in this patient.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】In this case， the clinical and electrophysiologic characteristics were consistent with a diagnosis of Lown-Ganong-Levine syn-drome， with a short PR interval， normal QRS complex， without a delta wave， and paroxysmal tachycardia. This case had the fea-tures described by James， as an accessory pathway connection from the atrium to the distal AV node . The findings in this case included an unusually short atrium to His (AH) conduction interval and a normal His to ventricle (HV) conduction interval without a delta wave； two different stable AH intervals coex-isted at the same atrial pacing cycle length； and in the A1A2-A2H2 recovery curve study， this pathway had a flat conduction curve without AH increase until the last 60 ms before reaching its effective refractory period. When decremental conduction occurred， this pathway showed no response to the adenosine challenge， and when this pathway became intermittent， there was a paradoxical response to adenosine challenge with con-duction via a short AH instead of lengthening AH or conduction block. Finally， catheter ablation at the AV nodal region result-ed in a normalized AH interval， normal decremental conduc-tion， and resulted in a positive response to adenosine challenge.\n\n【17】In this case， since this pathway had some decremental prop-erties， it is possible that the distal insertion site of this path-way was in the distal AV nodal area (James fiber) rather than connecting via the atria and the His bundle (Brechenmacher fiber) .\n\n【18】The James fiber in this patient appeared to be a bystander， which was not a tachycardia substrate. The clinical fast and slow AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia utilized an antegrade nor-mal AV nodal pathway and a retrograde slow AV nodal path-way. Therefore， after the James fiber recurrence， further abla-tion was not pursued. Instead， the retrograde slow AV nodal pathway was eventually ablated successfully at the right low-er mid septal area above the coronary sinus ostium.\n\n【19】When comparing the pre-and post-James fiber ablation A1A2-A2H2 recovery curves， the former had a faster conduction(shorter AH)， a reduced decremental conduction property (anunchanged A2H2 until A1A2 <410 ms， and then the A2H2started to lengthen)， and a longer effective refractory peri-od. When the James fiber became refractory (at A1A2 of 340ms)， the conduction continued through the AV nodal path-way with similar pre- and post-ablation curves， that were al-most superimposable.\n\n【20】Comparison of the post-James fiber ablation recovery curve with that of the post-slow pathway ablation curve with James fiber recurrence， it was noted that when the A1A2 was less than350 ms， the post-slow pathway ablation curve (fast AV nodal conduction curve) deviated downward from that of the pre-James fiber ablation curve (slow pathway conduction curve). Therefore， the pre-james fiber ablation curve was a hybrid of a James fiber and a slow AV nodal pathway conduction curve； the post-James fiber ablation curve was a hybrid of fast and slow AV noda! conduction curve， and the post-slow pathway ablation curve was a hybrid of the James fiber and fast AV nodal conduction curve.\n\n【21】This case also fulfilled the diagnosis criteria of enhanced atrio-ventricular nodal conduction (EAVNC)， which requires the pres-ence of a short AH interval (≤60 ms) during sinus rhythm， and intact AV sequential conduction to short atrial paced cycle length (≤300 ms)， and a small increment (≤100 ms) in the AH interval as the atrial cycle length decreased to 300 ms . The diagnosis of EAVNC implies that the underlying patholo-gy is due to a distal atrial insertion to the AV node or the fast pathway input to the AV node interposed by less AV nodal tis-sue than normal， before entering the His bundle. If this were the case， when this EAVNC was injured during catheter manip-ulation and by catheter ablation (with intermittent AH prolon-gation)， adenosine should have resulted in a further length-ening of the AH or caused AV block. Instead， the normal AV nodal pathway was blocked， resulting in the paradoxical re-sponse of constant short AH intervals.\n\n【22】The differential diagnosis between the small AV node show-ing properties of EAVNC and the presence of the anatomical-ly independent James fiber can be quite difficult. If the James fiber had retrograde AV conduction， it would have been pos-sible to also evaluate the anatomical difference in the atrial insertion site between the James fiber and the fast AV nodal pathway. Unfortunately， this case showed no evidence of ret-rograde AV conduction through the James fiber.\n\n【23】Tachycardia is one of the features of Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome. However， in our case， the patient’s tachycardia was caused by a slow AV nodal pathway， and the James fiber appeared to be a bystander for this effect. Similar to Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome， Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome can result in serious cardiac arrhythmias， atrial fibrillation， several syncope episodes， and even sudden death .\n\n【24】In 2001， a clinical study of children and young adults included273 cases of sudden death， in which out of ten cases of ventric-ular pre-excitation (3.6%； mean age， 24 years) there were eight cases of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (short PR interval， wide QRS， and a delta wave) and two cases of Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome (short PR interval and normal QRS complex-es) . In the two cases of Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome， one case had a hypoplastic atrioventricular node， likely to have been caused by EAVNC， and the other had Brechenmacher fibers(atrio-Hisian tracts)； of the cases of Wolff-Parkinson-White syn-drome， sudden cardiac death was related to a very short ante-grade effective refractory period of the accessory pathway .\n\n【25】Since the tachycardia in this case was caused by fast and slow AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia and the antegrade ef-fective refractory period of the James fiber was relatively long(340 ms)， in retrospect， there may have been no need to ab-late the James fiber in this case. However， attempted cryoab-lation ofthe James fiber proved its presence. Since the Jamesfiber is close to the normal AV nodal tissue， cryoablation， with its reversibility in case of an adverse event of AV block， should be used if necessary.\n\n【26】Conclusions\n\n【27】This single case report is of Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome associated with accessory pathway (James fiber) conduction， but this single case does not attempt to apply this finding to the cause in all cases of this syndrome. With the increasing use of the cardiac electrophysiologic studies and catheter ab-lation in the evaluation of patients with cardiac pre-excita-tion syndromes， it is likely that more cases of Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome will be studied. An awareness of the clinical and electrophysiologic features of Lown-Ganong-Levine syn-drome will assist the cardiologist and electrophysiologist in making the correct diagnosis and may add further insight into the pathophysiology of this syndrome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

When considering PEComas of the female genital tract， the uterus is the most common location. Involvement of the ovary in the context of a primary uterine PEComa， in the absence of systemic disease associated with tuberous sclerosis， however， has only been reported in 1 pre-vious case.\n\n【2】Case Report： We report a case of a PEComa of the uterus with metastasis to the left ovary in a 61-year-old Caucasian wom-an. Gross examination of the uterus revealed a 10.7×10.5x10.2 cm tan-brown， mostly solid， partially cystic mass. Microscopic examination showed epithelioid cells with clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm， arranged in fas-cicles. Intranuclear pseudoinclusions were also noted. The tumor cells were smooth muscle actin， caldesmon， and desmin positive (diffuse)； HMB-45 positive (focal)； and Melan-A， AE1/AE3， CD10， and 5100 negative by immunohistochemistry.\n\n【3】Conclusions： Distinguishing among mesenchymal neoplasms， including PEComas， endometrial stromal sarcomas， and leio-myosarcomas， can be difficult. Careful analysis of morphologic and immunohistochemical features is of the ut-most importance. Differential diagnosis， including morphologic features and immunohistochemical patterns， is also discussed.\n\n【4】MeSH Keywords： Ovarian Neoplasms ·Perivascular Epithelioid Cell Neoplasms·Uterine Neoplasms\n\n【5】Perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) are a rare group of mesenchymal neoplasms composed of epithelioid cells， in a perivascular distribution， that express both melanocytic and smooth muscle markers and contain eosinophilic to clear granular cytoplasm. PEComas can occur at any anatomic site and include angiomyolipomas， lymphangioleiomyomatosis， clear cell “sugar\"tumors of the lung， and PEComa not other-wise specified \n\n【6】In the female genital tract， the uterus is the most common lo-cation for PEComas， with 78 reported cases to date .Ovarian PEComas are exceptionally rare， with only 1 reported prima-ry case  and 6 reports of PEComa metastatic to the ova-ries . Four of these 6 metastatic cases were associated with tuberous sclerosis and had multiorgan involvement in-cluding the ovary . Of the 2 remaining cases that were not associated with tuberous sclerosis， one reported a jejunal PEComa with metastasis to the pelvic wall and ovary  and the other described a primary uterine PEComa with involve-ment of the ovary . Here， we report the second published case of a primary uterine PEComa with involvement of the left ovary in a 61-year-old woman.\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】A 61-year-old Caucasian woman presented with a 3-month history of a firm， nontender enlargement of the abdomen and a palpable abdominal mass in the absence of other gastroin-testinal or genitourinary symptoms. At the time of her annu-al examination， 7 months previously， she had no symptoms and no palpable mass. The patient had no history of tuber ous sclerosis. Her past medical history included leiomyomas with endometrial ablation at age 47. Her family history was significant for a mother with breast cancer diagnosed at age59. Physical examination showed a firm， irregular， and en-larged uterus. A pelvic ultrasound identified a 10.5x9×12 cm mass adjacent to the superior aspect of the uterus， and com-puted tomography (CT) of the pelvis characterized the mass as complex， cystic， and with septations. Serologic evaluation， including a complete blood count， comprehensive metabolic panel， and CA-125 study， was remarkable only for a mild ane-mia with a hemoglobin of 11.6 g/dL.\n\n【9】The patient underwent hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Macroscopic examination of the uterus showed a 10.7x10.5×10.2 cm solid， tan-brown mass in the fundus. The mass was partially filled with blood-tinged fluid and was coarse-ly trabeculated.No gross abnormalities of the fallopian tubes or ovaries were noted. The intraoperative diagnosis was de-termined to be a low-grade spindle-cell mesenchymal lesion.\n\n【10】A follow-up positron emission tomography/CT scan， performed approximately 6 months after tumor resection， was negative for tumor recurrence and metastatic disease.\n\n【11】On microscopic examination， the uterine tumor was densely cellular， with epithelioid cells arranged in fascicles. Moderate nuclear atypia was also present with 1 to 2 mitotic figures per10 high-power field (HPF). The tumor was biphasic in nature and without necrosis. Some cells contained a clear-granular cytoplasm， whereas others had an eosinophilic cytoplasm.A vascular network was also evident， with cells arranged radial-ly around blood vessels. Many intranuclear pseudoinclusions were also present . The tumor exhibited pushing bor-ders into the myometrium. Tumor cells of the same morphol-ogy were also present in the left ovary .\n\n【12】Immunohistochemistry indicated that tumor cells were calde-smon， smooth muscle actin (SMA)， and desmin positive ， as well as focally positive for melanoma-associ-ated antigen (HMB-45). Tumor cells were cytokeratin AE1/AE3， CD10，Melan-A，and S-100 negative.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】In this study， we report a case of a uterine PEComa with left ovarian involvement in the absence of systemic disease asso-ciated with tuberous sclerosis. The patient had minimal symp-toms and was found to have a uterine mass by CT scan. The tumor was characterized by epithelioid cell morphology， with cells radiating around a delicate capillary network and pos-sessing a clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm. Cells with spider cell-like morphology and cells containing intranuclear pseudoin-clusions were also identified. Tumor cells exhibited moderate atypia， including variability in size and shape， and frequent prominent nucleoli. Immunohistochemistry revealed expres-sion of the melanocytic marker HMB-45 and the smooth mus-cle markers SMA， desmin， and caldesmon. These morphologic features and the immunohistochemical staining pattern sup-ported a diagnosis of PEComa.\n\n【15】In the only other reported case of primary uterine PEComa with ovarian involvement， the patient had vaginal bleeding and was found to have a large uterine mass by CT scan . The mass was significantly larger than in the current case，measur-ing 30x27x18 cm in comparison with 10.7x10.5x10.2 cm. On microscopic examination，tumor cells displayed similar mor-phology to cells in the tumor of the current case . The tumor was also composed of epithelioid cells containing clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm and arranged in fascicules. Immunohistochemistry was similar as well， with cells show-ing positive reactivity to both melanocytic and smooth muscle markers including HMB-45， SMA， and caldesmon .\nfor HMB-45.

The origin of PEComas is unknown， but it has been hypothesized that these tumors arise from neural crest stem cells and possess the ability to differentiate into both myoid and melanocytic cells . To date， there have been 78 reported cases of uterine PEComas， the most com-mon site in the female genital tract.\n\n【21】PEComas express both melanocytic and smooth muscle mark-ers. In a recent review HMB-45 was found to be the most com-mon melanocytic marker of uterine PEComas， with positive re-sults in 99% (77/78) of reported cases . Additionally， SMA was determined to be the most common smooth muscle mark-er， with positive results in 80% (53/68) of uterine PEComas. In the current case， the tumor was focally positive for HMB-45 and diffusely positive for SMA.\n\n【22】When considering a mesenchymal neoplasm of the uterus， leiomyosarcoma， endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS)， andPEComas must all be considered. Distinguishing among these can be challenging and requires both morphologic and immu-nohistochemical evidence for diagnosis . Morphologic features such as the identification of a capillary network are of particular importance in distinguishing between mesenchymal neoplasms. Leiomyosarcomas lack a capillary network， and al-though a capillary network is often present in ESS， the capil-laries lack the radial appearance of epithelioid cells character-istic of PEComas. Although PEComas are most commonly positive for melanocytic markers， cases of both leiomyosar-coma and ESS tumors expressing HMB-45 have been report-ed . However， the absence of CD10 expression can pro-vide evidence against ESS， which has been shown to express CD10 in 96% of cases. In contrast， CD10 expression is rare in both PEComas and leiomyosarcomas .\n\n【23】The age of patients affected by uterine PEComas varies widely from 9 to 79， with an average age of 45 . Presenting symp-toms are often vague and include postmenopausal or abnor-mal bleeding and abdominal pain. In the current case， the only presenting symptom was a palpable abdominal mass. Although PEComas are often benign， there have been reported cases of malignant tumors. To distinguish between benign and malig-nant uterine PEComas， the Folpe criteria are often used . According to the Folpe criteria， a tumor is considered malig-nant if it contains at least 2 worrisome features， defined as size of at least 5 cm， high nuclear grade and cellularity， a mi-totic rate of at least 1 per 50 HPF and necrosis or vascular in-vasion. In 2015， a modification of the Folpe criteria was pro-posed， defining malignant tumors as those containing any necrosis or at least 1 worrisome feature， defined as an inva-sive edge， size of at least 5 cm， a mitotic rate of at least 2 to3 per 50 HPF， and lymphovascular invasion.\n\n【24】In the current case， we determined the PEComa to be of ag-gressive potential because moderate nuclear atypia was pres ent， the size was greater than 5 cm， and the mitotic rate was greater than 1 mitotic figure per HPF， thus fulfilling both theFolpe and the modified Folpe criteria. The left ovarian metas-tasis also supported a diagnosis of malignancy. The most com-mon sites of metastasis of PEComas are lung， followed by liver， lymph nodes， and peritoneum . In contrast， PEComa me-tastasis to the ovaries is rare， with only 6 reported cases， the majority of which have been associated with multiorgan in-volvement in the context of tuberous sclerosis. To our knowledge， this is only the second reported case of a prima-ry uterine PEComa with ovarian involvement in the absence of tuberous sclerosis. The clinical consequences of ovarian in-volvement are still unknown. In the current case， the patient underwent resection of all gross disease by total hysterecto-my and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy； however， recurrence may still be a possibility\n\n【25】There is no established treatment protocol for uterine PEComas. Hysterectomy is the current treatment of choice， but long-term outcomes remain unclear. As a result， close follow-up is nec-essary for all patients diagnosed with PEComas and is espe-cially important for those diagnosed with PEComas of malig-nant potential.\n\n【26】Conclusions\n\n【27】PEComas are a rare group of neoplasms that are difficult to differentiate from other mesenchymal tumors. Careful exami-nation of morphologic features and immunohistochemistry are necessary for accurate diagnosis. Of PEComas occurring in the female genital tract， the uterus is the most common location； involvement of the ovaries is quite rare. No established ther-apy protocol exists， and additiona. research is needed to de-termine the best treatment for these neoplasms.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Postoperative cholangiography revealed leakage from the left hepatic duct near the caudate branch.\n\n【4】Conclusions： There are a few reports of spontaneous bile duct perforation cases in the literature， particularly on infants or children with congenital anomalies， but it is rare in adults. It usually causes bile peritonitis， although bile duct perforation should be considered in the differential diagnosis of spontaneous retroperitoneal fluid collection in aduts.\n\n【5】MeSH Keywords： Bile Ducts， Intrahepatic · Retroperitoneal Space ·Rupture， SpontaneousSpontaneous perforation of the bile duct is very rare in adults. Most of the bile duct ruptures usually occur secondly to blunt or penetrating abdominal traumas， hepatobiliary operations， and instrumentation， and is more often seen in infants and children . Patients with bile duct rupture mostly present with acute symptoms， fulminant bile peritonitis with pain， vom-iting， fever， and abdominal distention. However， retroperito-neal biloma due to spontaneous perforation of the bile duct is very rare. Spontaneous perforation of the bile duct is diffi-cult to diagnose preoperatively. Most patients are preopera-tively diagnosed as having cholecystitis or choledochocystitis. These prognoses are inaccurate due to the prolonged dura-tion of the symptoms .\n\n【6】Here， we report a patient with retroperitoneal biloma as are-sult of perforation of the left hepatic duct that was success-fully treated with surgical intervention.\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】An 82-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our institution due to abdominal pain lasting for 3 days and a high fever. He had a past medical history of emphysema， asthma， unstable angina， and gastric ulcer perforation for which he underwent an operation. He was an ex-smoker and daily drinker (2 cans of beer a day). He had a temperature of 38.7℃. An abdomi-nal examination revealed distention and tenderness from the right hypochondrium to the midline. On laboratory examina-tion， WBC was 14 700/mm?， CRP was 29.4 mg/dl， total bil-irubin was 2.2 mg/dl， AST and ALT were normal， yGTP was220 IU/l， Cre was 1.44 mg/dl， and the myocardial marker level was normal. Although we performed an abdominal ultrasound examination， the upper right quadrant was nearly impossible to clearly visualize because of the presence of intestinal gas.\n\n【9】A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed several stones in the gallbladder (GB) and common bile duct (CBD) and retro-peritoneal fluid collection extending from the dorsal stratum of the duodenum and pancreas head to the right paracolic space and anterior side of the right iliopsoas. There was no dilata tion of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct .\n\n【10】Hemorrhage to retroperitoneal stratum， damage of the duo-denum， and spread of colitis or appendicitis were considered in the differential diagnosis of the lesion. Our patient was el-derly and had severe inflammation； therefore， we elected to perform a laparotomy.\n\n【11】We performed a median incisional laparotomy. There were a few ascites. The GB had a thick wall but was not perforated. After the mobilization of the pancreas head， duodenum， and right side of the colon， a substantial amount of bile was found. We sus-pected that perforation of the bile duct had occurred. Therefore， we exfoliated the dorsal side of CBD to the cranial side， and intraoperative cholangiography was performed. However， the site of perforation could not be detected. Additionally， we per-formed an intraoperative choledochoscopy， although the per-forated site could not be found. Cholecystectomy and choledo-cholithotomy were performed， a retrograde transhepatic biliary drainage tube (RTBD tube) was inserted， and primary closure of the incision site of the CBD was achieved. After intraperi-toneal irrigation with 5 L of saline， we inserted drains to the right paracolic gutter and Winslow’s foramen.\n\n【12】In the postoperative course， we performed cholangiography， which revealed a leakage from the left hepatic duct near the caudate branch . On postoperative day 5， the patient had a fever that reached 38.6C and a high inflammation score upon laboratory examination. A CT scan revealed an abscess formation that was remaining at the ventral side of the infe-rior vena cava and right iliopsoas . We adjusted the drain in Winslow's foramen further inside to improve drainageof bile spillage from the left hepatic duct and the drain at the right paracolic gutter further caudally with a use of a guide wire， and the patient gradually recovered. On postoperative day 30， the RTBD tube was withdrawn following a cholangi-ography that revealed no leakage from the biliary duct. At a6-month follow-up examination， the patient was in good health， and the laboratory examination revealed normal liver function.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Spontaneous perforation of the bile duct in adults unrelated to iatrogenic injury or severe trauma is extremely rare and ismore often seen in infants and children . Freeland re-ported the first case of spontaneous perforation of the hepat-ic duct in 1882， diagnosed during an autopsy . The most common perforation site of the biliary tract is the GB and the cause is typically cholecystitis and cholecystolithiasis .Other perforation sites are the intrahepatic bile duct and extrahe-patic bile duct. To date， 23 cases of intrahepatic bile duct per-forations and 54 cases of extrahepatic bile duct perforation in adults have been reported . Several causes of spon-taneous perforation of bile duct have been proposed： ero-sion by biliary stones that injured the duct wall；  increased intraductal pressure due to an obstruction of the distal bile duct (by stones， carcinomas， or a reflux spasm of the sphinc-ter of Oddi)；  thrombosis of a vessel supplying the bile duct wall；  intramural infection of the duct as a result of chol-angitis；  regurgitation of pancreatic secretions into the bile duct；  diverticulitis of the bile duct； and  acute pancre-atitis.\n\n【15】The most common perforation site is the CBD. Bile duct perfo-ration presents as either a localized fluid collection or gener-alized biliary peritonitis. Therefore， only a few cases that have described the presence of fluid collection in retroperitoneum space in spontaneous perforation of the bile duct have been published. To date， only 6 cases of spontaneous perforation of the bile duct with retroperitoneal fluid collection have been reported . It is very difficult to diagnose a sponta-neous perforation of the bile duct presenting with retroperi-toneal fluid collection preoperatively. In this case， the preop-erative diagnosis could not be obtained， and an emergency laparotomy was performed. Ifthe preoperative diagnosis had been obtained， an endoscopic retrograde cholangiogram could have been performed.\n\n【16】According to the surgical treatment， the repair of the perfo-ration site and T-tube insertion was most frequently report-ed . In our case， an accurate site of the perforation could not be detected. Therefore， we performed the insertion of a retrograde transhepatic biliary drainage tube. If there is a large defect， a more invasive operative method should be con-sidered， such as a hepaticojejunostomy， hepatoduodenostomy or flap patch . Appropriate and careful drainage via the insertion of drains is very important， particularly in cases with retroperitoneal fluid collection， because it is difficult due to the narrow space. In this case， the position of the drain， which was located on the dorsum of the duodenum and pancreas head， was slightly shallow； therefore， we had to reposition it.\n\n【17】Spontaneous perforation of the bile duct presenting retroper-itoneal fluid collection is an extremely rare and potentially fa-tal condition. It is very important to consider it in the differ-ential diagnosis whenever retroperitoneal fluid collection is present without an air bubble.\n\n【18】Declaration of interests\n\n【19】Kenjiro Ishii and other co-authors have no conflict of inter-est to declare.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "3d756f2b-44f9-4b13-934f-32f7844a8d99", "title": null, "text": "【0】ABSTRACT Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a potentially life-threatening consequence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection characterized by a hyperinflammatory state， leading to multi-organ damage that often requires hospitalization. Though the precise underlying etiopathogenesis of MIS-C is not completely com-prehended， the correlation between MIS-C and COVID-19 infection implies a delayed immune response dysregulation in the post- COVID-19 infection setting. MIS-C patients may have a wide spectrum of manifestations， including fever， elevated inflammatory parameters and signs of end organ damage， myocarditis， cardiac dysfunction， gastrointestinal manifestations， respiratory impairment， acute kidney injury， and/or hematologic， dermatologic and/or neurological involvement. Although MIS-C may overlap with other well-understood hyperinflammatory conditions such as secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (SHLH) in several Clinical features and laboratory findings， striking manifestations， including Gastrointestinal and cardiac ones， make the direction of the diagnostic compass geared more towards MIS-C which are unusual components of the disease process in SHLH. Besides that， MIS-C can be distinguished from SHLH in the amplitude and severity of hyperinflammation， which are more pronounced in SHLH. Because of the overlap， diagnosis of MIS-C requires a high clinical index as prompt recognition and early intervention have favourable prognostic outcomes. We herein report a 5-year-old male child patient who presented with overlapping features between MIS-C and SHLH in a post-COVID-19 setting.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children， secondary Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis， COVID-19，hyperinflammation\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a recently recognized condition caused by COVID-19. The first case was described in April 2020. It is characterized by a state of the hyperactive but ineffective immune system， resulting in multiple organ damage. The underlying pathogenesis and presentation are similar to other hyperinflammatory conditions like secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (SHLH) and Kawasaki disease.\n\n【4】Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare and potentially fatal disease marked by a widespread severe inflam-matory process affecting multiple organ systems accompanied by overactivation of the immune system and massive release of inflammatory mediators. HLH is categorized into hered-itary and acquired typesThe vast majority of hereditary types have genetic mutations in different genes， including per-forin (PRF1)， Munc (UNC13D)， and syntaxin (STX11，STXBP2) genes. Meanwhile， acquired types may result from a variety of pathologies such as infectious causes， malignant conditions， and rheumatological diseasesThe first case of HLH was reported by Scott and Robb-Smith in 1939. The diagnosis of HLH is based on the HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria， by either molecular evidence associated with HLH or fulfilment of five or more of eight clinical and laboratory measures.\n\n【5】Many of the clinical features and laboratory findings of MIS-C were similar to those of SHLH， which raised questions about the possibility of overlapping the two disorders. Although these similarities between both conditions， the presence of gas-trointestinal and cardiac manifestations directed the diagnosis toward MIS-C rather than SHLH. Therefore， prompt identification and early intervention are critical， as delaved di-agnosis and treatment are associated with poor prognostic out-comes. We herein report a 5-year-old male child patient who presented with overlapping features between MIS-C and SHLH in a post-COVID-19 setting.\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】K.D.， A 5-year-old Palestinian male patient with a free medical history except for an uneventful COVID -19 infection 5 weeks ago. The patient transferred to us from a peripheral hospital and was afterwards admitted on April 11th，2022， to assess measured fever (38.9 c) for 9 days associated with abdominal pain， de-creased appetite， and generalized weakness. He had consulted his general practitioner 7 days prior to admission. He has been prescribed antibiotics for tonsilitis， ibuprofen， acetaminophen， and ice packs without significant improvement.\n\n【8】Upon admission， Physical assessment showed critically ill and pale. Tachypneic patient with blood pressure (BP) of 88/58mmHg， heart rate (HR) of 130 bpm， oxygen saturation of 98% on room air， Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of 15， decreased air entry bilaterally in the basis of the lung， the abdomen was distended without tenderness， rigidity or guarding. The spleen was en-larged， measuring 13 cm. The patient has petechial rash and bruises on both lower limbs， gingival bleeding， and hyperemic throat with petechia on the hard palate. Cardiac auscultation re-vealed normal S1 and S2 without additional sounds or murmurs. Initial laboratory evaluation revealed severe pancytopenia with Hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.2 g/dl， White blood cells (WBCs) of 2，900/mm3， platelets of 7.6 10/ul， C-reactive protein of 9 mg/dL， procalcitonin of 1.78 ng/dl Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 1451 U/L， Alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) of 178.3 U/L， ferritin of 60930 ng/dl， fibrinogen of 130 mg/d1. Serological tests showed COVID-19 IgG positive. Blood and urine cultures were negative. Brain neuroimaging was unremarkable. Based on clin-ical manifestations and laboratory findings (table1)， the patient was suspected of having secondary hemophagocytic lymphohis-tiocytosis (SHLH). Therefore， genetic studies and bone marrow biopsy were V WE performed， which were normal. A whole body computed tomography (CT) scan showed bilateral pleural effu-sion， large ascites， splenomegaly， and diffuse lymphadenopathy.\n\n【9】Echocardiography revealed changes consistent with my-ocarditis and moderate ventricular dilation with trace pericar-dial effusion. Given free bone marrow biopsy， normal genetic analysis， prominent gastrointestinal manifestations， and car-diac dysfunction， the diagnosis is more likely to be directed towards Multiple inflammatory syndromes in children (MIS-C).

Children with MIS-C usually presented with fever lasting 3-5 days， significant cardiac impairment， gastrointestinal， pulmonary， renal， central nervous system， and skin manifestations. Although the exact underlying etiopathogenesis of MIS-C remains unclear， it seems to be due to an exaggerated immune response against the COVID-19 virus. Based on the CDC case definition of MIS-C， the patient must meet all of the following criteria：  age <21 years，(2A) fever ≥ 38.0 for at least 24-h℃， (2B) Severe illness necessi-tating hospitalization， and (2c)≥2 organ systems affected (i.e.， cardiac， renal， respiratory， hematologic， gastrointestinal， derma-tologic， neurological)，  Laboratory evidence of inflammation(e.g. high CRP，ESR) Laboratory or epidemiologic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Positive SARS-CoV-2 testing by RT-PCR， serology， or antigen OR COVID-19 exposure within 4 weeks prior to onset of symptoms) and  No alternative diagnosis. The diagnosis of MIS-C is challenging because of clinical and laboratory findings overlapping with other conditions such as secondary Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (SHLH)， toxic shock syndrome (TSS)， and Macrophage activation syndrome(MAS) and Kawasaki disease(KD).\n\n【12】Table 1 Laboratory dataoglobin， PLT： platelet， WBC： white blood cell， CRP： C-reactive protein， ESR： Erythrocyte sedimentation rate， PCT： procalcitonin， LDH： lactate dehydrogenase， AST： aspartate aminotransferase， ALT： alanine aminotransferase，CRE：creatinine， BUN： blood urea nitrogen， UA： uric acid， PT： prothrombin time， PTT： partial thromboplastin.\n\n| Laboratory parameter  | The value  | Reference range  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Complete blood count (CBC)  |  |  |\n| ·Hb(g/dl)  | 9.24  | 11-12.9  |\n| PLT (\\*10)/p1  | 7.6  | 142-450  |\n| ·WBC(\\*10°)/L  | 2.92  | 4-11000  |\n| ·Neutrophil count/pl  | 800  | 2500-7000  |\n| Inflammatory markers  |  |  |\n| ·CRP(mg/dl)  | 9  | 0-5  |\n| ·ESR (mm/hour)  | 10  | 0-10  |\n| ·PCT(ng/dl)  | 1.78  | Less than 0.05  |\n| ·Ferritin (ng/dl)  | 60930  | 7-140  |\n| ·LDH(IU/L)  | 2400  | 125-220  |\n| Liver studies  |  |  |\n| ·AST (U/L)  | 1451  | 8-33  |\n| ·ALT(U/L)  | 178.3  | 7-55  |\n| ·Albumin (g/dl)  | 2.8  | 3.4-5.4  |\n| Kidney function  |  |  |\n| ·CRE (mg/dl)  | 0.3  | 0.72-1.25  |\n| ·BUN(mg/dl)  | 23  | 5-18  |\n| ·UA(mg/dl)  | 5.4  | 3-7  |\n| Coagulation studies  |  |  |\n| ·PT (seconds)  | 14.4  | 11-13.5  |\n| ·PTT (seconds)  | 62.4  | 25-35  |\n| ·Fibrinogen (mg/dl)  | 130  | 200-400  |\n\nHemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare and potentially lethal condition characterized by a broad severe in-flammatory process that affects multiple organs， Which results from Immune system dysfunction， including unregulated acti-vation of macrophages natural killer cells (NK)， and cytotoxic Lymphocytes (CTLs). These abnormal regulatory changes con-stitute the hallmarks of the disease. HLH can be categorized into primary (Familial) and acquired (secondary) types. Pri-mary types are usually due to genetic mutations. In contrast， secondary types are caused by infections， drug-induced grafting， malignancy and macrophage activation syndrome. Viral infections are responsible (percentage) for the vast majority of SHLH cases， such as Epstein-Barr virus， cytomegalovirus， aden-ovirus， influenza virus， human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis A， B and C viruses.Recently， it has been identified that COVID-19 might be a possible causative trigger for SHLH|.\n\n【15】HLH has clinical and laboratory findings that are similar to MIS-C. According to the 2004 study on diagnostic criteria of HLH， diagnosis can be established by either molecular ev-idence associated with HLH or fulfilment of five or more of eight clinical and laboratory measures encompassing fever >38.5℃， splenomegaly， bicytopenia/pancytopenia (haemoglobin265 mg/dL， and/or hypofibrinogenemia > 150 mg/dL， Hyper-ferritinemia >500 ng/mL， Low or absent natural killer cell ac-tivity and elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptorHowever， the initial manifestations of HLH may not fulfil the full diagnostic criteria. In some cases， it has never been met.\n\n【16】MIS-C is often challenging to diagnose due to the overlap with other hyperinflammatory conditions such as SHLH. This is attributed to the lack of distinct clinical and laboratory features， making it difficult to distinguish between them. Although this overlapping is unclear， recent studies have shown that MIS-C and HLH share many clinical and laboratory findings. On the other hand， remarkable differences between both conditions have been reported. For instance， the inflammatory process is much more pronounced in SHLH compared to MIS-C. In addition， the inflammatory markers， particularly fibrinogen， ferritin， and liver enzymes， were higher in SHLH than in MIS-C. Pancytopenia was also found to be more severe in SHLH. In contrast， gastrointestinal manifestations，including abdominal pain， vomiting， and diarrhoea， were more prominent in MIS-C. Furthermore， cardiac dysfunction like myocarditis was seen more in patients with MIS-C than in our patients .\n\n【17】In this case report， we present a previously healthy 5-year-old male child， except for a history of an uneventful COVID-19infection 5 weeks ago， who presented with clinical manifesta-tions of MIS-C overlapping with hemophagocytic lymphohis-tiocytosis (HLH). The patient had a persistent fever for 9 days associated with abdominal pain. On physical assessment， the pa-tient had hypotonia， hepatosplenomegaly， ascites and petechial rash on lower limbs. Laboratory results showed pancytopenia， hyperferritinemia， hypertriglyceridemia， hypofibrinogenemia， hypoalbuminemia， elevated c-reactive protein (CRP)， aspartate aminotransferase (AST)， alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and procalcitonin and COVID-19 IgG positive. A whole body CT scan showed bilateral pleural effusion， diffuse lymphadenopa-thy， and Echocardiography revealed changes consistent with myocarditis and moderate ventricular dilation with trace pericar-dial effusion. The patient fulfilled five of eight HLH diagnostic criteria； for this reason， SHLH was suspected.\n\n【18】Therefore， genetic studies and bone marrow biopsy were per-\n\n【19】formed， which were normal. Although hemophagocytosis is one of the most important diagnostic criteria and is considered the pathognomic hallmark of the HLH on bone marrow biopsy， there is no evidence-dependent threshold for diagnosis. There-fore， its absence does not rule out HLH. Along with normal genetic and bone marrow findings， gastrointestinal and cardiac manifestations made diagnosing MIS-C much more likely.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is an overwhelming and delayed immune reaction to COVID-19 in-fection affecting almost all body organs. Therefore， clinicians should recognize this condition as early as possible. However， the diagnosis of MIS-C may be initially ambiguous and requires constant vigilance and greater effort due to the overlapping nature of its clinical and laboratory features with other hyperin-flammatory syndromes， particularly secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (SHLH). In this case study， we affirm the sig-nificance of suspecting MIS-C in patients younger than 21 years complaining of persistent fever and signs of end organ damage following COVID-19 infection， regardless of other features that may highly suggest the diagnosis of SHLH.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

After the resection of the urethral stricture segment and the end-to-end anastomosis were per-formed， in addition to stricture， urethrocutaneous fistula formation as another complication in the penoscrotal junction was confirmed. The direct vision internal urethrotomy did not improve all the above symptoms. The retrograde urethrogram and voiding cysto-urethrogram showed complete obliteration in the penile urethra， urethrocutaneous fistula， and proximal urethral bifurcation singularity. Intraoperatively， we found that the dis-tal urethral end had been anastomosed to the proximal false passage in the initial surgery and the proximal urethra was located in the dorsal side of the false passage. Then， tubularized preputial flap urethroplasty was performed. The patient was followed up for 10 months. His peak urinary flow was 18.3 milliliter per second. We would remind urologists that urethral end intraoperatively anastomosed to the false passage is a rare， se-rious， avoidable， and elementary medical error. Urethroplasty is one of the curative choices for treatment ofthis unexpected condition.\n\n【4】MeSH eywords： Urethra - surgery· Urethroplasty·False passage·Urethral Stricture - surgery ·\n\n【5】Urinary Fistula -surgery\n\n【6】Urethral stricture is one of the oldest known urological dis-eases. Urethral stricture mainly involves the anterior urethra. The etiology of anterior urethral strictures varies from iatro genic causes to infection and inflammatory， blunt pelvic trau-ma， lichen sclerosus， and unknown causes. In the past， anteri-or urethral strictures due to infective or inflammatory causes， such as secondary to gonococcal urethritis， predominated. With the development of antibiotics， there is now a changing pattern of etiology. Fenton et al. reported that idiopathic(34%) or iatrogenic (32%) causes accounted for the majority of symptomatic anterior urethral strictures， following by in-flammatory (20%) or traumatic (14%) causes. In developed countries， about 16.3% of iatrogenic urethral stricture comes from catheterization2\n\n【7】Treatment of urethral stricture includes intermittent urethral di-lation or self-catheterization， internal urethrotomy， urethral stent placement， and urethroplasty. Unfortunately， repeat urethral dila-tion and internal urethrotomy for the treatment of urethral stric-ture are neither clinically effective nor cost-effective . Moreover， repeated internal urethrotomy could worsen the stricture . There is no doubt that open reconstruction or urethroplasty is the optimal choice of management for urethral strictures，espe-cially for strictures greater than 1 centimeter in length\n\n【8】Here， we report a rare case of reconstruction for the distal ure-thral end incorrectly anastomosed to the proximal false pas-sage in the treatment of urethral stricture. This condition has not previously been reported in the literature. The patient’s in-formed consent was obtained prior to the writing of this article.\n\n【9】A 24-year-old man underwent an operation for traumatic frac-ture of the right lower limb under general anesthesia with cath-eter in another hospital approximately 3 years ago. The urinary catheter was removed on postoperative day 3. Two weeks later， he complained of dysuria. After confirmation of urethral stric ture， resection of the urethral stricture segment and end-to-end anastomosis were performed. Unfortunately， the urethrocutane-ous fistula formation in the anastomosis site，dysuria， and penile chordee were found after postoperative catheter removal. About1 year ago， direct vision interal urethrotomy was performed in the same hospital. However， the urethrocutaneous fistula in the penoscrotal junction and dysuria re-emerged after catheter re-moval . After repeated urethral dilatation， the symp-toms did not improve. He was admitted to our department after suprapubic cystotomy for urethral stricture and fistula formation.\n\n【10】Relevant hematological and biochemical investigations includ-ing urine cultures were normal， but routine urinalysis showed that the red-cell and white-cell counts were 6 and 87 per high-power field， respectively. The retrograde urethrogram and void-ing cysto-urethrogram showed complete obliteration in the pe-nile urethra， urethrocutaneous fistula， and proximal urethral bifurcation singularity .\n\n【11】Preoperative preparation included oral moxifloxacin at 400 mg daily and external genital area cleaning 4-6 times a day with1：1000 benzalkonium chloride for 3 days. Intraoperatively， we found that the distal urethral end was anastomosed to the proximal false passage in an initial surgery and the proximal urethra was located in the dorsal side of the false passage.\n\n【12】The urethral defect was found to be 4 centimeters after dis-section of both ends of the urethra and resection of stricture segments in penile straight condition .\n\n【13】Similar to Duckett's procedure for hypospadias ， transverse pedunculated preputial flap was harvested and tubularized to produce a urethral lumen approximately 4 cm in length and26-Fr in diameter. An 18-Fr 100% silicone catheter is used as a stent. Subsequently， the tubularized preputial flap was anasto-mosed tension-free to distal and proximal urethras followed by second-layer coverage using subcutaneous tissue . The surgical wound was dressed on the seventh post-opera-tive day and the catheter was removed on the twenty-first day.\n\n【14】The patient was followed up for 10 months. He had been free of the catheter， with 18.3 milliliter per second peak urinary flow. There were no the other postoperative complications such as infection， recurrence of urethral stricture and fistu-la， cutaneous necrosis， incontinence， or erectile dysfunction.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Urethral dilation， as the oldest and simplest treatment of urethral stricture， may be only curative for the patient with an epithelial stricture without spongiofibrosis. Internal ure-throtomy can be effective for the patient with very shorturethral strictures that do not involve the membranous ure-thra. Recurrence is the most common complication of inter-nal urethrotomy. The recurrence rate of stricture was report-ed as 19.4% in a series of patients treated by urethrotomy .\n\n【17】In this case， the urethral stricture was obviously iatrogenic， caused by urethral catheter use. Although the patient under-went resection of the stricture segment and end-to-end anas tomosis followed by direct vision internal urethrotomy and dilatation， his obstructive voiding symptoms and subsequent urethrocutaneous fistula did not improve. Until the exploratory operation， the proximal urethral bifurcation singularity in the retrograde urethrogram and voiding cysto-urethrogram was thought to be a false passage. A urethral end intraoperatively anastomosed to the false passage is a rare and serious medi-cal mistake. Until re-operation， the formation of urethrocuta-neous fistula and unimproved voiding symptoms after direct vision internal urethrotomy in this case is understandable.\n\n【18】Repeated internal urethrotomy will not only delay cure， but may also worsen stricture characteristics by increasing the length of the stricture and causing more spongiofibrosis . The most dependable technique of anterior urethral reconstruction is the complete excision of the area of fibrosis， with a prima-ry reanastomosis of the normal ends of the anterior urethra. Therefore， in this case， tubularized preputial flap urethroplasty is one of the curative choices for treatment of this unexpectedcondition. Unfortunately， due to delays in referral to a special-ist who performs urethroplasty and because of a shortage of excellent centers in urethral reconstruction， internal urethrot-omy has been over-used and urethroplasty under-used .\n\n【19】Conclusions\n\n【20】Acquired urethral stricture or fistula is quite unexpected and may result in much inconvenience， discomfort， physicaldisability， and psychological distress for the affected indi-vidual. We would remind urologists that urethral end intra-operatively anastomosed to the false passage is a rare， seri-ous， avoidable， and elementary medical error.

The mode of mechanical ventila-tion when there is mechanical separation of the two lungs and one lung is allowed to ventilate and the other lung is al-lowed to passively deflate is characteristic of one lung venti-lation (OLV). OLV strategies are commonly used for thoracic and cardiac surgeries， where differential ventilation is achieved by the use of bronchial blockers or double lumen tubes. This differential ventilation causes a greater degree of ventilation perfusion (V/Q) mismatch. Mechanical ventilation strategies for OLV differ from conventional modalities to the ability to adapt to this increased degree of V/Q mismatch .\n\n【8】We present a case of cancer causing complete unilateral endo-bronchial obstruction with refractory hypoxia on convention-al ventilation modalities， which improved with OLV strategy. To our knowledge， this is the first known case of utilizing this strategy in patients with complete endobronchial obstruction to improve oxygenation.\n\n【9】Case Report\n\n【10】We present a case of a 67-year-old male patient with a hun-dred pack-year smoking history， who presented to the emer-gency department for worsening shortness of breath. He had been recently diagnosed with a lung mass and was scheduled for an endobronchial ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration(EBUS) of his mediastinal lymphadenopathy. However， due to acutely worsening hypoxia and hypercapnia， he was admit-ted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The working diagnosis included respiratory failure secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation and endobronchial narrowing and atelectasis due to the lung mass. A chest com-puterized tomography (CT) scan was notable for a large right upper lobe mass， lymphadenopathy， and endobronchial nar-rowing of bilateral main stem bronchi. The patient was start-ed on treatment for COPD exacerbation . He contin-ued to deteriorate and required intubation and mechanical ventilation on day 2 of admission for worsening hypoxic re-spiratory failure. Post-intubation chest x-ray (CXR) was signif-icant for extensive opacification on the left side likely second-ary to complete lung collapse . Despite utilization of incrementally increased mechanical ventilator settings of as-sist control/pressure control ventilation with positive end ex-piratory pressure (PEEP) of 14 cm H，O， driving pressure (Pi) of 15 cm H，0， and fraction of inspired air (Fi02) of 1.00， the patient continued to deteriorate with worsening hypoxia. He was spontaneously breathing over the set rate on the venti-lator and generating tidal volumes of approximately 450 mL(6 mL/kg body weight). Arterial blood gas (ABG) showed pH\nof 7.37， PaCO2 of 33.9 mmol/L and Pa02 of 40 mmol/L at ox-ygen saturation of 86%. Repeat CXR was significant for wors-ening left-sided opacification and ipsilateral mediastinal shift consistent with left lung collapse possibly secondary to a mu-cous plug causing obstruction versus complete obstruction by an endobronchial mass. The patient was started on scheduled bronchodilator treatments with frequent chest physiotherapy to mobilize secretions and improve atelectasis of the left lung. The patient did not respond to these treatment modalities and the decision was made to perform a bedside flexible bronchos-copy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Bronchoscopy revealed partial obstruction of right main stem bronchus and complete obstruction of the left main stem bronchus by fungating mass-es. There was no presence of mucous plugs noted during theprocedure. The washings from the masses were sent for path ological evaluation and were consistent with a squamous cell lung cancer. No biopsies were taken as the mass was friable and bleeding and the patient could not tolerate a longer pro-cedure without worsening desaturation.\n\n【11】As the refractory hypoxic respiratory failure continued to wors-en， OLV strategy was implemented. The ventilation mode was changed to assist control/volume control with a rate of 16，inspi-ratory time of one second， Fi02 of 0.7， tidal volume of 350 mL(<6 mL/kg body weight) and PEEP of 5 cm H20. The patient re-sponded rapidly within hours with dramatically improved ox-ygenation with ABG of pH of 7.37， PaCO2 of 50 mmol/L and PaO2 146 mmol/L with pulse oximetry of more than 92%. The CXR remained unchanged . The patient was then sta ble to be transferred for endobronchial stenting of the right main bronchus at a tertiary referral center with intervention-al pulmonary capabilities.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Ventilation and perfusion are well matched anatomically dur-ing normal spontaneous ventilation. There is greater blood flow to the dependent parts of the lung with greater perfusion in these areas in the setting of normal respiratory system com-pliance. In a patient with functionally one aerated lung， there is a greater degree of V/Q mismatch due to a 20% to 30% in-creased right to left shunt causing worsening hypoxemia .\n\n【14】To minimize this V/Q mismatch， some strategies have been adapted from studies on acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) patients.\n\n【15】A review of lung ventilation strategies that was done by Lohser and Slinger demonstrated that during OLV， the ventilated lung can be exposed to large nonphysiological tidal volumes in addi-tion to the loss of normal functional capacity of the lung， thus making it more susceptible to ventilator induced lung injury. The ventilated lung is also exposed to oxidative stress and cap-illary sheer stress secondary to hyperperfusion. Re-expansion can also cause ischemia-reperfusion injury . Strategies such as very low tidal volume ventilation (4-6 mL/kg) and low PEEP(between 5-10 cm of H20) help to decrease barotrauma or volutrauma to the lung and improve hypoxia . In a study by Mascotto et al.， application of PEEP caused redistribution of blood to both the ventilated and non-ventilated lung and caused worsening of the shunt fraction . Application of ex-cessive PEEP can worsen this further and cause lung over dis-tension . Other strategies include lateral positioning to in-crease the effect of gravity to improve perfusion to the open ventilated lung， limiting plateau inspiratory pressures to less than 30 cm of H20 and Fi02 to maintain oxygen saturation greater than 90%， and recruitment maneuvers to help decrease the amount of V/Q mismatch observed . These strategies are especially important for ventilation of the left lung com-pared to the right lung， as the left lung is smaller in size \n\n【16】Our findings suggest that complete lung collapse secondary to complete endobronchial obstruction due to a lung mass is physiologically similar to lung collapse with an endobronchi-al block placement. In such patients， application of OLV strat-egies help to improve hypoxia by decreasing the right to left shunt and V/Q mismatch.\n\n【17】Conclusions\n\n【18】We propose that ventilating a patient with a complete uni-lateral endobronchial obstruction is physiologically similar to ventilating a patient with OLV. In such cases， for patients pre-senting with refractory hypoxia and complete unilateral en-dobronchial obstruction， application of this strategy should be considered to mitigate the increased degree of V/Q mis-match and prevent ventilator induced lung injury to the aerat-ed lung parenchyma. We believe that the observations in this case pave the way for further studies in this group of patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Owing to its rarity and similarity of symptoms with other chronic bowel diseases， intestinal hem-angioma is a differential diagnosis to be considered in patients presenting with symptoms such as abdominal pain and anemia.\n\n【2】Case Report： A 46-year-old woman with a history of diffuse abdominal pain and abdominal distension for 20 years present-ed with a worsening of symptoms in the past year. She denied weight loss or changes in bowel habits or stool appearance. Laboratory investigations showed microcytic hypochromic anemia. Colonoscopy results were nor-mal. A contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography scan showed focal and concentric thickening of the small intestine， measuring 8.3 cm， and associated with calcifications， intestinal dilation， mesenteric lymph node enlargement， and vascular dilatation and consistent with infectious granulomatous diseases such as in-testinal tuberculosis， carcinoid tumor， Crohn’s disease， and lymphoma. The tuberculin skin test resulted in a strong 25-mm reaction. We suspected intestinal tuberculosis or expansive injury， and the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy with visualization of a 4-to 5-cm bluish/blackish vegetating lesion located 220 cm from the Treitz angle. The anatomopathological study showed cavernous hemangioma of the small intestine， measuring 2.6x1.0 cm. The patient recovered well and remained asymptomatic.\n\n【3】Conclusions： Although rare， intestinal hemangioma should be on the list of differential diagnoses for chronic intestinal dis-eases， especially if there is anemia due to coexisting iron deficiency.\n\n【4】Keywords： Crohn Disease·Diagnosis， Differential · Hemangioma， Cavernous ·Inflammatory Bowel DiseasesHemangiomas are benign vascular neoplasms that originate from fast-growing embryonic mesodermal tissue and are char-acterized by a proliferation of endothelial cells， which manifest themselves in different forms， locations， and dimensions . Based on their histological appearance， hemangiomas are classi-fied into 3 categories： capillary， cavernous， and mixed. The cav-ernous hemangioma is the most common type. Hemangiomas are responsible for only 0.05% of all cases of gastrointestinal neoplasms .\n\n【5】Small intestine hemangioma is a rare disease， responsible for7% to 10% of all benign tumors in this location . It may have no clinical manifestations or it may cause symptoms such as low digestive bleeding， abdominal pain， and chronic symptoms of anemia. Less commonly， hemangiomas can cause complica-tions such as intussusception， obstruction， or intestinal perfo-ration . A study published in 2009 showed a prevalence of7.7% of intestinal hemangioma in 1044 patients with gastro-intestinal bleeding. The lesions were located in the jejunum in 7 patients， ileum in 5 patients， and both jejunum and ile-um in 1 patient .\n\n【6】Because the symptoms of intestinal hemangioma are similar to those of other chronic bowel diseases， such as inflamma-tory bowel disease or tuberculosis， it is a differential diagno-sis to be considered in these situations. Moreover， intestinal hemangioma should be considered in all patients under inves-tigation for anemia or gastrointestinal bleeding. Therefore， this article reports a case of a patient presenting with abdominal pain and anemia who was diagnosed with intestinal heman-gioma and discusses the differential diagnosis.\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】A 46-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency depart-ment with diffuse abdominal pain and abdominal distension. She had these symptoms in a milder intensity since she was26 years old， but they had worsened in the last year. She de-nied weight loss or changes in bowel habits or stool appear-ance. The physical examination findings were unremarkable. Laboratory investigation showed microcytic hypochromic ane-mia， without other variations. The patient's colonoscopy re-sults were normal. A contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed focal and concentric thickening of small intestine measuring 8.3 cm， associated with calcifica-tions， intestinal dilation， mesenteric lymph node enlargement， and vascular dilatation ， consistent with infectious granulomatous diseases such as intestinal tuberculosis， car-cinoid tumor， Crohn's disease， or lymphoma. The tuberculin skin test resulted in a strong 25-mm reaction. Because of asuspected intestinal tuberculosis or expansive injury， the pa-tient underwent an exploratory laparotomy with visualization and resection of a 4-to 5-cm bluish/blackish vegetating le-sion located 220 cm from the Treitz angle .The anatomopathological study showed a cavernous hemangioma of the small intestine measuring 2.6×1.0 cm  and characterized by the pro-liferation of vessels in the mucous chorion， forming large cav-ernous vascular channels with blood-filled sinus spaces. The endothelium was lined by a single layer of flattened cells； it lacked atypia or mitotic activity and was surrounded by a ro-bust eosinophilic adventitial layer with smooth muscle， fibro-blasts， and a moderate degree of fibrosis. The patient recov-ered well and remained asymptomatic after surgery.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain and disten-sion can be presented in a wide variety of differential diagno-ses and most often require complementary tests to make the correct diagnosis. In this report， the initial hypothes is was in-flammatory bowel disease， more specifically Crohn's disease， owing to the symptoms of abdominal pain with previous ep-isodes of intestinal obstruction. Intestinal tuberculosis is an important differential diagnosis in Brazil because of the high prevalence of this infectious chronic disease in the country.\n\n【11】Crohn's disease is a chronic entity with a multifactorial etiol-ogy， which can progress to persistent intestinal damage and functional disability， causing impairments in a patient's qual-ity of life . Common symptoms include abdominal pain，diarrhea， fever， and weight loss， most of which were not pres-ent in our present case. More than one-third of patients have disease complications， such as stenoses， fistulas， or absceSs-es at the time of diagnosis， and about 50% will undergo sur-gery for the condition at some time in their lives . The dis ease should be investigated in all individuals who have these symptoms or in the presence of any typical alteration in com-plementary exams， as in the present case. The endoscopic approach includes performing an ileocolonoscopy， with biop-sies from all the segments， including the terminal ileum . Radiologic exams such as magnetic resonance imaging， com-puterized enterotomography and trans-abdominal ultraso-nography are complementary to endoscopy study and offer the opportunity to investigate the presence of complications， such as stenoses and fistulas . In inconclusive cases with the presence of complications， as in the present case，surgery may be indicated.\n\n【12】Intestinal tuberculosis is an important differential diagnosis to be considered in immunocompromised individuals， in pa-tients who migrate to affected areas， and in residents of en-demic areas ， such as our patient. The predominant symp-toms are abdominal pain， weight loss， bloating， fever， anorexia， vomiting， and diarrhea . Endoscopic characteristics include typical lesions such as colonic ulcers， involvement of the ileo-cecal valve， and pseudopolyps . As a differential diagno-sis， the presence of longitudinal or aphthous ulcers， a paral-lelepiped pattern， and perianal lesions are most prevalent in Crohn's disease . In the case of a diagnosis of tuberculosis， the tuberculin skin test is part of the arsenal of complemen-tary tests， but it has limited value in populations vaccinated with BCG， as in Brazil， because of a high rate of false-positive results . In our patient， despite the positivity of the tuber-culin skin test， the histological analysis did not show findings suggestive of intestinal tuberculosis.\n\n【13】Another differential diagnosis is expansive lesions， such as ade-nocarcinoma and gastrointestinal lymphomas. Adenocarcinoma is located predominantly in the second duodenal portion， and the main symptoms are bleeding， intestinal obstruction， ob-structive jaundice， vomiting， and consuming syndrome . Primary gastrointestinal lymphoma is a rare malignancy and comprises lymphomas that originate from the gastrointestinal tract. In a systematic review ， the authors reported that the main symptom of gastrointestinal lymphoma is abdominal pain (59.3%). The initial location of the lymphoma is in the il-eocecum (37.2%)， and 53.6% area diffuse large B-cell lympho-ma subtype. The combination of surgery and chemotherapy is the most prescribed treatment (60.7%). The factors associ-ated with higher survival were the presence of B-cell lympho-ma and ileocecum location， while advanced stage and B symp-toms were associated with poorer survival .\n\n【14】Of all gastrointestinal neoplasms， hemangioma is responsible for approximately 0.05% of the cases . The clinical manifes-tation is mainly represented by gastrointestinal bleeding， hid-den or not， and anemia due to iron deficiency. Presently， with the advent of the endoscopic capsule and balloon-assisted enteroscopy， the diagnosis of hemangioma has become less dependent on surgical methods， since most intestinal vascu-lar abnormalities are rarely visible on CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging . Hu et al  studied 37 patients di-agnosed with intestinal hemangioma from 2000 to 2018. The most common topography was in the jejunum (60.9%). It is im-portant to mention that， in contrast to our case， most of their diagnoses were performed by endoscopic methods (91.9%) . Regarding the treatment， the authors observed that 17 cas-es (45.9%) were treated endoscopically according to guide-lines of bowel bleeding treatment ， and surgical procedure should be considered as the last option . As we did not have a conclusive diagnosis， laparoscopy was chosen to con-duct a better evaluation. According to the anatomopatholog-ical results， a diagnosis of intestinal cavernous hemangioma was confirmed.\n\n【15】Other differential diagnoses should be considered in patients with abdominal pain， such as ischemic colitis， systemic vas-culitis， and drug-induced colitis， in addition to infectious con-ditions caused by Yersinia enterocolitis， histoplasmosis， ame-biasis， helminthiasis， Clostridium difficile， or cytomegalovirus infection .\n\n【16】Conclusions\n\n【17】Clinical，endoscopic，and radiological manifestations of heman-gioma and other gastrointestinal diseases overlap， a fact that can delay accurate diagnosis owing to the wide range of pos-sible etiologies. Intestinal hemangioma， although rare，should be on the list of differential diagnoses for intestinal diseases. The medical team must be alert and consider this entity，espe-cially in patients with anemia or intestinal bleeding.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

This is the first published case report on the efficacy of maintenance treatment with liposomal cytarabine of cen-tral nervous system involvement in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in our department.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】We report the case of a 54-year-old male Caucasian Polish patient with a long (>10 years) histo-ry of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who manifested cerebral symptoms. Magnetic resonance im-aging revealed neoplastic meningitis. A flow cytometry analysis of cerebrospinal fluid confirmed the presence of clonal B lymphocytes. At first， the treatment was based on drugs such as metho-trexate， cytarabine and dexamethasone， which were intrathecally administered. When complete remission had been reached， depot liposomal cytarabine (DepoCyte) administration was started. The patient received liposomal cytarabine every 3-4 weeks 7 times in total as a maintenance treat-ment and this therapy was well tolerated. Central nervous system treatment was performed paral-lel with systematic therapy (fludarabine and cyclephesphamide). Complete remission with mini-mal residual disease negativity in bone marrow was obtained. Complete remission in the central nervous system was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid is still kept16 months after central nervous system remission.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】This is the first therapeutic use of liposomal cytarabine as maintenance treatment in our clinic. Its use in conjunction with systematic chemotherapy appears to be effective and safe since complete remission has been achieved for 16 months since maintenance therapy began.\n\n【6】key words：\n\n【7】chronic lymphocyticleukaemia· neoplastic meningitis ·immunophenotyping· intrathecal chemotherapy\n\n【8】BACKGROUND\n\n【9】Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common leukaemia among adults in Western countries， with an annu-al incidence of 3：100000.Usually， CLL patients do not manifest any symptoms. With disease progression lymphade-nopathy， spleno- and hepatomegaly can eccur， but cerebral manifestation is rare . This extra-nodular presentation， involving CNS infiltration in most cases， appears in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and aggressive lymphoma such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma . Symptoms of CNS in-volvement may include non-specific headaches， changes in mental status， cranial nerve abnormality， and weakness of the extremities . In making the diagnosis， flow cytome-try (using FACS analysis) of cerebrospinal fluid was used， which is the recommended method in CNS involvement in the course of haematological diseases .\n\n【10】This case report describes a patient who developed cerebral symptoms 10 years after the diagnosis of CLL. It consisted of presentation in the CNS with in filtration of monoclonal B lymphocytes. Systematic and intrathecal chemotherapy was started， and it achieved a very good response.\n\n【11】CASE REPORT\n\n【12】Diagnosis\n\n【13】A 54-year-old male Caucasian Polish patient was diagnosed with CLL Rai stage I in 1999. The diagnosis was based on peripheral blood leucocytosis (30 g/l) with lymphocytosis(28 g/l). He progressed to stage II of the disease within 2years -splenomegaly was observed (134x64mm) using ab-dominal ultrasonogram (USG) examination and cervical lymphadenopathy was also present. There was no evidence of anaemia or thrombocytopenia. An immunophenotype of marrow cells， as determined by flow cytometry (FACS)， was characterized by the expression of CD5+， CD19+， CD20+， and CD23+ .\n\n【14】Monotherapy treatment\n\n【15】Monotherapy with fludarabine 50 mg/d on days 1-5 was started every 4 weeks and continued for 6 cycles. There was no complication during this therapy. This treatment was stopped in March 2002， with good resultant response(without splenomegaly， abnormality in blood test-leuco-cytosis 4.5 g/1 with lymphocytosis 1.5 g/1). From 2002 to2004 the patient was under observation. From 2004 he wastreated in the Haematological Outpatient Department with chlorambucil administered periodically at a daily dose of10 mg for 7 days a month， due to a second progression to Rai stage II (spleen dimension after abdominal USG ex-amination was 147x53mm). Good resultant response was achieved (leukocytosis 15 g/l with lymphocytosis 11 g/l with-out any other abnormalities both in physical and in blood examinations). In August 2009， 10 years after the diagno-sis of CLL， headache with bilateral ptosis and eye sight dis-orders occurred. A comprehensive review of systems also revealed decreased appetite with a 4 kg weight loss over 6months， and an intermittent dry cough. Upon physical ex-amination there was no evidence of diffuse lymphadenop-athy. Cardiovascular and pulmonary examinations were normal， but abdominal examination revealed splenomeg-aly (168x74mm). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed meningeal enhancement without focal change in the brain. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis (157 cells/mm)， and flow cytom-etry confirmed the diagnosis with the presence of mang-clonal B lymphocytes CD5+19+ (80%)， CD20+ (80%)，and CD19+ (81%) . Small mature lymphocytes were also observed in more than 80% of cells in the cytological examination of bone marrow.Other laboratory examina-tions showed some abnormalities in peripheral blood-hy-perleucocytosis (16 g/1) with 77% lymphocytosis and high CD38 expression， platelet count 100 g/l， and elevated levels of plasma lactate dehydrogenase activity (201 IU/L). The peripheral blood cytogenetic FISH analysis revealed triso-my 12 and deletion of 13q.\n\n【16】Combination treatment\n\n【17】Combined chemotherapy was started in February 2010.A daily dose of 45 mg fludarabine and 250 mg cyclophospha-mide (FC) were intravenously administered on days 1-3 ev-ery 6 weeks. This systematic treatment was associated with intrathecal administration of cytostatics-15mg methotrex-ate + 40 mg cytosine arabinoside +12.5 mg prednisolone. This treatment was performed every week until the CNSle-sion completely regressed， which was defined as 2 negative results of cerebrospinal fluid after cytomorphological ex-amination as confirmed by flow cytometry (FACS analysis). Treatment outcome was achieved within 5 weeks. A grad-ual improvement of neurological symptoms was observed over the next weeks. From March 2010， liposomal cytara-bine was admin istered intrathecally as a maintenance treat-ment. Therapy with liposomal cytarabine was also correlat-ed with systematic chemotherapy. Every 4 weeks the patientreceived intrathecal liposomal cytarabine via lumbar punc-ture with premedication ofdexamethasone (4 mg/d intrave-nously before lumbar puncture and every 4 days thereafter).\n\n【18】Table 1.

Complete remission in the CNS was still evident 16 months after maintenance treatment with liposomal cytarabine was started. There were no abnor-malities in control MRI of the brain and in flow cytometry examination of the cerebrospinal fluid； furthermore， sys-tematic haematological remission MRD negative had been achieved and persisted.\n\n【26】DISCUSSION\n\n【27】CNS relapse remains an important cause of mortality in lym-phoma patients . Some subtypes of high-grade lympho-ma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia are associated with relatively high rates of CNS relapse， estimated at 30-50%in adults and 30-50% in children treated for ALL without CNS prophylaxis. Recently， CNS-directed systemic chemo-therapy and intrathecal prophylaxis are recommended and<5% CNS relapses are observed . CNS involvement fromlymphoma is the sole manifestation of relapse in approxi-mately 50% of patients and occurs with progressive systemic disease in the other 50%. In our patient CNS relapse was diagnosed as a meningeal disease and appeared with the systemic third relapse of CLL. Several methods for de-tecting CNS lymphoma are used， but the standard method is a microscopic examination of cerebrospinal fluid cells. Flow cytometry， a more advanced method to detect leuke-mia-associated cell surface antigens ， is recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network for the di-agnosis CNS lymphoma . This method still lacks stan-dardization and we performed flow-cytometry examination of blood and bone marrow lymphocytes simultaneously for the comparison of cerebrospinal fluid neoplastic cells eval-uation . More recent advances have focused on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a diagnostic technique in the diagnosis of CNS involvement from lymphoma ， but as this method is more expensive and time-consuming due to the technique procedures， it has not been put into our daily clinical practice.\n\n【28】Although no ultimate therapy has clearly emerged from clinical trials for lymphoma patients with central nerveus involvement， intrathecal chemotherapy is the most com-monly proposed therapy . We decided to treat the patient with systematic chemotherapy combined with intra-thecally administered methotrexate， cytarabine and dexa-methasone. When complete remission had been reached， depot liposomal cytarabine (DepoCyte) administration as a maintenance treatment was performed. A randomized， controlled phase II study of patients with lymphomatous meningitis applied 50 mg of Depo-Cyte for 4 doses every 4weeks as a maintenance phase， but 2 doses of DepoCyte inthe induction phase and 4 doses in consolidation were also used . Time to neurologic progression and survival were estimated as 78.5 and 99.5 days respectively， but in the above trial patients with cytologically documented lymphomatous meningitis were included. There was no information about CLL patients. In the remaining paper， <15% l-year surviv-al for neoplastic meningitis was published . Recently， Spanish authors reported good response to depot liposomal cytarabine treatment for leptomeningeal disease in 7 CLL or Richter’s syndrome cases， but long-lasting maintenance intrathecal therapy has not been established as yet .\n\n【29】In this paper we report on a patient who survived for many years， and who achieved a fourth complete remission after systematic therapy combined with 7 doses of maintenance treatment using intrathecal DepoCyte.\n\n【30】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【31】Cerebral manifestation of CLL is very rare. In our experi-ence there are only a few patients with CNS abnormalities already diagnosed with CLL. The flow cytometry of the ce-rebrospinal fluid is an easy and feasible method to confirm infiltration in the CNS. This is the first therapeutic use of li-posomal cytarabine as maintenance treatment in our clinic. This intrathecal therapy is not only effective in meningeal involvement in CLL， but it is also safe. The CNS treatment should be performed in parallel with intravenous chemo-therapy when systematic progression is present. Such asso-ciation with systemic chemotherapy is suitable and also well-tolerated. After a 16-month period of observation， there were no complications with implementation of this treat-ment and the patient is still in complete remission in the CNS as confirmed by FACS and MRI examination.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Anti-insulin antibodies were negative and antidiabetic drugs untraceable. The glucagon-stimulation test was positive. Growth hormone， adrenocorticotropin hormone， and phosphorus and calcium metabolism were normal. Dual-phase computed tomography detected a lesion compatible with an insulinoma.

The initial diagnosis is based on Whipple's triad： symptoms compatible with hypoglycemia， low blood glucose levels measured at the time of symptoms， and improvement in symptoms after carbohydrates adminis-tration ； the diagnosis is confirmed by the demonstration of inadequately high serum insulin levels during hypoglycemia .\n\n【8】Insulinomas are usually benign， isolated lesions， but malignant insulinomas have been reported in children . About 10% of insulinomas are associated with mu ltiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1) . MEN-1 is an autosomal dominant syn-drome in which tumors develop in the parathyroid， anterior pituitary， and pancreas. In more than 85% of patients， para-thyroid tumors are the first manifestation， resulting in prima-ry hyperparathyroidism .\n\n【9】Case Report\n\n【10】An 11-year-old white boy was admitted to our pediatric emer-gency room for an episode of fainting lasting a few seconds. Blood tests revealed hypoglycemia (42 mg/dL)； intravenous infusion 10% glucose normalized his blood sugar levels and his symptoms resolved.\n\n【11】His family explained that over the previous 3 months， coincid ing with his parents’recent separation， he had had self-limit-ing episodes of dizziness， sometimes needing to lie down for a few seconds， almost always in the morning before going to school. During the last few weeks， he also showed a change of character， with moments of agitation alternating with drows-iness. His parents thought that the symptoms were psycho-logical and related to his family situation， and the boy had an upcoming appointment at a mental health center.\n\n【12】Blood glucose returned to normal after intravenous glucose infusion. The boy was discharged home on a Saturday eve-ning and was scheduled for a follow-up visit at our pediatric Endocrinology Department 2 days later. He was given a glu-cometer to check his blood sugar if symptoms reappeared.\n\n【13】He returned to the Emergency Department 48 h after dis-charge， before his scheduled appointment， for a self-limited episode of diplopia with capillary glycemia 45 mg/dL measured at home. On arrival at the hospital， the boy was asymptomatic，but capillary glycemia was 44 mg/dL without ketonemia. His hy-poglycemia was treated， and he was admitted for observation.\n\n【14】A fasting glucose test found hypoglycemia (21 mg/dL) within2 h in the presence of inappropriately elevated insulin concen-trations (10.6 pU/mL) and C-peptide levels (1.77 ng/mL). Tests for anti-insulin antibodies and oral antidiabetic drugs were negative. B-hydroxybutyrate was undetectable in the blood. Cortisol， ACTH， GH， and phosphorus and calcium metabolism were normal； together with the absence of a family history， these findings made the diagnosis of MEN1 highly unlikely. The glucagon test was positive： glycemia increased from45 mg/dL to 104 mg/dL， pointing to endogenous hyperinsulinism.\n\n【15】Findings of an abdominal ultrasound were normal. Dual-phase computed tomography (CT) within 24 h of admission showed an isolated enhancing lesion measuring 11 mm in diameter in the junction of the body and tail of the pancreas， compati-ble with insulinoma .\n\n【16】Endoscopic ultrasound showed a homogeneous isoechoic lesion measuring 11 mm x 13 mm in the junction of the body and tai! of the pancreas that lacked the\"salt-and-pepper\" pattern characteristic of normal pancreatic tissue. Histologic exami-nation of the fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy specimen found large cytoplasmic cells with large， eccentric nuclei con-taining granular chromatin， findings compatible with neuro-endocrine neoplasia. Immunohistochemistry was positive for synaptophysin and chromogranin， and the estimated prolifer-ation index was 5% .\n\n【17】The Surgical Committee opted for laparoscopic partial pancreatectomy.\n\n【18】Preoperatively， our patient had a severe tendency to hypo-glycemia； his blood glucose levels dropped below 50 mg/dL after ingesting fast-absorbing carbohydrates or during fast-ing longer than 3 hours. Blood glucose levels normalized with adherence to a diet consisting of frequent meals with small portions and avoiding fast-absorbing carbohydrates. The tu-mor location precluded enucleation， so the tumor was resect-ed with part of the body and tail of the pancreas under in-traoperative ultrasound guidance. No complications occurred during the procedure.\n\n【19】A histologic study showed a well-differentiated pancreatic neu-roendocrine tumor measuring 15x13 mm  made up of large trabeculae and solid nests of cells larger than the islet cells in the rest of the pancreas； the tumor cells had round central nuclei with thick chromatin and prominent nucleoli.\n\n【20】No necrosis or mitotic figures were seen. Immunohistochemistry showed diffuse and intense expression of synaptophysin and heterogeneous expression of chromogranin .\n\n【21】After surgery， blood glucose levels remained within the nor-mal range， allowing the patient to have a normal diet. He pre-sented no further symptoms of hypoglycemia， and subsequent follow-ups were normal. He has not developed carbohydrate intolerance to date.\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】This case illustrates how insulinomas may be initially mistaken for a psychological or neurological disorder . Unspecific symptoms such as dizziness， drowsiness， or behavioral changes in children - especially in the mornings， after fasting through the night - might be due to hypoglycemia ， and it is important to check Whipple’s triad to rule out an insulinoma.\n\n【24】In the differential diagnosis of hypoglycemia in children， it is fundamental to determine whether ketonemia is present. Ketonemia is present in hypoglycemias caused by a wide range of conditions， such as substrate deficiency， deficiency of coun-terregulatory hormones， abnormal liver glycogen metabolism， or ketotic hypoglycemia . Ketonemia is not present in fatty-acid metabolism disorders (in which blood levels of fatty acids are elevated) or in hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. In hyperin-sulinism， C-peptide levels in line with elevated insulin levels， together with negative screening for antidiabetic drugs， help rule out exogenous causes and direct the diagnosis toward an insulinoma or congenital hyperinsulinism . Given that congenital hyperinsulinism usually manifests in the neonatalperiod ， we reasoned that the endogenous hyperinsulinism in this 11-year-old boy was most likely due to an insulinoma.\n\n【25】Abdominal CT located the lesion， endoscopic ultrasound con-firmed its presence and enabled its biopsy， and histologic anal-ysis confirmed that it was a neuroendocrine tumor.\n\n【26】Although some authors recommend MRI as the first-line imaging test because it does not use ionizing radiation and has a higher sensitivity than CT ， the sensitivity of dual-phase CT is also high (85-100%) . In some reported cas-es， abdominal ultrasonography identified an insulinoma ， but not in our case. The sensitivity of 18F-DOPA PET/CT is in-consistent . When other techniques fail to demonstrate an insulinoma in cases with strong suspicion， intra-arterial cal-cium stimulation yields good results . Intraoperative ultra-sound has multiple advantages that optimize treatment .\n\n【27】Endoscopic ultrasound combined with FNA is a new strat-egy for diagnosing pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. This technique is believed to have better sensitivity than CT or MRI ， although some authors disagree . It is im-portant to remember that endoscopic ultrasound is operator-dependent and that the technique is evolving . A small， homogenous lesion， as in our case， suggests a benign endo-crine tumor . Furthermore， endoscopic ultrasound can guide FNA biopsy， which can confirm the diagnosis of neuro-endocrine tumors， although additional studies are required to grade malignant lesions . Further investigations are need-ed to establish recommendations on the diagnostic approach to pediatric insulinoma.\n\n【28】The standard treatment of insulinoma is surgery， but en-doscopic-ultrasound-guided ethanol ablation of pancreat-ic neuroendocrine tumors has proven safe and efficacious in adult patients in whom surgery is contraindicated .\n\n【29】We considered ethanol ablation of the lesion in our patient， because endoscopic ultrasound was performed and our cen-ter is experienced in this technique； however， we found no re-ports of ethanol ablation in children and our patient had no contraindications for surgery. In this case， our team opted for the classic surgical treatment， although it is not risk free ； nevertheless， ethanol ablation is a promising management strategy that we will consider in the future.\n\n【30】A fractional diet avoiding fast-absorbing carbohydrates was sufficient for our patient to maintain normal glucose blood levels without having to resort to medications with known adverse effects  and that are not always efficacious .\n\n【31】Conclusions\n\n【32】In children with unspecific symptoms compatible with hypo-glycemia， blood glucose must be evaluated to confirm the ex-istence of low blood glucose levels. This simple procedure can allow the diagnosis of severe but treatable diseases. After hy-poglycemia is confirmed， another simple test， determining blood ketone levels， is very useful for differential diagnosis.\n\n【33】The diagnostic approach to pediatric insulinoma encompass-es a wide range of possibilities and represents a challenge for multidisciplinary teamwork.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Pulmonary complications include pleural effusions， hypoxia， atelectasis， and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Pleural effusion is an indicator of poor prognosis in pancreatitis. This case report supports the few existing reports about best practice for the diagnosis and treatment of a pancreatic duct leak causing refractory right pleural effusion.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】In this case report， a woman with long-term rheumatoid arthritis and recent severe gallstone pancreatitis re-quired hospital readmission for progressive shortness of breath from recurrent massive right pleural effusion from the pancreatitis with an ongoing pancreatic leak and a pseudocyst. She had diagnostic thoracentesis and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) that was followed by endoscopic retrograde cholan-giopancreatography (ERCP) and stent placement as a therapeutic procedure， with complete resolution of her symptoms.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】This case report demonstrates an atypical presentation of complications from severe pancreatitis. MRCP is the criterion standard and best initial test for diagnosing a fistula. When possible， ERCP is preferred for the initial evaluation and treatment of pancreatic leaks and fistulas. In the present case report， treatment with endo-scopic cystogastrostomies was effective for the internal drainage of the pseudocyst， pancreatic duct leak， and eventual resolution of the pleural effusion.\n\n【6】Keywords： Digestive System Fistula · Pancreatitis · Pericardial Effusion\n\n【7】Severe acute pancreatitis has been associated with a high in hospital mortality rate . Pancreatic ascites and pleural ef-fusion have been reported as complications of severe pan creatitis. In these cases， the pathophysiology is related to the disruption of the pancreatic duct， which causes fistula forma-tion in the abdomen or pleural space . A pancreatic fistula is a well-recognized complication of pancreatitis in acute or chronic pancreatitis； it is mostly due to gallstone formation or excessive alcohol consumption . The diagnosis of pan-creatitis-induced right-sided pleural effusion requires high clinical suspicion combined with laboratory findings and con-firmation by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography(MRCP) . The management of this condition is multidisci-plinary， involving a pulmonologist， gastroenterologist， radiolo-gist， and a thoracic surgeon . If patients with recent severe pancreatitis present with shortness of breath and refractory pleural effusion， clinicians should have high suspicion of a se-vere pancreatitis complication causing a pancreatic leak. After confirming elevated amylase levels from analysis of the tho-racentesis fluid， MRCP is recommended as an initial diagnos-tic work-up if available， or endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) is recommended as a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 52-year-old woman had severe deforming rheumatoid ar-thritis since she was in her 20s and was on long-term treat-ment with prednisone. Initially， she presented with epigastric abdominal pain and diarrhea for 4 days. The sharp pain was severe (10/10 in the epigastric region) and radiated to her back. She had an elevated lipase level of 311 IU/L. MRCP re-vealed gallstone pancreatitis with no common bile duct dila-tion， although there was extensive fat stranding of the pancre-as that extended into the root of the mesenteries with a small amount of free fluid. This episode of pain was considered to be severe pancreatitis. Due to the extensive fat stranding， it could represent early necrosis； there was evidence of peripan-creatic fluid collection near the head and tail of the pancreas. She met the criteria for severe pancreatitis using the Modified Glasgow Imrie Severity Criteria for Acute Pancreatitis (patient score 3， albumin <2 g/dL， calcium <8 mg/dL， and white blood cells>154000/uL). A gastroenterologic evaluation resulted in the recommendation for a surgical consultation. The cholecys-tectomy was postponed due to the severe pancreatitis and she had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2， indicating a high periop-erative mortality and complication rate. However， as she was asymptomatic with an unknown onset of the SARS-CoV-2 in-fection， she was not treated for it. The pancreatitis was man-aged with standard treatment and care. Subsequently， shedeveloped a large， symptomatic right pleural effusion. This was suspected to be related to an inflammatory response from the pancreatitis. Given the size of the effusion and the background of rheumatoid arthritis， a diagnostic and thera-peutic thoracentesis was performed.Ultrasound-guided tho-racentesis drained 1 L of clear amber fluid from the right pos-terior chest wall， which was analyzed using Light's criteria  and it was consistent with an exudative effusion. Pleural flu-id studies revealed a pH of 7.53， pleural fluid lactate dehy-drogenase (LDH) of 390 U/L with a corresponding serum LDH of 178 U/L， total protein was 4.2 g/dL， and total serum pro-tein was 6.2 g/dL. The pleural fluid showed 8074 cells/uL of red blood cells and 7030 cells/uL of white blood cells with80% neutrophils. The amylase content of this sample was not tested as this was considered a pleural effusion related to the pancreatitis. She continued to have significant leukocy-tosis and pain preventing oral nutrition and needed total par-enteral nutrition (TPN). A repeat computed tomography (CT) demonstrated worsened small bowel wall thickening； it was thickest at the center. There was suspicion of severe infec-tious vs inflammatory enteritis with associated ascites. There was significant omental fat stranding， and concern about in-fection and/or malignancy. Some non-enhancing fluid collec-tion near the pancreatic tail was noted. The outcome of the surgical consultation was a diagnostic laparoscopic evalua-tion with an omental biopsy (given the immunocompromised state) to exclude any atypical infection or malignancy. There were no significant abnormalities identified during the 4-quad-rant laparoscopic exploration. The peritoneal fluid was aspi-rated and a partial omentectomy was performed； both these samples were sent to the pathology laboratory. Pathologic in-spection identified benign fatty tissue with small focal patch-es of reactive mesothelial cells and chronic inflammatory and\n\n【10】Commu\n\n【11】Compressed JPEG 95\n\n【12】histiocytic cells with small fat-necrotic nodules. Her condition improved in response to the standard treatment for pancreati-tis； she was stable and discharged home after 33 days. Given the severity of the pancreatitis， it was anticipated that an in-terval cholecystectomy would be completed as an outpatient procedure in 1 to 2 weeks.\n\n【13】Approximately 1 month after discharge from the hospital， she presented with 1 week of significant progressively wors-ening dyspnea with tachypnea leading to lightheadedness， which had prompted her to return to the hospital. Although she had a longstanding history of rheumatoid arthritis， she denied any history of pleural or pulmonary complications. She had no history of asthma， pneumonia， or tuberculosis.\n\n【14】Her physical exam was remarkable for dullness to percussion over the right thorax and absent breath sounds on the right side. Her vital signs were within the normal limits. Significant pleural effusion on the right side was noted on a chest X-ray， and there were no increases in the inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein 9.4 mg/dL and erythrocyte sedi-mentation rate 72 mm/h) and no elevation of the white blood cell count. Her laboratory results were significant for hypokale-mia (potassium 2.8 mEq/L)， low albumin (1.9 gm/dL)， and ele-vated globulin (3.5 gm/dL). Her liver enzymes and lipase were normal. A CT scan with contrast  showed moderate right pleural effusion with persistent loculated fluid collection near the tail of the pancreas and cholelithiasis. An ultrasound-guided thoracentesis was performed and drained approximate-ly 1.3 L of serous fluid， which yielded negative results for Cy-tology and gram stains， and was exudative in nature， with an amylase level of>12 000 units.\n\n【15】On the second day of hospitalization， an MRCP was recom-mended  due to high suspicion of a pancreatic leak or fistula. The MRCP with secretin stimulation did not show a clear fistulous tract； however， the concern for a pleural pan-creatic fistula or pancreatic duct leak with ascites remained. A laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed without com-plications. The intraoperative evaluation demonstrated min-imal ascites fluid， which was sampled and showed a marked elevation in the fluid amylase.\n\n【16】ERCP was performed and showed a pancreatic leak at the pan-creatic tail  and a pancreatic duct stent was inserted. She tolerated all the procedures without any complications. The pleural fluids reaccumulated over the next 48 hours， this was confirmed by a chest X-ray， and the shortness of breath re-curred. Another CT confirmed the diagnosis of pleural effusionand the decision to perform endoscopic cystogastrostomies was made. The patient was referred to a tertiary center， where she underwent a repeat ERCP and stent replacement. She un-derwent endoscopic cystogastrostomies with internal pseudo-cyst drainage and tolerated it well. At the 2-week and 6-week follow-up appointments， she was symptom free. The patient gave informed consent for the publication of this case report.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】The inflammatory process in acute pancreatitis is a severe form of inflammation， which is often complicated by multi-organ dysfunction syndrome and has a mortality rate of 15%to 20%. Once this inflammatory process is initiated within the acinar cells， it leads to a generalized systemic inflammatory response syndrome . On the other hand， chronic pancreati-tis is an ongoing pathologic response to pancreatic injury that leads to permanent structural changes in the pancreas， result-ing in the impairment of exocrine and endocrine functions . Pancreatic duct disruption is a well-recognized complication of these processes， leading to the formation of a pseudocyst or a fistula. Pancreatic duct leaks occur as a result of acute and chronic pancreatitis or in the setting of pancreatic trau-ma. The manifestations of these leaks include pseudocysts， pancreatic ascites， high amylase pleural effusions， discon-nected duct syndrome， and internal and external pancreat-ic fistulas. Pancreatic leaks or fistulas are traditionally clas-sified into internal or external leaks or fistulas . External leaks represent pancreatico-cutaneous fistulas and are typi-cally iatrogenic in etiology. Internal leaks present in multiple forms， including pancreatic ascites， pleural effusions， and pseu-docysts . The prognosis and management of pancreatic leaks varies based on the clinical manifestations of the leak.\n\n【19】Leaks can occur in the setting of pancreatic trauma or as se-quela from surgical interventions. Pancreatic ascites and pleu-ral effusion are rare complications of chronic and acute pan-creatitis and have a mortality rate of 20% to 30%. These pleural effusions are characterized by high amylase levels up to 30 times greater than the corresponding serum levels， pro-tein >30 gm/L， and an LDH ratio of >0.6. Sixty-eight percent of the pleural effusions are left-sided， while 22% are bilateral and <10% are right-sided . The mechanism of pleural effu-sion is related to a trans-diaphragmatic lymphatic blockage， a pancreatic pleural fistula connecting the peritoneal and pleu-ral spaces together， or to diaphragmatic defects like blebs and fenestration defects .\n\n【20】The diagnosis of pancreatic pleural effusion depends on high clinical suspicion， detailed history-taking， massive pleural ef-fusion with high amylase levels， and a confirmatory imaging test ； this can be an ultrasound with low sensitivity or a CT scan with contrast (low sensitivity) due to the low fistula-wall enhancement and narrow and tortuous pathways . ERCP is an invasive method that has a sensitivity rate of 78%. MRCP， on the other hand， is the criterion standard and best initial test for diagnosing the fistula and visualizing the path-way； it has a sensitivity rate of 80% . Zhang et al reported in a meta-analysis that as yet there is no consensus regard-ing the treatment of choice. However， the clinicians' preferred option is conservative therapy as an initial step， despite its low success rate. Due to the ongoing sympathetic pleural ef-fusion， patients often require surgery and/or ERCP with stent placement. When possible，ERCP alone is preferred for the ini-tial treatment of pancreatic leaks and fistulas . Zhang et al recommended ERCP as the first choice of treatment after an initial short conservative treatment， due to a shorter hos-pital stay and an improved outcome.\n\n【21】In the present case， the patient had rheumatoid arthritis and complicated pancreatitis with a first hospital admission for severe inflammatory pancreatitis from gallstones. Given the severe nature of the pancreatitis， her treatment was conser-vative and cholecystectomy was deferred. Her hospitalization was prolonged and she required TPN. She had right-sided pleu-ral effusion that was suspected to be related to the inflamma-tory process from the pancreatitis. She was discharged， and nearly 1 month later she required readmission for a large re-current pleural effusion.\n\n【22】Her evaluation was restarted after the thoracentesis， as that was able to exclude effusion related to her known history of rheumatoid arthritis and was consistent with effusion related to the ongoing pancreatitis with significantly elevated amylase in the pleural fluid. Despite the laparoscopic cholecystectomy， the effusion continued to redevelop and she required further evaluation. The repeat CT and magnetic resonance imagingdemonstrated evidence of a pseudocyst and there was addi-tional concern for a pancreatic leak. ERCP was performed and showed contrast extravasation into the peritoneal cavity from the pancreatic tail. This was probably a sequela of her severe pancreatitis and is consistent with a pancreatic duct leak or disconnected pancreatic duct syndrome. Retrospectively， this was possibly the cause of the inflamed appearance of the omentum and recurring effusions. Perhaps performing ERCP earlier would have been beneficial for diagnostic purposes. In the event that ERCP stenting was ineffective， a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and cholecystectomy could have been performed simultaneously. Despite imaging and ERCP， there was no evidence to confirm the pancreatico-pleural fistula and her recurrent effusions were attributed to the ongoing pan-creatic leakage from the distal pancreas. During ERCP， a pan-creatic stent was inserted； however， she required addition-al treatment with endoscopic cystogastrostomies for internal drainage of the pancreatic pseudocysts.\n\n【23】This case report demonstrates the atypical presentation of complications from severe pancreatitis. For patients with re-cent severe pancreatitis who present with shortness of breath and refractory pleural effusion， clinicians should have high sus-picion for severe pancreatitis complications causing a pancre-atic leak. After confirming elevated amylase levels from anal-ysis of the thoracentesis fluid， MRCP is recommended as an initial diagnostic work-up if available， or ERCP as a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CCRT) is recognized worldwide as a standard freatment option for locally advanced disease not amenable to surgical resection. Aims： To compare the differences in acute toxicities and response rate between two schedules (weekly and 3-weekly divided dose cisplatin based) of concomitant chemo-radiation (CCRT) regimens in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LHNSCC). Material and Methods： Total 62 eligible patients of LHNSCC who satisfying the eligibility criteria were included in this study. After pre-treatment evaluation， patients were sequentially randomized in to fwo arms： 31 patients were taken in each arm， Arm-A (weekly concurrent cisplatin group) and Arm- B (three weekly divided dose concurrent cisplatin groups). One patient in each arm dropped out due to poor compliance. In both the arms， radiotherapy was delivered to a dose of 66-70 Gy with telecobalt machine as conventional fractionation schedule. The primary endpoints of the sfudy were to know the disease response and assessment of acute toxicity profile in both arms. Results： Among the in-field toxicity， we found mucositis as the commonest toxicity in both the arms. Incidence of grade-III (33.33% vs 40%) & grade-IV mucositis(6.66% vs 10%)， acute gastro-intestional toxicity (Nausea-33.33% vs 46.33% & vomiting-13.33% vs 20%)， and acute renal toxicity (16.66% vs 10%) were found to be slightly higher in 3-weekly arm compared to weekly arm. Our study showed that higher the incidence of neutropenia grade-I (23.33% VS16.66%) and acute skin reaction (40% vs 33.33%) occurred in weekly CCRT arm compared to 3-weekly CCRT arm. In view of treatment compliance and response rate， our study showed 3-weekly arm have higher compliance rate of scheduled chemotherapy cycles and higher response rate (CR=80% vs70%) compared to weekly arm. Conclusion： The present study concluded that， the three weekly divided dose concurrent cisplatin arms having slighfly better response rate with slightly increase in mucosal toxicity while weekly concurrent cisplatin arm having reduced requirement of feeding tube placement， colony stimulating factor and hospitalization for supportive care.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Radiotherapy， Toxicity， Response\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Head and neck cancer is the most common cancer in south-central Asia1. It constitutes about 17.7% of all cancers occur-ring in India1. Majority of them present with locoregionallyadvanced stage2. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is rec-ognized worldwide as a standard treatment option for locally advanced disease， not amenable to surgical resection. Usually， the cisplatin is given 100 mg/? every 3-weekly with radiother-apy as a most commonly used regimen in the definitive and adjuvant setting. There is a lot of significant heterogeneity in published data concerning patient selection， and some uncer-tainties are persisting regarding appropriate chemoradiotherapy regimen. In addition， the use of 3-weekly schedule has been an area of concern for the clinicians as well as for the patients because of challenges imposed by this schedule such as acute toxicities， treatment compliance and hospitalization for support-ive care. Moreover， suboptimal compliance with this schedule could jeopardize the treatment outcome， resulting in poorerloco-regional control and shorter survival. To overcome these challenges， our institute practising splitting of the 3-weekly cis-platin into 40 mg/² d1d2 and weekly cisplatin schedule with a dose of 40 mg/m² to achieve reasonable antitumor efficacy， fewer side effects， lower cost and hospitalization rates. Consid-ering the nature of the available research regarding the optimal scheduling of cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced head and neck cancer， we undertook this com-prehensive review to focus on the question regarding the use of3-weekly cisplatin (divided dose regimen as 40 mg/m² d1d2) in comparison to the weekly cisplatin (40 mg/m) concurrent with radiation therapy. The aim of this prospective study was to compare the differences in acute toxicities and Response rate between weekly cisplatin， and 3-weekly divided dose cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) regimens in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LHNSCC).\n\n【4】Subjects and Methods\n\n【5】This prospective comparative study was conducted at tertiary cancer centre of Southern Rajasthan of India during the period of May-2017 to April-2018 and was approved by the institutional ethics committee.

In the management of LAHN-SCC， a variety of chemotherapeutic agents have been used with CCRT schedules either as monotherapy or combination therapy with improved response rate such as cisplatin， methotrexate，5-FU，bleomycin， carboplatin and mitomycin. However， accord-ing to Pignon JP et al. cisplatin-based CCRT offers the best survival advantages with 8% improvement in overall survival. Therefore， using various schedules of concurrent cisplatin with RT has become an area of interest to overcome the problem of increased acute toxicity. We compared weekly 40 mg/cisplatin with 3-weekly divided dose 40 mg/2 d1d2 cisplatin concurrent with RT in definitive setting for LAHNSCC. Among the in-field toxicity， we found mucositis as the commonest toxicity in both the arms. Incidence of Grade-ⅢI mucositis (40%v/s 33.33%)and grade Ⅳ mucositis (10% v/s 6.66%) was found to be slightly higher in the 3-weekly arm compared to the weekly arm. Rawat S et al. showed similar results with our study. In our study， we found a higher incidence of acute skin reaction in weekly CCRT arm， and similar results were showed in most of the stud-ies.\n\n【74】Our study showed that higher the incidence of neutropenia in weekly CCRT arm compared to 3-weekly CCRT arm. There was no significant difference in the incidence of anaemia and thrombocytopenia in both the arms. Geeta SN et al.  showed similar results with our study.\n\n【75】In our study， we found that the incidence of acute gastroin-testinal toxicity was higher in the 3-weekly arm. The similar results were shown in other studies，i.e. Azony AE et al.  and Rawat S et al. Because of treatment compliance， our study showed that the 3-weekly arm has a higher compliance rate of scheduled CT cycles， thus having better compliance than the weekly arm. Geeta SN et al.  and Ho KF et al.  showed similar results.\n\n【76】About acute renal toxicity our study showed 3-weekly arm have higher incidence of acute renal toxicity as compared to weekly arm (16.66% vs 10%). Similar results showed in Mitra D et at.\n\n【77】A striking finding from our study was that weekly cisplatin arm patients have reduced requirement of feeding tube place-ment， colony-stimulating factor and hospitalization for support-ive care over the treatment period as compared to the 3-weekly arin.\n\n【78】In term of response rate， our study showed that 3-weekly arm has a higher response compared to weekly arm (CR=80%vs 70%). Similar results showed in Ho KF et al. ， Mitra et al.， Rawat S et al.  and Sahoo TK et al.\n\n【79】Conclusion\n\n【80】The present study concluded that the three weekly cisplatin arms having slightly better response rate with slightly increase in mucosal toxicity while weekly cisplatin arm having reduced requirement of feeding tube placement， colony-stimulating fac-tor and hospitalization for supportive care.\n\n【81】This study received no fund", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The prevalence of EF in pediatric age is estimated at 2-20%， according to the literature. Although the causes are almost always multifactorial， EF has been associated with several risk factors， such as gender， age， or etiology of admission to intensive care . EF is generally associated with a worse prognosis and higher morbidity， with increased length of stay (LOS) in intensive care， longer invasivemechanical ventilation (MV)， eventual need for tracheostomy， and even higher mortality rate . We aim to characterize the patients with EF admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit(PICU) of a Tertiary Hospital\n\n【4】Materials and Methods\n\n【5】We carried out a retrospective descriptive study of EF cases，con-sidering for this purpose， the need for reintubation in the first72 hours after extubation. All children admitted to the PICU between January 2017， and June 2020 were included. The data was collected through the review of the medical records. We considered the following variables： age， gender， type of admis-sion (urgent or scheduled)， diagnosis， type of respiratory failure， use and weaning of inotropes， sedatives and analgesics pre- and on extubation， presence of psychomotor agitation， preextuba-tion corticosteroids， the existence of complications associated with EF， time until reintubation， LOS and mortality. Data of all extubated patients during this period were analyzed and com-pared with the EF group. The Chi-square test (significance for p\n\n【6】Results\n\n【7】We admitted 1048 patients into PICU during this period， and583 needed invasive MV (55.6%). EF occurred in 22 patients， which means a prevalence of 3.8% among MV patients. About59.1% of EF patients were male， with a median age of 1.5 years(minimum 0.1 and a maximum of 15 years). No significant dif-ferences were found between EF rates according to gender or age. Among EF patients， we found 77.3% urgent admissions versus 22.7% scheduled， with 50.0% for surgical reasons， 36.4%for medical reasons and 13.6% medical-surgical admissions. The first extubation occurred more frequently on the second day of MV (33.5%) (minimum 1 and maximum 20 days)， and it hap-pened cumulatively in the first 8 days in 81% of patients. The admission diagnoses were： congenital heart disease (7/22)， res-piratory aetiology (3/22)， trauma (3/22)， haemorrhage in the context of otorhinolaryngological surgery (3/22)， brain tumor(3/22)， septic shock (1/22)， cerebral haemorrhage (1/22) and hidroeletrolitic disturbances (1/22). Sixteen patients with EF had a surgical intervention \\[correction of heart disease (4/22)； for craniectomy (3/22)； amygdalectomy (3/22)； brain tumor resection (3/22)； intracranial hematoma drainage (1/22)；palato-plasty (1/22). Postextubation stridor occurred in 10.3%(60/583) of all extubated patients， in 8.9%(50/561) of non-EF patients and 45.3%(10/22) of EF patients (54.6% of EF patients without stridor). Peri-extubation corticoids were used in 57.5% (335/583) of all patients and 88.3%(53/60) of patients with post-extubation stridor (from these 62.5% did peri-extubation corticosteroids). At the extubation time， 40.9%(9/22) of EF patients were using inotropic agents. About 76.2%(16/22) were sedated during extubation， but 11/22 were already weaning (namely under midazolam， fentanyl or dexmedetomidine). Psycho-motor agi-tation was identified in 3/22 of these patients. The majority of EF children (15/22) required reintubation in the first 4 hours post-extubation， and in 4/22 of patients， EF occurred at least two times. Pneumonia was radiologically identified in 7/22 of patients. The generality (77.3%) had no other associated compli-cations. We identified some clinical problems associated with EF patients： pneumothorax (2/22)， atelectasis (1/22)， pleural ef-fusion (1/22) and subglottic stenosis (1/22). Respiratory failure(8/22)， stridor (10/22)， and apnea (4/22) were the main causes pointed to the need for reintubation. There was a significant association between the existence of sedation and the cause of EF (p=0.0034). The average length of stay in the PICU was 12.5days (2-83 days) vs 5.6 days (average length of PICU stay during this period). Regarding long-term morbidity and mortality， two deaths occurred (9.0%) (global mortality in the same period was2.67%)； 11/22 of patients required hospitalization for further rehabilitation and 3/22 were tracheostomized. The Pediatric Risk of Mortality II (PRISMIII) of these patients had a median of 3 (minimum 0， maximum 20). We estimated a probability of death of 6.5% among the EF group.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】The prevalence of EF in our population overlaps with literature. Our study showed that patients with EF are mostly male and under the age of 2 years， with surgical admission， congenital heart disease， a higher LOS in PICU (12.5 days vs 5.6 days) and mortality (9.0% vs 2.67%). The presence of stridor was moreprevalent in EF patients (45.4% vs 8.9%)， probably increasing the risk of EF. Peri-extubation corticosteroids used in 72.7% of the EF patients seem to justify in part the existence of stridor after extubation (10.3% of all extubated patients vs 45.4% in EF patients). The higher use of corticosteroids in EF patients(72.7% vs 57.5%) is in line with higher stridor incidence among EF patients.\n\n【10】In this sample， we note the high percentage of respiratory depressant sedatives use during extubation and the ongoing need of inotropes. This percentage may be explained by the use of milrinone， an inotropic usually stopped only after extuba-tion. The increasing use of dexmedetomidine in our PICU may explain the high percentage of sedatives in the peri-extubation time.\n\n【11】Reintubation occurred mainly in the first hours after extuba-tion. In sedation weaning patients， respiratory failure was the most frequent cause of EF， while in patients without weaning， EF occurred mainly due to upper airway obstruction. We highlight the occurrence of other respiratory comorbidities after EF. Some studies point to the age as a predictor of EF， this is not the case in our sample， as corroborated in other international studies.  The hypothesis that would justify such an association is largely attributed to the anatomical and functional development of the child's respiratory system. The immaturity of the collateral venti-lation system， the high compliance (and low elastance) of the rib cage， the increase in airway resistance， and the lower prevalence of type I diaphragmatic fibres are some factors that influence the child's ability to breathe spontaneously and may contribute to extubation failure. However， the results among international studies are controversial.\n\n【12】Patients with EF have a higher length of stay， more comor-bidities， more sequelae and generally worse prognosis. These patients should have an individual plan， evolving all neces-sary medical areas， to improve the recovery and try to diminish the presence of associated comorbidities， as infections， i.e. The physical rehabilitation must be initiated as soon as possible to minimize musculoskeletal damage and may decrease the length of stay of these patients. The adequate characterization of these patients makes it possible to plan and develop multidisciplinary strategies to prevent and minimize the risk factors. \n\n【13】A weakness of our work， retrospective， is the lack of know1-edge of the calibre of the endotracheal tube.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Predominant causes of PCA infarcts include cardiac and arterial embolisms. Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) cardiomyopathy is also an extremely rare cardiopathology. Several reports describe stroke as a potential manifestation of LVNC， but bilateral PCA infarcts are likely also caused by underlying LVNC cardiomyopathy， although this has not yet been reported.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 63-year-old man presented to the emergency department of an outside hospital with acute vision loss in both eyes and dysarthria.

He underwent an emergency endovascu-lar thrombectomy at our facility. During the post-intervention stroke workup， a transthoracic echocardiogram with contrast showed left ventricle dilation， with an ejection fraction (EF) of 29%. Subsequent cardiac magnet-ic resonance imaging confirmed the presence of LVNC cardiomyopathy. He was started on therapeutic antico-agulation (apixaban) and remained stable neurologically during the 3-month followup， with some residual vi-sual field deficits.

Prompt and accurate diagnosis was pivotal to the successful management of both conditions. Prospective studies are warranted to further knowledge of LVNC pathophysi-ology and the occurrence of stroke in such patients so that comprehensive management plans can be devised.\n\n【6】Keywords： Cardiomyopathies · Infarction， Posterior Cerebral Artery· Stroke\n\n【7】Stroke， either hemorrhagic or ischemic in cause， is the second leading cause of death and the third most common worldwide cause of disability . In ischemic strokes， the middle cere bral artery is the most commonly affected branch of occlusion， whereas the incidence of infarction in the posterior cerebral ar-tery (PCA) territory or in its branches is low， with an incidence of 5-10% in a general stroke population . Specifically， the incidence of bilateral PCA occlusions is exceedingly rare and considered a devastating phenomenon presenting as cortical blindness . Cardiac or arterial embolisms are thought to be the predominant causes of PCA infarcts .\n\n【8】Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a rare cardiomyopathy characterized by prominent trabeculae and deep intertrabec-ular recesses that communicate with the left ventricular cavi-ty and a thin and compacted epicardial layer . LVNC has an incidence of 0.05% in adults ， and men are more commonly affected than women . It has an ill-defined natural history and clinical manifestation ， although it is suggested to re-sult from an intrauterine arrest of the left ventricular myocar-dium compaction process . LVNC cardiomyopathy has been associated with ischemic strokes . However， whether or not LVNC is a likely cause of bilateral PCA infarcts， is not known.\n\n【9】We present a very unique case of a patient who suffered si-multaneous acute ischemic strokes on the bilateral PCA dis-tribution， very likely due to an LVNC cardiomyopathy that was identified during the stroke workup， and after excluding oth-er causes. He underwent a successful and uncomplicated su-perselective microcatheter intra-arterial alteplase (tissue plas-minogen activator， t-PA) administration for the bilateral PCA occlusions.Rapid and timely diagnosis was pivotal to the suc-cessful management of both conditions.\n\n【10】Case Report\n\n【11】A 63-year-old man arrived at the emergency department (ED) of an outside hospital with acute vision loss in both eves and slurred speech. He had a past medical history of chronic smok-ing， hypertension， chronic back pain， acid reflux， and season-al allergy. His home medications included amlodipine (10mg daily per os)， cyclobenzaprine (10 mg， per os， 3 times daily as needed for muscle spasm)， fluticasone nasal spray (as need-ed for seasonal allergy)， naproxen (375 mg per os every 8 h as needed for chronic back pain)， and omeprazole (40 mg per os daily). He reached the ED within 15 min of his acute symp-tom onset. These symptoms were never experienced before， were sudden in onset， and with no pain associated with the vision loss. Clinically， he did not show any signs of acute heartfailure (HF) that were exacerbated upon presentation， includ-ing any lack of shortness of breath or pitting edema.\n\n【12】While he was awake and alert upon arrival to the ED， he was hypertensive， with a systolic blood pressure of 190-200mmHg. His random blood glucose level was 102 mg/dl. Urgent neu-rological assessment， measured by the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was 4 (3 for total blindness， and1 for speech abnormality). This necessitated an emergent code stroke activation. His electrocardiogram showed a normal si-nus rhythm and subsequent telemetry monitoring did not re-veal any arrhythmia. An emergent computerized tomography(CT) of the head showed no evidence of intracranial hemor-rhage， while a CT angiogram of the head and neck showed bi-lateral right P2 and left P3 PCA focal occlusions， respectively， with no evidence of atherosclerosis or thrombosis within the basilar artery.\n\n【13】The patient received an intravenous t-PA (alteplase 0.9 mg/kg)， and was transferred to our comprehensive stroke center. Because of the distal location of the occlusions and the pres-ence of systemic t-PA therapy on-board， the patient under-went a successful and uncomplicated superselective pharma-cological thrombectomy treatment via microcatheter， delivering intra-arterial t-PA infusion (3 mg each for the left and right P2 segments). This resulted in recanalization of the right P2branches，and improved flow within the left P2 distal branch-es. The successful reperfusion of the bilateral PCA occlusions caused significant improvement of the antegrade flow within the corresponding PCA vascular territories .\n\n【14】As part of the stroke workup， the telemetry during hospital-ization did not show any evidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) or any other arrhythmia. The subsequent 30-day cardiac monitor also did not identify any cardiac arrhythmia. The thrombophil-ia panel (or hypercoagulable panel) was also unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain post-interven-tion demonstrated the non-salvageable areas of ischemia in the bilateral PCA vascular distribution .\n\n【15】A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) with contrast revealed a dilated left ventricle (LV)， and a severely decreased systolic func-tion with an EF of 29% with a concern for LVNC . The patient's brain natriuretic peptide level was grossly abnor-mal (1459 pg/mL； the normal value is less than 100 pg/mL). He had elevated low-density lipoprotein levels (117 mg/dL) but his HbAlc levels， anti-nuclear antibody titer， erythrocyte sed-imentation rate， and C-reactive protein levels were all within normal limits. A subsequent cardiac MRI revealed hypertra-beculation of the LV， meeting the criteria for noncompaction focally at the apex (the ratio of noncompacted to compacted myocardium was above 2.3)， with no intraventricular throm-bus . The imaging also revealed a dilated LV， globallyhypokinetic， with no delayed gadolinium enhancement， with an overall LV-EF of 25%.\n\n【16】The patient passed a swallow (dysphagia) evaluation and was started on daily aspirin (81 mg) and atorvastatin (80 mg). After a discussion with cardiology， the decision was made to start him on therapeutic anticoagulation 7 days post-stroke to min-imize the risk of hemorrhagic transformation in the infarct-ed areas. The patient was subsequently started on apixaban(preferred， as it has a lower risk of bleeding given the size of the stroke)， and remained stable neurologically at the 3-month outcome check， with a residual left visual field cut. His car-diac outcome also showed improvement， with a subsequent stress test not revealing any cardiac ischemia， and followup2-dimensional (2D) echocardiography (within 2 months) show-ing an improved EF of 40%， which was likely due to the initi-ated guideline-directed medical therapy for HF.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】Several reports describe stroke as a potential manifestation of LVNC cardiomyopathy ， but LVNC cardiomyopathy as a likely cause for a PCA infarct is extremely rare . This is the first report， to the best of our knowledge， that identi-fies LVNC cardiomyopathy as a highly suspected cause for si-multaneous bilateral PCA infarcts. We consider LVNC cardio-myopathy to be a likely cause in this particular case because no other abnormality (such as AF， or hypercoagulable state) was identified. Furthermore， we speculate that his underlying medication usage of a calcium channel blocker and non-ste-roidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) did not likely contrib-ute to his HF， given the lack of history of medication overuse，limited use of NSAIDs， and his previous tolerance to amlodip-ine for his chronic hypertension， without any direct complica-tions. Our patient did not show any clinical signs or symptoms of HF at the time of admission. Therefore， after excluding car-diac arrhythmia， we strongly speculate that the presence of LVNC cardiomyopathy likely contributed to the patient's strokes.\n\n【19】The occurrence of stroke in patients with LVNC cardiomyopa-thy is 1-2% per year with a total risk of thromboembolism of about 21-38%. While PCA territory lesions caused by var-ious stroke mechanisms are less well defined compared with those of other vascular territories， cardioembolic etiology may produce significant infarcts due to a lack of collateral flow in the acute process . The frequency of thromboembolism is variable in adults (13-24%)， with AF or systolic dysfunction known to increase the risk of cardioembolic stroke . Two prospective studies on adult patients with LVNC cardiomyopa-thy report a 21-24% risk of cerebral embolism during the fol-lowup period ， which is considered to be a higher risk than that in the non-LVNC population， considering the typical cu-mulative recurrent stroke risk is considered to be 3.1% at 30days or 11.1% at l year .\n\n【20】We suspect that the bilateral PCA occlusions manifested in our patient as a result of a potential cardioembolic event due to LVNC cardiomyopathy. The clinical manifestations of LVNC cardiomyopathy exist on a wide spectrum， ranging from as-ymptomatic to the classic triad of HF， arrhythmias， or throm-boembolic events . Cardioembolism as a result of rare car-diomyopathies can manifest as stroke， likely as a result of atrial arrhythmias or impaired EF . Our patient did exhibit a severely compromised systolic function with an EF of 29%during the stroke workup period. The LV dysfunction is mostcommonly reported and attributed to diminished microcircu-lation in the subendocardial layer of the heart . A recent meta-analysis indicated that the LV-EF， and not the extent of trabeculation， was an important determinant of adverse out-comes in LVNC patients . In patients with embolic events， in vivo blood clots within the noncompacted layer have been documented . The simultaneous use of echocardiogra-phy， either transthoracic or transesophageal， along with car-diac MRI， can tremendously help improve the accuracy of the findings and increase the sensitivity of testing . Diagnosis of LVNC cardiomyopathy is primarily based on 2D echocardio-graphic findings， with proposed diagnostic criteria suggested by 3 different authors .\n\n【21】Owing to a reduced EF observed in our patient， anticoagu-lation therapy was initiated to reduce the risk of potential thromboembolism. Anticoagulation is recommended，espe-cially in patients with a history of thromboembolism， AF， or reduced EF . The CHADS，/CHADS，-Vasc score may play a role in decision-making regarding oral anticoagulation for pa-tients with LVNC cardiomyopathy . Due to limited knowl-edge about LVNC pathophysiology， no specific management is currently recommended， with existing approaches focusing on symptom-targeted therapy . Some investigators recom-mend long-term prophylactic anticoagulation for all patients with LVNC cardiomyopathy， regardless of whether they have experienced thromboembolic complications， and regardless of the degree of LV dysfunction. However， such a course should beapproached with prudence， after carefully weighing the bene-fits versus risks to identify those who would most likely ben-efit from this strategy . Patients with LVNC and HF with reduced EF are treated according to ACC/AHA guidelines for chronic HF . This includes initiation of beta-blockers， ACE inhibitors/AT2 receptor antagonists， and mineralocorticoid re-ceptor blockers (spironolactone or eplerenone). If after initia-tion of pharmacotherapy， HF patients still have reduced sys-tolic function (<35%) and are symptomatic at 3 months'time， consideration should be given to primary prevention of sud-den cardiac death and cardiac resynchronization therapy .\n\n【22】Conclusions\n\n【23】Our report is distinct， as it presents 2 exceedingly rare events in a patient： the occurrence of simultaneous bilateral PCA in-farcts and LVNC cardiomyopathy. The LVNC was identified by TTE and cardiac MRI findings during the stroke workup. Prompt and accurate diagnosis was pivotal to the successful manage-ment of both conditions.

Multiple classifica-tions have been described； however， the exact etiology remains unknown. Preoperative diagnosis is not com-mon， as imaging cannot distinguish the disease from other processes， and biopsy is insufficient to provide the architecture of the mass， which is necessary for diagnosis. Unicentric retroperitoneal disease has been de-scribed， and management includes complete resection of the mass， which is usually curative.\n\n【2】Case Report： A 34-year-old previously healthy woman presented with hematuria. Evaluation revelated a retroperitoneal mass that was abutting the duodenum and head of the pancreas. Biopsy failed to provide a diagnosis， so laparo-scopic resection was performed. Postoperative diagnosis was consistent with unicentric Castleman’s disease. Conclusions： Castleman’s disease is an uncommon process， and one that is difficult to diagnose. Unicentric Castleman's disease should always be a differential diagnosis of solitary retroperitoneal masses that are well-demarcated， as treatment can be curative with surgical resection.\n\n【3】MeSH Keywords： Laparoscopes · Medical Oncology·Retroperitoneal Neoplasms\n\n【4】Castleman's disease (CD) is a rare，benign， lymphoproliferative disorder first described in 1954 as a“peculiar form of lymph-node hyperplasia” at Massachusetts General Hospital . Benjamin Castleman further described the disease as unicen-tric versus multicentric . The unicentric and multicentric variants are classified based on the number of lymph nodes that are involved in the disease process. The most common location for these enlarged lymph nodes is the mediastinum(in 70% of patients)； other locations include the neck (15%)， abdomen and pelvis including the retroperitoneum (12%)，and axilla (3%) . The presentation of unicentric CD (UCD) var-ies， with some patients being asymptomatic. The literature dif-fers on the rate of symptomatic presentation of UCD， with one study showing 28.6% of patients being symptomatic ，and other findings of symptoms in 69% of patients . In this report， we present an unusual case of a para-duodenal， peri-pancreatic， retroperitoneal UCD.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】A 34-year-old previously healthy woman presented with per-sistent hematuria following an uncomplicated vaginal delivery， and she denied any other symptoms. Abdominal and pelvic exams did not show any abnormalities. Basic laboratory work-up was done and results were within normal range. An ab-dominal ultrasound was done， which showed a 6.5x4.7 cm hypoechoic mass adjacent to the upper pole of the right kid-ney. To further evaluate this mass， an abdominal MRI was performed， which showed a 6.2x9x4.5 cm solid mass locat-ed between the liver， right kidney， and duodenum. Based on these findings， it was concluded that the mass was retroper-itoneal. Furthermore， the mass had a hypointense signal on T1 and hyperintense signal on T2， with enhancement after Ⅳcontrast administration.\n\n【7】Radiologic diagnosis as to the nature of this mass was incon-clusive， so a CT scan was recommended to view any calcifi-cation in the mass and to see whether there was extension into the duodenum. An abdominal CT showed a 6x8.5x4.2 cm solid， well-delineated mass with marked enhancement with lV contrast. The mass was shown to be retroperitoneal，adja-cent to the right kidney and in close proximity to the duode-num. It was also shown that the mass was well-vascularized. with a large vein arising from it. A chest CT scan was normal.\n\n【8】The differential diagnosis at this point was neuroendocrine tu-mor versus gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)， considering the close proximity of the mass to the duodenum， which could be the origin of this mass. A work-up for a secretory neuroen-docrine tumor， including blood and urine metanephrine andnormetanephrine， urine epinephrine， norepinephrine， and do-pamine， was negative.\n\n【9】An endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided biopsy was planned， and endoscopic evaluation showed an 8x5 cm， well-demarcated， hypoechoic mass with few hyperechoic spots and small vascula-ture impinging on the wall of the 3rd portion of the duodenum. Doppler evaluation showed multiple vessels traversing the mass. A histologic evaluation of the biopsy did not show any evidence of GIST or any other carcinoma； it showed multiple lymphoid cells with no characteristics of lymphoma， but that diagnosis could not be ruled out. A decision was made to excise the mass lap-aroscopically for both diagnostic and therapeutic advantages.\n\n【10】In preparation for the surgery， and considering the vascular-ity of the mass， a triphasic abdominal CT was done， which showed the para-duodenal enhancing mass with a small fo cus of hypoattenuation within the mass that appeared to be abutting the posterior aspect of the duodenum， with no clear evidence of invasion. It also showed the mass compressing the underlying inferior vena cava (IVC)， with a clear fat plane between them and no invasion of the IVC.\n\n【11】The procedure was conducted with the patient in the lithot-omy position， using 2x12 mm ports in the right paramedian area and right subcostal area， and 2x5 mm ports in the epi-gastric area mid-distance between the xyphoid and umbilicus. Exploration of the abdomen showed the retroperi-toneal mass anterior to the right kidney and IC， pushing the duodenum and the head of the pancreas anteriorly and medi-ally . The mass was very well-vascularized and sup-plied by the medial branches of the renal artery and venous drainage into the medial branches of the renal vein . The medial branches of the renal vessels were carefully dis-sected， clipped， and divided . The mass was dissect-ed and freed from all its attachments. Large lymph nodes werefound medial to the mass and were also resected. The proce-dure was conducted in 120 minutes ， with no intraoperative compli-cations and minimal blood loss.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Castleman's disease is a rare entity with a variety of subtypes described and an unclear etiology. Clinical classification of the disease is based on the number of regions of enlarged lymph nodes  and can be described as either unicentric (one region)\nor multicentric (multiple regions). The multicentric variant (MCD) can be further subclassified based on Human Herpesvirus-8(HHV-8) status of the patient， as either HHV-8-positive MCD or HHV-8-negative MCD， which itself has 2 variants. POEMS-associated HHV-8-negative MCD presents with polyneuropathy， organomegaly， endocrinopathy， monoclonal plasma cell disor-der， and skin changes. Idiopathic HHV-8-negative MCD can ei-ther be with or without TAFRO syndrome (thrombocytopenia， anasarca， myelofibrosis， renal dysfunction， and organomegaly). Histologically， CD can be divided into 3 subtypes， the most common being hyaline-vascular (HV-CD) type (76% to 91%of cases)， plasma cell (PC-CD) variant (9% to 24% of cases)， and a rare mixed type . Our patient had a unicentric dis-ease with a hyaline-vascular histologic subtype. The etiology of UCD is not currently known， but there are 3 hypotheses as to the origin of this disease ： viral， neoplastic， and reactive inflammatory mechanisms. The literature has more evidence pointing towards a neoplastic cause， where one study found monoclonality in 76% of UCD cases .\n\n【14】The incidence and prevalence of the disease are unclear； but one study showed the incidence of all forms of CD to be 21in one million ， with estimated cases in the United States ranging from 30 000 to 100 000 . UCD mainly occurs in the third and fourth decades of life， with an average age of 35years， and a slight predilection to females . The location of CD as retroperitoneal is found in 11-12% of cases ， but the literature review we conducted showed only 3 cases of peripancreatic UCD  that were below the pancreas， and 1 report of duodenal CD . Based on our literature re-view， the location of the disease in our patient appears to be unique， as the combination of the mass being retroperitoneal， peripancreatic， and para-duodenal has not yet been described. Concerning the presentation of our patient with isolated he-maturia， only 2 other case reports were found with similar symptoms .\n\n【15】Diagnosis of UCD can be challenging， as patients are either asymptomatic or have symptoms related to the mass effect ， and many cases have been found incidentally on physical exam or imaging . Imaging can be useful to delineate the lo-cation of the mass and to determine whether there is inva-sion of any structures， but the diagnosis of retroperitoneal UCD cannot be made based on imaging alone， as it cannot be distinguished from neuroendocrine tumors， lymphomas， or paragangliomas . As in our case， biopsy is usually not di-agnostic and generally is not recommended due to the risk of seeding and spread of the tumor， and risk of bleeding in the hyper-vascular mass . However， biopsy is useful when ra-diologic diagnosis is inconclusive and when a preoperative di-agnosis could change the choice of management . The di-agnosis of lymphoma had to be ruled out in our patient， as further work-up and management would have changed the decision to remove the mass. Furthermore， EUS-guided biop sy has been proven effective and relatively safe for retroper-itoneal masses that are in close proximity to the bowel. Ultrasound， CT， and MRI have all been described for evaluation of retroperitoneal masses and the diagnosis of UCD . Ultrasound is useful for assessing the vascularity of the le-sion by use of Doppler technique. CT imaging of retroperito-neal UCDs shows a well-defined mass， with a variable mor-phology， which is usually heterogeneously enhancing with Ⅳcontrast  and is useful to view calcifications， which are rare in UCD . MRl evaluation typically shows hypointensesignaling on T1-weighted images and an increased signal on T2-weighted images . Even with these radiologic find-ings being described in retroperitoneal UCD， diagnosis is still dependent on postoperative histology .\n\n【16】There is a consensus in the literature that surgical resec-tion of UCD is curative， with an extremely low recurrence rate . The 5-year survival rate ranges between90% and 100% ， and the 5-year disease-free rate has been reported to exceed 80% . For unresectable UCD，par-tial resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy was shown to be effective in a small case series . Other proposed ther-apies include anti-interleukin 6 (IL-6)， which has been impli-cated in the pathogenesis of CD . Generally， the progno-sis of UCD is excellent， with a 10-year mortality rate of only5%. Laparoscopic approach to retroperitoneal UCD offers a safe and effective method for resection， and it also bene-fits the patient with a lower rate of postoperative pain and complications ， which drove our decision to pursue a lap-aroscopic approach.\n\n【17】Conclusions\n\n【18】Castleman's disease is an uncommon disease with multiple subtypes， an unknown etiology， and a variable presentation. The case presented in this report is unusual in the presenta-tion with isolated hematuria and the unique location of peri-pancreatic and para-duodenal UCD. Resection of the mass Was uncomplicated， and if this case follows the course of UCD de-scribed in the literature，then resection was curative. CD is an unusual diagnosis； however， it should always be a differen-tial diagnosis of well-demarcated masses that are either as-ymptomatic or with symptoms related to mass effect. Further studies are needed to clearly define the etiology of the disease and the best course of treatment for CD patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Lesions are usually solitary and can be treated surgically. Exceptional cases of Kaposi’s have started to gather， and an example of such is the one we have reported. Here we establish a case report on Kaposi’s sarcoma in a young immune-competent male patient who presented with exclusively cutaneous lesions on the axilla and right side of the chest without involving the lungs or any other viscera. The clinical examination， radiological investigations， biopsy and antibody tests were done to evaluate the presumptive diagnosis and the relevant literature reviewed.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Kaposi's sarcoma， exclusive skin involvement， immuno-competent，young\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Kaposi's sarcoma is a low-grade mesenchymal tumour which mainly affects the skin but later extends to viscera via blood and lymphatic vessels . An infection causes it with either the Human Herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8)， Human Papillomavirus 16，Hu-man Papilloma Virus 18 or the Human Cytomegalovirus . It occurs in four types， namely， classic， endemic， immunosup-pression therapy-related， an epidemic. Classic Kaposi’s tends to affect older men， is usually slow growing， and affects the legs while endemic Kaposi's sarcoma is found to be a more ag-gressive type usually presenting in young adult males in AfricaImmunosuppression therapy-related type generally occurs in people following organ transplantation and mostly affects the skin.\n\n【4】Characteristically， Kaposi has been associated with AIDS for centuries， but now and then， new cases of non-HIV affected patients sprout up， leading to further studies over the matter. Bisexual and homosexual men are usually found to be affected with Kaposi more than those with other sexual orientations， but， this number is now decreasing  as a variety of cases are now becoming a part of the literature.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】A 29-year-old male， the resident of Karachi， Pakistan， an ex-smoker (since 1 year) and labourer by profession with no history of known co-morbidities， was presented to the Dermatology department of Dr Ruth K.M.Pfau Civil Hospital in December2018 with the complain of multiple solid elevated lesions on the right side of his chest and axilla for the last 5 to 6 months.\n\n【7】According to the patient， he was in his usual state of health when six months back， he first noticed these lesions. The le-sions were dome-shaped，skin-coloured，and painless with no overlying scales， appearing on the right side of the chest accom-panied by itching. No other lesions were present anywhere on the body at that time. For the past three months， he noticed that the lesions increased in number and covered whole right side of chest， axilla and scapular region. The colour of these lesions changed from skin-colour to pink and brown. These new lesions were associated with pain， itch， burning sensation with no discharge of any sort. One month ago， he observed two small painless swellings on his left axilla， which had no association with itch， pain， burning sensation or discharge. He undertook homoeopathic treatment， which reduced the burning sensation and itchiness but had no effect on the size of skin lesions. The patient also reported unintentional weight loss of 3kgs in the last four months. His father had diabetes. His past drug， blood transfusion history and systemic review were also unremarkable. He is married and denies any sexual contact outside wedlock.\n\n【8】On general physical examination， the patient appeared to be of average height and built and well-oriented with time and place. His axillary lymph nodes were palpable bilaterally， firm in consistency and up to 3 cm in size. They were slightly erythe-matous， non-tender， with normal temperature， mobile and not attached to underlying structures. On cutaneous examination， multiple nodular lesions were present on the right side of the chest， axilla and scapular region . Lesions were pink tobrown in colour and varied in size from 1cm to 8cm， non-tender， not warm and firm in consistency. Rest of the general examina-tion was unremarkable. On systemic examination， the abdomen was soft and tender. Splenomegaly was noted around three fingerbreadths below the costal margin. There were no other significant findings.\n\n【9】Baseline tests and several investig ations were ordered to in-vestigate the case which included the complete blood count(CBC)， erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)， urinalysis， Urea， creatinine and electrolytes (UCE) and viral profile. All of them were found to be unremarkable. Liver function tests (LFTs) were also done with resultant SGPT (ALT) at 50 U/L， SGOT (AST) at45 U/L and Gamma-Glutamyl Transpeptidase (GGT) at 48 U/L. This showed that AST and GGT were above the upper limit of the normal range. Total protein and protein Albumin/Globulin(A/G) ratio were also elevated.\n\n【10】Abdominal ultrasound showed splenomegaly measuring up to 14 cm with homogenous parenchymal echo pattern. No focal mass was seen， and the splenic vein was not dilated. A chestX-ray was also ordered， which showed numerous soft tissue nodules on the right lateral chest wall. HlV ELISA and Hepatitis B and C viral markers came out to be negative. Chest and Abdominal CT scan were also ordered. Irregular prominent subcutaneous thickening and multiple peripherally enhancing soft tissue nodules were noted in the right anterolateral chest wall with co-existing chest wall oedema. Multiple enlarged confluent bilateral axillary lymph nodes measuring 2.5 x 4.4cm were seen. Spleen and multiple mesenteric lymph nodes were enlarged， measuring about 14 cm and 1.3x1.0 cm， respectively. No other anomaly was noticed.\n\n【11】Skin biopsy was obtained in which Acid-fast Bacilli (AFB) and fungal cultures were negative. Epidermis appeared to be intact. Underlying dermis revealed non-encapsulated， well cir-cumscribed， vasoformative neoplastic lesions exhibiting prolif-erating spindle cells forming slit-like vascular spaces filled with red blood cells and PAS-D positive hyaline globules. Frequent mitoses were also observed 一. IHC markers showed neg-ative for actin， desmin， caldesmon， S-100 but diffuse positive for CD31 and CD34. The morphological and IHC markers pointed towards Kaposi Sarcoma.\n\n【12】Biopsy of axillary lymph node showed partial effacement of nodal architecture and was replaced by ill-circumscribed， va-soformative， neoplastic lesion composed of sheets of atypical spindle cells with moderate eosinophilic cytoplasm. Florid ex-travasations of RBCs， atypical mitoses and PAS-D positive hya-line globules were also observed . Findings were about those of Kaposi's Sarcoma.\n\n【13】This provisional diagnosis led to further investigations. HlV antibody test， Treponemal test for Syphilis，CD3+/CD4， CD3+/CD8+， T4： T8 ratio， serum IgG，IgM， IgA and CMV were all normal. The final diagnosis was settled to be 'Classic (Spo-radic) Kaposi Sarcoma'.\n\n【14】Paclitaxel 120mg， Decadron 8mg and Ondansetron 2mg were given intravenously every week and the patient has improved since then with a marked reduction in size and number of the lesions and no new lesions were erupted. The patient is non-compliant， but still visits Dermatology OPD of Civil Hospital Karachi sometimes. No recurrence has been noted. Unfortu-nately， HHV-8 testing is not available in Pakistan. Hence， the corresponding status could not be determined.\n\n【15】The classic type of Kaposi presents as red-purple papules or nodules or a combination of both on hands and feet . The cellularity of all the types of Kaposi is of spindle and vascular type with slit partitions assorting within the spindles .\n\n【16】A biopsy is used as a prime source of investigation， and all the types are treated with either chemotherapy radiotherapy or a combination of both .Radiotherapy has shown to work spectacularly because of the extreme radio-sensitive nature of the lesions . However， in one report of New York， 1991， it has been documented that in about 20% cases lesions still did not regress after an extensive therapy through the presumed regression rate was 68% . In our setup， patients with Kaposi’s are usually from a rural background with meagre knowledge on sexually transmitted diseases， and many still do not approach hospitals because of confidentiality of these diseases due to religious reasons. Hence， there is no collection of data on the topic of Kaposi， but the residents and senior doctors are bows exploring the ghastly disease in detail.\n\n【17】In one of the reports published in Journal of European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology ， multiple non-tender， reddish-violaceous papules， infiltrated plaques， nodules and tumours measuring from 0.5 to 4 cm were found in a heterosexual 40-year-old man. Lesions were present on the feet， including the toes and soles， the calves， thighs， the dorsa of the hands， fingers， palms， the ears and the nose with lymphedema on both legs extending to the thighs . In a different report， a non-HIV infected 45 years old female presented with multiple painful and livid reddish-brown papules， nodules and plaques on both lower limbs which pro-ceeded on to involve the index finger . A multiple reports published in the Journal of Dermatology Case Reports  published a variety of cases seen in Turkey with variable cutaneous presentations of Kaposi， one of them， a 75-year-old male found to be affected with HHV-8 on laboratory testing， had a purplish 1.5x2 cm nodule on the right ankle， a 27 year non-HlV affected heterosexual male who presented with inguinal swelling at first but later on had developed reddish-purple le-sions on the helix of the right ear， retro-auricular region， the mental region and the tip of the nose， multiple mobile lym-phadenopathies， while， the third case of a 73-year-old hetero-sexual man with normal laboratory investigations had reddish purple lesions bilaterally on the dorsum of the feet and toes. No visceral involvement was found in either of the cases discussed.\n\n【18】In our patient， who distinctively reported at an age much younger than the one in which a non-HIV Kaposi affected pa-tient reports， we found the lesions specifically appearing in the right chest at first near the axilla and then leading on to in-volve the whole right side of the chest， axilla and right scapula. The cases reported above barely exhibited a lesion on the chest， mostly involving the extremities， like the patient presented to us. It is interesting to see that this man also has a normal sexual orientation and is immune-competent. His case was concluded to be Kaposi's sarcoma based on morphological features since HHV-8 testing is unfortunately not available in Pakistan.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Prompt diagnosis and surgical intervention is demanded even if operative mortality is between 24 and 35% . Many different surgical techniques are used for repairing LVFWR：infarctectomy and ventricle reconstruction with patch， interrupted pledged sutures or reinforced linear Teflon strips， pericardial patches secured to the heart with biological glues utilizing or not anchoring epicardial sutures . The most appropriate surgical technique remains controversial because experience in treating this pathology is limited.\n\n【8】CASE REPORT\n\n【9】A 72-year-old man with severe chest pain and cardiac tamponade with cardiogenic shock was admitted to the hospital on August 17， 2005. At admission， patient blood pressure was 40/20 mmHg， pulse - 130. The patient developed circulatory collapse. Troponin I level was13.3 mg/L. Signs of a free wall rupture with pericardial effusion were evident on the echocardiogram during echocardiography. The patient with the diagnosis of ventricular rupture and cardiac tamponade was imme-diately transferred to the operating room. Coronary angiography was not performed due to critical condi-tion of the patient. Median sternotomywas performed， and 500 mL of fresh blood and clots were removed from the pericardium. An infarcted area，3×5 cm in size， in the left ventricular lateral wall without obvi-ous orifice of rupture seen was found. Using off-pump coronary bypass technique， the repair was performed with pericardial patch， which was fixed on the wall of the left ventricle using continuous 4-0 Prolene suture.\n\n【10】Patient's postoperative period was complicated. On the third day after the initial surgery， massive bleeding began through the chest tube. Emergency sternotomy was performed again. Blood and clots were evacuated from the pericardial cavity followed by establishment of cardiopulmonarybypass. At the re-operation， necrosis of the myocardium (approximately 3.5×6.0 cm in size) along the first marginal coronary artery was found. After incision in the middle of the necrotic myocardium， the left ventricle was opened without excision of necrotic tissue and was carefully inspected. Twelve separate pledgets (6×12 mm) at the border of the necrotic tissue were placed . Teflon patch(about8×5 cm) was applied over the necrotic area. The corners of the Teflon patch was sutured using earlier in-serted sutures around all necrotic myocardium . The postoperative period was successful.\n\n【11】Postoperative coronary angiography revealed oc-clusion of the marginal branch of the circumflex ar-tery . Other arteries were without significant stenosis.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n\n【13】Surgical treatment of ventricular rupture has varied over time and is often individualized depending on the state of the tear and the presence of concomitant lesions. According to autopsy examination and macro-and microscopic features of myocardial rupture after myocardium infarction， four morphologie types of myo-cardial rupture are described： type I rupture involves an almost direct trajectory with little dissection and bloody infiltration of the myocardium； type II exibits a multicanalicular trajectory and widespread myocar-dial dissection and bloody infiltration； in type III， the orifice of rupture is protected by an intraventricular thrombus or a pericardial symphysis； type IV involves incomplete epicardial， endocardial， or intramyocar-dial rupture which is never transmural . Successfulsurgical treatment of this condition was first reportedin literature in 1972 . The surgical therapy was aimed at urgent relief of tamponade and closure of ventricular wall defect. Differenttechniques have been described in the literature. In the conventional approach， infarc-tectomy is followed by replacement using a prosthetic patch or direct closure under cardiopulmonarybypass. Left ventricular free wall rupture can be but-tressed by direct mattress suture with Teflon felt. The suture line must be along the nonischemic area， and transmural stitches are required . If the su-tures are placed in the necrotic myocardium， tearing of myocardium can occur. Suturelesstechniques fixing the patch using fibrin glue and collagen hemostats with the patch showed some degree of success， especially when bleeding is just oozing and the patient’s condi-tion does not require cardiopulmonary bypass support. Several authors have reported good clinical results using tissue adhesive materials to the edematousfriable myocardium. Running sutures is more likely to prevent rerupture than sutureless techniques. However，there is a caution associated with the sutureless technique. If reoperation for coronary artery bypass grafting needs to be performed， identification and exposure of the coronary artery might be difficult due to the widely and deeply piled collagen hemostats .\n\n【14】We obtained good clinical results at the reoperation using our repair technique. After incision in the middle of the necrotic myocardium， the left ven-tricle was opened， and without excision of necrotic tissue， separate Ethibond sutures with pledgets were placed at the border of the necrotic tissue of the en-docardium， and surface of the wall was covered with\n\n【15】Teflon patch over the necrotic area. The corners of the Teflon patch was sutured using earlier inserted sutures around all necrotic myocardium.\n\n【16】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【17】Our experience shows that surgical repair of left ven-tricular free wall rupture with pericardial patch fixed to epicardium using sutures is not safe technique and does not prevent rerupture. Surgical repair of left ventricular muscle rupture with a prosthetic patch sutured at the borders of intact tissue using earlier inserted sutures significantly prevents further tearing of dead myocardium.\n\n【18】Frame 30 of 44", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Although several tricks might help to do so (e.g.， balloon trap of retro wire in second guiding， balloon trap of retro wire in native coronary artery， and use of antegrade extension to approximate the antegrade conduit to the retro-grade gear)， these tricks cannot always be applied， especially in patients with poor access. Also， puncturing， knuckling， and crossing of the distal CTO cap (or the aorta as described in 1 of the cases) sometimes needs a lot of backup of the microcatheter.\n\n【2】Case Report： We describe 3 cases in which we used a novel telescopic technique with 5F Guidion (IMDS) supported retro-grade Corsair (Asahie) advancement in complex CTO lesions.\n\n【3】Conclusions： The telescopic Corsair in 5F Guidion may offer the support needed to end successfully in these situations.\n\n【4】MeSH Keywords： Coronary Artery Disease · Coronary Occlusion· Percutaneous Coronary InterventionRetrograde crossing of the chronic total occlusion (CTO) with a microcatheter is one of the key steps in retrograde recanali-zation of CTOs. Sometimes， advancing microcatheters through septal/epicardial connectors or crossing the distal CTO cap proves very challenging. Strong microcatheter support is nee-ded to end successfully in these situations. We describe 3 cas-es of 5F Guidion (IMDS0) supported retrograde Corsair (Asahi@) advancement in complex CTO lesions.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】Case 1\n\n【7】An 81-year-old male patient presented with worsening heart failure due to anteroseptalischemia. The diagnostic angiogram showed an occlusion of the heavily calcified mid-LAD just be-hind S1 and D1， in addition to a severe stenosis in the distal Cx and mid RAC . The J-CTO score was 3 (blunt stump， severe calcification， >20 mm CTO length) . There was a nice epicardial connection from the marginal branch to the apical LAD . In the first procedure， with retro-grade approach， we managed to advance a Corsair microcath-eter up to the occlusion， and we were able to cross the lesion with a Gaia Ill wire (Asahi) to reach the antegrade guiding. Unfortunately， the retrograde Corsair could not cross the le-sion due lack of support. Use of a balloon trap of the Gaia ⅢII within the guiding or within the LAD was not possible due to limited access size (6Fr， due to peripheral artery disease). The procedure was stopped and rescheduled. In the second pro-cedure， the 150-cm Corsair was inserted into a 5F Guidion tobe used as a telescopic device. The Guidion was placed in the marginal branch (together with the Corsair) up to the take-off of the epicardial connection . The Corsair was fur-ther advanced and the occlusion was crossed. This time， with the extra support of the Guidion， the Corsair could be spun through the calcified CTO and into the antegrade guiding. An RG3 wire was advanced and externalized. Since we were work-ing with 1 guiding， the Corsair was removed from the RG3 and the RG3 was used for antegrade ballooning and stenting， withgood result . Procedure safety characteristics can be found in Table 1.\n\n【8】Case 2\n\n【9】A female patient， age 72 years， was referred for a second re-canalization attempt of an ostial occluded RAC. The diagnostic images showed an ostial occluded RAC. The J-CTO score was 5(blunt stump， calcified， long CTO， takeoff with a bend， 2nd at-tempt). There was a good septal connection， which was also used in the first attempt . The first attempt failed be-cause the retrograde wire could not be externalized freely into the aorta (for snaring). Upon the second attempt， a Guidion5F with 150-cm Corsair was used to engage the septal con-nection . Once the septal was crossed with a Sion wire， the Corsair was advanced up to the RV branch (distal cap of the occlusion) with a low amount of resistance. After dis-tal cap puncture from the RV branch with a Confianza pro 12(Asahi@)， the Corsair could be advanced close to the calcified ostium of the RAC， over a Fielder XT-A (Asahi@) knuckle. Very stiff wires were used to cross into the aorta： Confianza pro12， ProVia 15 (Medtronic)， and， finally， Stingray needle (Boston Scientific). The Guidion-supported Corsair allowed puncture with these wires. Only after antegrade puncturing (Confianza pro 12)， advancement of Corsair over a Fielder XT-A knuckle， ballooning of the ostium and post-ostial segment， the wire could be externalized freely into the aorta. The RG3 wire wasthen snared (EV-3 snare) and externalized . After this maneuver， antegrade ballooning and stenting was possi-ble， with good result . Procedure safety characteris-tics can be found in Table 1.\n\n|  | Contrast used  | Radiation dose  | Procedure time  | Fluoro time  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Case 1  | 205ml  | 1519mGy  | 160 min  | 4080 s  |\n| Case2  | 310ml  | 964 mGy  | 195 min  | 6024s  |\n| Case3  | 324ml  | 2281 mGy  | 227 min  | 4776S  |\n\n【11】Case 3\n\n【12】A male patient， age 58 years， was hospitalized urgently with unstable angina due to a CTO of the LAD just distal to the first diagonal branch (D1). After 2 unsuccessful previous attempts to open the CTO， the patient presented in our center for the 3rd attempt. Bilateral injection through an EBU 8F antegrade and AL1 7F SH retrograde showed the CTO of the LAD . The J-CTO score was 1 (re-do procedure). The length of the oc-cluded segment was estimated at 10 mm. Collateral connec-tions were present. There was a tortuous septal connection(CC1) and a nice apical epicardial connection from the PDA to the D2 (CC1). In the antegrade attempt to cross the occlusion， the Fielder XT in a NHancer ProX was going into the subinti-mal space. The NHancer ProX was exchanged for the NHancer RX dual-lumen catheter to perform parallel wiring using Gaia First and Gaia Second in escalation. It was impossible to cross the hard proximal cap. The decision was made to move to the retrograde approach via the epicardial collateral， using a Corsair 150 cm and a Sion Blue. The wire crossed the apical section of the collateral smoothly up to the occluded section， but it was impossible to spin the Corsair to the occlusion due to a lack of backup support. The retrograde Corsair was intro-duced into a 5F Guidion. Using the telescopic technique with the Guidion tip positioned in the mid-RCA， it was possible to advance the Corsair 150 cm in the LAD close to the distal capof the occlusion . After several balloon inflations， antegrade unintentional reentry into the LAD true lumen was achieved when preparing for reverse CART using the knuckle technique with Sion Blue， similar to a kissing wire. After suc-cessful retrograde crossing of the occlusion and externaliza-tion of the RG3 wire， the NHancer RX dual lumen catheter was used in a rendez-vous technique with Corsair to safely secure the D2 branch using a Sion Blue wire. Two stents were suc-cessfully placed in the LAD with a patent D2 branch . Procedure safety characteristics can be found in Table 1.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Retrograde advancement of a microcatheter through septal/epicardial connectors and also through the CTO lesion itself can be challenging. However， once the retrograde microcath-eter has reached the antegrade guiding， wire externalization with a RG3 wire (Asahi@) is easily performed . Although the retrograde wire can be trapped with a balloon in the an-tegrade guiding or in the native coronary artery to provide support for crossing of the CTO with the microcatheter， these techniques are not always applicable； for example， when a 6F antegrade guiding is used， the presence of the microcatheter does not allow trapping of the wire into the guiding with an additional balloon alongside the microcatheter. Also， balloon trapping of the retrograde wire in the native coronary artery is not always possible for anatomical reasons (e.g.， ostial LAD occlusion). One of the often-used additional techniques is to maneuver the retrograde wire followed by the microcatheter(and later RG3 wire (Asahi@)) into an antegrade guide exten-sion (guide extension-assisted retrograde wiring and guideextension-assisted reverse CART) . In patients with poor access (6F) or single catheter use (ipsicollateral)， these tech-niques might fail. In case 1 and 3 we describe how a novel telescopic Corsair in Guidion technique facilitates passage of a microcatheter through collateral vessels. In case 2. we de-scribe how this telescopic Corsair in Guidion technique offered the necessary support to puncture a very hard ostial CTO. The internal diameter of the Guidion (1.42 mm) allows the Corsair(external diameter： 0.87 mm) to fit in perfectly， with smooth transition \n\n【15】Conclusions\n\n【16】During retrograde CTO procedures， the telescopic Corsair in5F Guidion may offer the support needed to end successfully when advancing microcatheters through septal/epicardial con-nectors or when crossing the distal CTO cap proves challenging.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Echinococcosis usually forms a monolocular cyst and causes space occupying effect， while alveolar echinococcosis often progresses into a polycystic mass that dilates into the adjacent liver parenchyma， with different clinical manifestations. In clin-ical practice， hepatic hydatid cyst and simple cyst are generally diagnosed clearly， but there are still misdiag-nosed cases.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 40-year-old female patient with no symptoms had a computed tomography and magnetic resonance imag ing examination that revealed multiple round-like shadows of varying sizes in her liver. Combined with the lab-oratory and imaging results， the diagnosis was considered as hepatic hemangioma and hepatic cyst. Therefore， we planned to perform ultrasound guided microwave ablation of hepatic hemangioma and laparoscopic fen-estration of hepatic cyst. Considering the possibility of hepatic hydatid cysts during the operation， partial hep-atectomy was performed.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】More attention should be paid to the differential diagnosis of cystic space occupying lesions in the liver. For the treatment of hepatic cyst， if suspected， must change the surgical strategy\n\n【6】MeSH Keywords： Diagnostic Errors·Echinococcosis， Hepatic·Liver Diseases， Alcoholic · Surgical TapeHepatic hydatid cysts are a cystic disease caused by echino coccus， which can even cause death in severe cases， it main-ly occurs in the liver (50% to 70%) and is relatively rare in the lungs and other parts . In hepatic hydatid cysts， the most common symptom is right epigastric pain (38.2%) and the least is jaundice (11.7%). The most common sign is a lump in the right upper quadrant (88.2%)， and the least is ascites(5.8%) . Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be performed for incidental findings of liver cysts with septate， calcified， irregular walls or subcysts. CT can identify small cysts larger than 1 cm in diameter and observe the internal structure of cysts， liver parenchyma and biliary tract. When used in combination with serology， CT has a high specificity and sensitivity (close to 96%). MRI is superior to CT in showing the internal structure of cysts and potential biliary tract involvement. Elevated eosinophils were observed in approximately 39% of patients on laboratory examination， and elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values suggest-ed hepatolysis syndrome in patients without underlying liv-er disease . Asymptomatic simple hepatic cyst should be closely followed up and puncture drainage is not recommend-ed. Symptomatic simple hepatic cysts should be treated with laparoscopic fenestration. Laparoscopic or open surgery is rec-ommended for complicated liver echinococcosis with multiple vesicles， asci， ruptured cysts， bleeding or secondary infection， and postoperative medication should be given .\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】A 40-year-old female patient was diagnosed with hemangio-ma in a local hospital before June 2019. She did not receive any treatment due to no symptoms. There are endemic re-gions with much higher incidence of hydatid cysts， such asnorth-western China. But the patient was not from this area and had no history of pastoral contact.\n\n【9】She had a follow-up CT re-examination in our hospital on July30， 2019 that demonstrated multiple round low-density shad-ows seen in the left lobe and the front segment of the right lobe， with blurred boundaries； the larger one was about 3.9x3.8 cm， which was diagnosed as multiple liver cysts . A re-examination of MRI on September 5，2019 showed that there were multiple round， long T1 signal and T2 signal， high STIR signal in the anterior upper segment of the right lobe and the lateral segment of the left lobe in the liver. The larger one was located in the segment of the right lobe， about 4.9x4.8×3.5cm. The lesion's margin of the right anterior upper segment and the left lateral segment of the liver was slightly enhanced at arterial phase， significantly enhanced at the substance phase and portal phase， while the remaining lesions were not sig-nificantly enhanced. It was diagnosed as multiple intrahepatic hemangiomas and multiple hepatic cysts . After ad-mission laboratory examination results are shown in Table 1. Combined with the laboratory and imaging results， the diag-nosis was considered as 1) hepatic hemangioma； 2) hepat-ic cyst. Therefore， we planned to perform ultrasound guided microwave ablation of hepatic hemangioma and laparoscopic fenestration of hepatic cyst on September 18， 2019.\n\n【10】During the operation， laparoscopic exploration revealed that there were 3 circle-like firm and rubbery masses at the low-er margin of the right lobe of the liver， which suggested the possibility of hepatic hydatid cyst . Due to the lim-ited space of laparoscopic operation and the unclear nature of liver mass， the patient's procedure was converted to open laparotomy for ultrasound guided microwave ablation of he-patic hemangioma， laparoscopic exploration and partial hep atectomy. The postoperative specimen was a thick-walled firm and rubbery cystic mass containing yellow viscous cystic fluid\n\n|  |  | Reference value  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| WBC  | 8.54  | 3.2-9.7×10/L  |\n| E0%  | 7.3  | 0.5-5%  |\n| EO#  | 0.62  | 0-0.45  |\n| RBC  | 4.68  | 3.5-5.5×1012/L  |\n| HGB  | 146  | 113-151 g/L  |\n| HBsAg  | 0.00  | <0.03  |\n| HCV  | 0.00  | <1.00  |\n| AST  | 27  | 15-46 U/L  |\n| ALT  | 25  | 11-66 U/L  |\n| ALB  | 45.5  | 35-50 g/L  |\n\n|  |  | Reference value  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| TBIL  | 13.39  | 3-22 umol/L  |\n| BC  | 2.30  | 0.0-5.0 umol/L  |\n| BU  | 11.09  | 0-19 umol/L  |\n| PT  | 10.2  | 9.8-12.1S  |\n| PTA  | 118.1  | 80-120%  |\n| INR  | 0.92  | 0.8-1.2  |\n\n【13】WBC -white blood cell； EO -eosinophils； RBC- red blood cell； HGB -hemoglobin； HBsAg-hepatitis B surface antigen； HCV- hepatitis C virus； AST -aspartate aminotransferase； ALT - alanine aminotransferase； ALB - albumin； TBIL -total bilirubin； BC - conjugated bilirubin； BU -unconjugated bilirubin； PT - prothrombin time； PTA - prothrombin time activity， INR-international normalized ratio.\n\n【14】. Postoperative pathology showed chronic granulo matous inflammation of the liver accompanied by coagulative necrosis and cystic changes， with a few scolex， which was con-sidered as hepatic hydatid cysts . The patient was discharged 5 days after surgery.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】A hydatid cyst is a single， fluid-filled spherical vesicle consist-ing of an inner cell layer (germinal layer) and an outer stratum corneum. The cyst expands gradually， causing granulomatous host reaction， followed by fibrous capsule wall development. With the passage of time，the internal division and the devel-opment of the daughter cysts changed the morphology of the monolocular cyst， which is typical of the early hydatid cyst. When the final host mistakenly eats the parasitic ovum， the life cycle of echinococcosis can start again， with the proto-scolex attaching to the intestinal mucosa， and developing to the adult stage within 30 to 80 days. Echinococcosis usuallyforms a monolocular cyst and causes space occupying effect， while alveolar echinococcosis often progresses into a polycys-tic mass that dilates into the adjacent liver parenchyma and resembles an aggressive malignancy .\n\n【17】The prevalence of hepatic cyst is 0.1% to 0.5%， and only less than 10% to 15% of patients will have symptoms that cause clinical attention， such as abdominal mass， abdominal pain(stretching the liver capsule)， and compression symptoms(pressing the biliary tract causes jaundice， pressing the portal vein causes portal hypertension， etc.).\n\n【18】Surgery is the main treatment， involves excising most of the cyst wall either by laparotomy or laparoscopy. Although lapa-roscopy is much less effective than the closed cyst resection， it has the advantage of reducing the difficulties of an eventu-al re-intervention， less trauma， and a lower incidence of com-plications. For patients with symptomatic simple hepatic cysts smaller than 500 cc in volume by using puncture， aspiration， injection， and re-aspiration (PAIR) technique is a safe and ef-fective procedure with high success rate . But the cost of such procedures cannot be supported by all health systems.\n\n【19】Different types of hepatic hydatid cysts may sometimes be very similar to hepatic cyst， mainly depending on the stage of devel-opment of hepatic hydatid cyst， especially in the early stage， a hepatic hydatid cyst is usually manifested as full-fluid cyst， simple imaging is difficult to distinguish from simple hepat-ic cyst . This is the key to making early diagnosis difficult.\n\n【20】The differential diagnosis between hepatic hydatid cyst and simple hepatic cyst mainly includes the following points： 1) serology with eosinophil in about 39% of patients with he-patic hydatid have eosinophil elevation . Other serologicalindicators such as EgAg5， EgAgBs， endophilin B1， and rEgAgB2can be used as diagnostic indicators of hepatic hydatid cyst， but their clinical applicability still needs further study . However， it is important to note that a single serological indi-cator cannot determine the diagnosis of hepatic hydatid cyst.2) The calcification degree of cyst is not a reliable index to evaluate the activity of hepatic hydatid. Immunological tests， especially lgG4 and IgE， may be useful in assessing the activi-ty of hepatic hydatid because they detect a higher proportion and titer during the activity phase . 3) Biochemical analy-sis includes the concentration of glucose， Ca+ and uric acid in hepatic hydatid cyst fluid is significantly higher than that of simple hepatic cyst . 4) Imaging， as far as current stud-ies are concerned， the imaging features of hepatic hydatid cyst are clearly defined thick-walled cystic lesions. The difference in CT density can be used as one of the differential diagnos-tic indicators of hepatic hydatid cyst and simple hepatic cyst. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of diffusion weight-ed imaging (DWI) in MRl is significant for the differential di-agnosis of hepatic hydatid cyst and simple hepatic cyst， and b=1000 s/mm² may be a significant node .\n\n【21】Surgery is the main method for the treatment of complicat-ed hepatic hydatid cyst (including greater than 5 cm in diam-eter， polycystic vesicles，infection， close relationship with bil-iary tract and adjacent organs， etc.).\n\n【22】Some studies have reported that the recurrence rate of he-patic hydatid after primary surgery is 6% to 30%， and there is no significant difference in postoperative complications be-tween laparoscopic surgery and open surgery . However， open surgery is still the main surgical treatment at present， and more and more studies hope to achieve therapeutic pur-poses with more minimally invasive methods， such as perfora tor-grinder-aspirator-apparatus (PGAA) and nanosecond pulsed electric field (nsPEF). However， laparoscopic surgery also has some defects， such as difficulty in exposing partial cysts and increased risk of fluid leakage. Recurrent hepatic hydatid cyst， due to the large size of the hydatid cyst， adhered to the site of previous treatment， have a close relationship with the liv-er blood vessels and other problems； hepatectomy is still themain treatment method. In addition， percutaneous aspiration is a safe treatment for patients who are not suitable for sur-gical treatment and who have long-term use of medications for management and financial difficulties .\n\n【23】Postoperative drug therapy is important for hepatic hydatid. Albendazole is the most effective first-line drug for the treat-ment of hepatic hydatid cyst. How to improve drug release performance is a breakthrough point to improve drug treat-ment effect.\n\n【24】Conclusions\n\n【25】More attention should be paid to the differential diagnosis of cystic space occupying lesions in the liver. In this case， preop-erative ultrasound， CT， and MR did not indicate hepatic hydatid cyst， and the elevated eosinophils in the blood routine of the patient did not attract the attention of clinicians， resulting in preoperative misdiagnosis as simple hepatic cyst. Due to the timely change of treatment methods after intraoperative lapa-roscopic exploration， the adverse clinical results caused by flu-id leakage， which may be caused by puncture and other oper-ations， were avoided. For cystic space occupying lesions with complicated liver conditions， multiple examination methods in-cluding MRI， serology and immunoassay should be combined to improve the diagnostic rate. In this case， it was because of the complicated situation of cystic lesions in the lower margin of the right liver lobe that laparoscopic exploration was decid-ed， instead of direct puncture and drainage guided by ultra-sound to deal with cystic lesions， so as to avoid the possibil-ity of strong allergic reaction caused by the leakage of cystic fluid. In patients with cystic liver disease， it is still a challenge for surgeons to make a clear diagnosis and adopt appropriate treatment. This case can provide some references for the fu-ture treatment of cystic liver lesions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

On clinical examination and imaging (US -ultrasonography， CT - computed tomography， MRI - magnetic resonance imaging) he was misdiagnosed as retinal detachment， endophthalmitis， optic nerve glioma and multiple meningiomas. The boy died because of extensive metastases to central nervous system.

It accounts for 3% of all malignant tumors in childhood at all. It is usually diagnosed within the first few years of life. Most cases(60%) are nonhereditary (sporadic) and unilateral. The remaining 40% of germinal mutations is inherited and often bilateral. There are 3 growth patterns of RBS. It can grow subretinally (exophytic) with secondary retinal detachment， second： into the vitreous (endophytic) producing widespread seeding in the eye， and -rarely- occurs as a diffused infiltrating mass that grows along the retina and into the vitreous， looking much like a posterior uveitis. The most common presenting signs of RBS are leukocoria (a white reflex within the pupil)and strabismus (due to poor vision). RBS can also present with findings that mimic other ophthalmic disorders， such as vitreous hemorrhage， retinal detachment， hy-phema， hypopion， vitreous opacities， iris heterochromia(due to rubeosis iridis)， inflammation (due to tumor necrosis， causing uveitis and lid swelling， which may mimic orbital cellulitis)， glaucoma. Retinoblastoma not treated， usually leads to death； combining modern therapeutic methods over 95% survival rate can be achieved. Treatment depends on staging of neoplasm and includes chemotherapy， cryotherapy， thermoche-motherapy， radiotherapy， enucleation .\n\n【8】CASE REPORT\n\n【9】3-years-old boy was sent to a hospital diagnosed with cataract. He was noted by his parents to have leukoco-ria for about a month. On ophthalmologic examination his right eye showed no abnormalities. The left eye was slightly engorged， the cornea was clear， anterior cham-ber free and normally deep， iris not irritated. There was a yellowish conglomerate in pupil’s area which was making it impossible to evaluate the eye fundus.\n\n【10】Ultrasonography B-scan showed retrolental inflam-matory exudate filling the eye， with no evidence of calcifications.\n\n【11】Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits done with the intra venous contrast administration revealed retinal haemorrhagic detachment with no pathological enhances， that seemed to exclude neo-plastic process.\n\n【12】Because clinical view was not obvious， the boy was sent to a higher specialized facility.\n\n【13】The diagnosis of endophthalmitis in left eye was es-tablished. Unfortunately， the boy's parents didn’t give consent for hospitalization and took him home.\n\n【14】They came back to a hospital with the child after6 months because of increasing exophthalmitis and pain of his left eye . The right eye still showed no abnormalities. The left eye was deeply irritated， cornea was blurred. There was no view on iris details and no view at the fundus . Pupil’s reaction on light was diminished， intraocular pressure -very high. CT (computed tomography) imaging showed tumor mass in the anterior cranial fossa on the left from the sella turcica and along the small wing of the sphenoid bone， through the optic nerve canal to the left orbit and along the wall of the left eyeball. It was diagnosed by consultating neuro-surgeon as multiple gliomas. MR imaging (T1- and T2-weighted images) revealed suspicion of eyeball tumor penetrating into the cranium along the optic nerve. Three more than two centimeter large tumor masses (first： surrounding the left optic nerve in the orbit， second： along intracranial part of the left optic nerve and third： in the left cerebellopontine angle) were described .\n\n【15】Boy's left eye was enucleated； histological examination result was： retinoblastoma non differantiatum.\n\n【16】The child was planned to be treated in oncological department， but the day before he was supposed to be transferred， he presented meningismus， vomiting and stiffening of the body. He lost consciousness and died during the 9ih day after the surgery.\n\n【17】DISCUSSION\n\n【18】In many cases even direct ophthalmoscopy of the eye fundus is a sufficient method for correct diagnosis， however the stereoscopic ophthalmoscopy allows for better evaluation. Ultrasonography and CT scanning usually help to visualize characteristic calcifications and allows for the measurement of the tumor mass. CT and MR imaging of head and orbits enable the evaluation of the optic nerve and orbit infiltration and localization of metastases .\n\n【19】Differential diagnosis includes： Coats’disease， per-sistent hyperplastic primary vitreous， toxocariasis， retinopathy of prematurity . In many cases initially diagnosed as retinoblastoma， finally turned out to be an inflammation. Unfortunately， as it was shown in our case， there are also cases of tumors thought to be for example an inflammation as the primary suspi-cion. Butros et al. reported that 21% of parents who noticed in their children such signs as leukocoria or strabismus， were reassured by physician of diagnosis different from retinoblastoma .\n\n【20】Diffused form of RBS is especially difficult to di-agnose， as it was shown in this report. Hautz in his work  underlines special diagnostic difficulties in this type of RBS. Aerts et al. also reported that“in-vasive， diffused forms of retinoblastoma， usually not calcified， are very difficult to diagnose due to their atypical and radiological features”.\n\n【21】Pseudohypopyon (aggregates of tumor cells in anterior chamber) and tumor cells in vitreous can be misdiag-nosed as ocular inflammation what in effect can delay the prompt therapy. In a result therapy of tumor has to be more aggressive and radical.\n\n【22】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【23】Despite the development of modern imaging tech-niques retinoblastoma can still be a difficult diag-nostic problem.\n\n【24】When the diagnosis is not obvious， it is important to remember， that some types of low differentiated tu-mors don't present typical calcifications on US， MRI and CT images even in a large tumor mass.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "e02d1ede-092b-4fa8-8713-71333f70d309", "title": null, "text": "【0】Background：\n\n【1】We report on a series of six cases presenting with splenic trauma； managed appropriately in senior hands with splenic preserving surgical techniques. The radiological grading of injury can be correlated as a predictor of the probability of surgery versus conservative management. Both the radiological grading and grading made at laparotomy is further discussed as well as the benefits of splenic preservation， the relevant anatomy and the operative techniques involved.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】Our series of cases underwent laparotomy upon developing haemodynamic instability. The operative technique chosen correlates appropriately with the grade of injury found at laparotomy， radiological grading and the seniority of operating surgeon.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】In experienced hands and appropriate circumstances splenic preserving surgery is an effective surgical option in the management of splenic trauma.\n\n【6】Key words： partial splenectomy· splenic repair · abdominal trauma\n\n【7】The spleen is the most common intra-abdominal organ involved in blunt trauma followed by the liver . The management of splenic trauma has changed from immediate operative management in all cases to non-operative management wherever possible .\n\n【8】The change in management has been influenced by an appreciation of how the spleen functions. The spleen acts as a lymphoid filter for the bloodstream promoting opsonisation and phagocytosis of bac-teria and infected cells. Splenectomy permanently increases disease susceptibility particularly from virulent polysaccharide encapsulated organisms such as pneumococcus， haemophilus influenzae type B and meningococcus. Life-threatening post splenectomy infections can occur in about 0.5% of trauma patients and up to 20% patients with haematological abnor-malities. The greatest risk is in the first two years of asplenism， but some risk persists throughout life and mortality from these infections can be as high as 80%. The vascular complications of thrombocytosis are also recognized post splenectomy. It is for these reasons that a trend away from splenectomy and to-wards partial splenectomy or splenic conservation has emerged.\n\n【9】Here we have looked at the outcomes of 6 consecu-tive trauma patients presenting with splenic trau-ma， haemodynamic instability and who underwent laparotomy with consultant involvement (NDK).\n\n【10】Whilst there are several scoring systems for the grad-ing of traumatic injury to the spleen we have used the classification proposed by the Organ Scaling Committee of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST)，  .\n\n【11】Of our series of six cases  based over seven years splenic injury was confirmed by ultrasound in 3of our cases and by computerised tomography (CT) in the 3 remaining cases. One case had a grade II injury and underwent diathermy for a small serosal tear； three cases with a grade III injury underwent a partial splenectomy and the remaining cases， one with a grade IV  and one with a grade V injury underwent a total splenectomy.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n\n【13】The syndrome of overwhelming post-splenectomy sepsis has provided the impetus for splenic preser-vation in the trauma setting and this involves either non-operative or operative management. The most important clinical decision lies in the recognition of those who need an operation. The remaining indica-tions for surgery are： (i) penetrating injuries； (ii) when there is clinical or radiological suspicion of another intra-abdominal injury； (iii) failure of non-operative management (ongoing transfusion requirement taken as greater than 2 units blood)； or (iv) when there is an associated significant head injury. The primary goalsof successful operative management are the cessation of active haemorrhage and to achieve a repair， which allows as much organ preservation as possible.\n\n| Grade  | Injury description\"  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Haematoma  | Subcapsular， non-expanding， <10% surface area  |\n| Laceration  | Lapsular tear， non-bleeding， <1 cm parenchymal depth  |\n| Haematoma  | Subcapsular， non-expanding， 10-50% surface area； intra-parenchymal non-expanding <2 cm in diameter  |\n| Laceration  | Capsular tear， active bleeding， 1-3 cm parenchymal depth that does not involve a trabecular vessel  |\n| Haematoma  | Subcapsular， > 50% surface area or expanding； ruptured subcapsular haematoma with active bleeding， intra-parenchymal  |\n|  | haematoma > 2 cm or expanding  |\n| Laceration  | \\> 3 cm parenchymal depth or involving trabecular vessels  |\n| Haematoma  | Ruptured intra-parenchymal haematoma with active bleeding  |\n| Laceration  | Laceration involving segmental or hilar vessels producing major devascularisation (> 25% of spleen)  |\n| V  |  |\n| Laceration  | Completely shattered spleen  |\n| Vascular  | Hilar vascular injury that devascularises spleen  |\n| Advance one grade for multiple injuries to the same organ.  |  |\n\n【15】\" Based on most accurate assessment at post mortem， laparotomy or radiological studies.\n\n| La5e5  | Grade  | Degree  | CTscore  | Operation (partial/total)  | Grade of first surgeon  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 31y.0.6  | V  | 4  | N/A  | Total (shattered spleen and subcapsular haematoma)  | Consultant  |\n| 24y.o.  | Ⅲ  | 3  | N/A  | Partial (upper pole ruptured)  | Consultant  |\n| 59y.o.3  | V  | 4  | 2  | lotal  | Senior Registrar  |\n| 18y.0.6  |  | 3  | 5  | Partial (lower pole ruptured)  | Consu tant  |\n| 7y.0.3  |  | 3  | N/A  | Partial (lower pole ruptured)  | Consultant  |\n| 52y.0.6  |  | 0  | 0  | Serosal splenic capsule tear - diathermied  | Consultant  |\n\n【17】\\* The grading and degree of splenic injuries for our cases is primarily based on operative findings.\n\n【18】Table 3.

The CT scoring system developed by Resciniti et al.， 1988 (table 3)， propose that a score of less than 2.5 correlates with a 100% chance of suc-cessful non-operative management. A score greater2-Superior splenic artery； 3 - Inferior splenic artery；\n\n【21】4 - Central segmental artery； 5-Superior polar artery；\n\n【22】6 -Inferior polar artery； 7 - Left gastro-epiploic artery.\n\n【23】than or equal to 2.5 is correlated with a 46% likelihood of suecessful non-operative management.\n\n【24】The various techniques of splenic repair include the use of topical haemostatic agents； splenorrhaphy in-cluding direct suture or wrapping the spleen in absorb able mesh； partial splenectomy； arterial ligation and autotransplantation， which involves the transplant of splenic fragments in an omental pouch. Partial sple-nectomy is an effective approach for achieving haemo-stasis and preserving organ function and the segmental blood supply of the spleen allows for this. Studies have confirmed that reticuloendothelial function is better preserved after partial splenectomy and splenic repair than after splenic autotransplantation provided that at least 25% of splenic tissue is preserved .\n\n【25】Splenic salvage surgery is possible because of the segmental blood supply of the spleen. Previous studies based on anatomical dissection and contrast radiology identify the existence of 3-7 splenic segments with a mean of 4.3， separated by avascular planes. Each seg-ment has its own arterial supply and venous drainage. The splenic artery derived from the coeliac axis divides into two branches separating the spleen into two sections； in the majority of cases these further divide into segmental arteries supplying the central segments of the spleen. The polar segments are sup-plied by segmental vessels of variable origin and size. Partial-splenectomy may be performed after complete mobilization of the spleen by division of the lieno-renal ligament followed by ligation of the relevant branch of the splenic artery. Following devascularisation of the appropriate part of the spleen transection may be performed by diathermy pencil and any troublesome bleeding points under-run with 5‘0’prolene vascular sutures. Fibrin glue (Quixil， Johnson and Johnson) helps seal the raw surface.\n\n【26】Other series have suggested that some patients with grade I or II injuries can be managed non-operatively， however nearly all grade V injuries require a totalsplenectomy. It is recommended that Grade III and IV patients be treated by either splenic repair  (sutur-ing， coagulation， fibrin sealing， splenorrhaphy using an absorbable compressive mesh or a combination of treatments)， or occasionally partial splenectomy for haemostasis. We have found that partial splenectomy is an extremely effective procedure for deep injuries of one pole or one half of the spleen.\n\n【27】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【28】We report on six consecutive patients with splenic trauma and haemodynamic instability who underwent surgery with senior involvement. In accordance with the grade of injury one patient had a splenic repair， three underwent partial splenectomy and two patients had a total splenectomy. The advantage of partial splenectomy is in the retention of some reticulo-en-dothelial function thus avoiding the need for life-long antibiotic and vaccine cover. In experienced hands and appropriate circumstances partial splenectomy is an effective surgical option in the management of splenic trauma. The benefits of such surgery out weigh the possible complications of re-bleeding and thrombosis of the residual splenic tissue.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It develops as a result of leakage from a urinoma， a perirenal collection of urine， from the retroperitoneal space to the pleura . A urinoma is usually caused by aniatrogenic injury or a urinary obstruction that deve-lops after an invasive procedure such as percutaneous intervention or extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy(ESWL) . In most reported cases， the diagnosis of urinothorax was made retrospectively， depending on the presence of pleural effusion with obstructive uropathy and resolution of the effusion after removal of the obstruction. The pleural fluid-serum creatinine ratio and other biochemical parameters have been used for diagnosis in only a few cases .\n\n【8】We report a patient with urinothorax secondary to bilateral nephrolithiasis. The biochemical data regar-ding the pleural effusion are also presented.\n\n【9】CASE REPORT\n\n【10】A 37-year-old woman， a nonsmoker， was admitted to our emergency department with the complaints of dyspnea and left-sided pleuritic pain. She had no systemic disease but had undergone left-sided pyelolithotomy twice and right-sided pyelolithotomy once. Her physical examination was normal except for diminished breath sounds and dullness on per-cussion of the left lung base. Results of a complete blood count and biochemical analysis of blood were normal. A posteroanterior chest radiograph revealed坐a moderate left-sided pleural effusion and diagnostic thoracentesis was performed. Laboratory analyses of the pleural fluid yielded the following findings： white blood cell count， 1470/mm3 (73%lymphocytes)；pH，7.12； glucose， 2 mg/dL (serum value， 94 mg/dL)； total protein， 0.12 g/dL (serum value， 6.9 g/dL)； albumin，0.1 g/dL (serum value， 3.3 g/dL)； lactate dehydroge-nase (LDH) 436 U/L (serum value， 161 U/L)； and adenosine deaminase， 37 U/L. As the patient had a pleural effusion and history of nephrolithiasis， urino-thorax was suspected and creatinine level of pleural fluid was also analyzed. Pleural fluid-serum creatinine ratio was found to be 34.8 (pleural fluid value， 40.4mg/dL； serum value， 1.16 mg/dL).Microbiologic and cyt\n\n【11】Cyt\n\n【12】ologic examination of the pleural fluid revealed no pathology.\n\n【13】Computed tomography of thorax and abdomen reve-aled prominent pleural effusion in the left hemithorax and atelectasis in the left lower lobe ， bilateral nephrolithiasis and hydronephrosis， free perisplenic fluid  and localized hypoden-se fluid collection resembling urinoma . Abdominal radiography and intravenous pyelography showed that both kidneys were dilated and defor-med， and nephrolithiasis was observed in the upper， middle， and lower calyces of the right kidney and in the middle and lower calyces of the left kidney. The ureteropelvic junction was narrower than normal.\n\n【14】A renal perfusion scan using mercaptoacetyltriglyci-ne (MAG-3)-labeled Tc-99m demonstrated urinary extravasation from the upper pole of the left kidney to the pleural space .\n\n【15】Bilateral percutaneous nephrolithotomy and anteg-rade endopyelolithotomy for ureteropelvic stenosis were performed at the same time. A chest radiograph on the first postoperative day showed that the pleural effusion had begun to resolve. During the control visit10 days after the operation， no pleural effusion was observed. Urinary extravasation to pleura was seen to disappear in the control dynamic renal scinthigraphy1 month after the operation . Lithotomy and correction of the stenosis enabled resolution of the effusion in our patient， and no other treatment was required.\n\n【16】The diagnosis of urinothorax in our patient was based on the presence of a urinoma， a pleural fluid-serum creatinine ratio of 34.8， low pH and low glucose levels， confirmed urine extravasation into the pleural space(as shown on dynamic renal scintigraphy using MAG-3 labeled Tc-99m)， and resolution of the pleural fluid after removal of the urinary obstruction.\n\n【17】The patient was monitored for 18 months， during which time the effusion did not recur.\n\n【18】DISCUSSION\n\n【19】Urinothorax， which is collection of urine in the pleural space， was first described by Corriere and colleagues in 1968 . In the case of urinothorax， it is thought that urine reaches the pleura from the ret-roperitoneal region via diaphragmatic lymphatics or through an anatomic defect in the diaphragm . Urinary obstruction， percutaneous renal and endos-copic ureteral interventions， urinary inflammatoryand malignant diseases， blunt renal trauma， ESWL， and posterior urethral valve are among the repor-ted causes of urinothorax . In most cases， diagnosis is established by the presence of pleural effusion and obstructive uropathy and disappearan-ce of the effusion after removal of the obstruction. Unilateral renal or ureteral obstruction in the absence of trauma has been reported not to cause urinothorax if function of the other kidney is nor-mal. Nephrolithiasis is a rare cause of urinothorax. Although the mechanism remains unclear， chronic obstruction caused by bilateral nephrolithiasis or acute obstruction that results from nephrolithiasis and hydronephrosis may be the cause in these ca-ses . We suggest that the cause of urinothorax in our patient was an obstruction that resulted from bilateral nephrolithiasis and ureteropelvic stenosis. After a short period of time postoperatively pleural effusion has been resolved in our patient， and no other treatment was required (as has been reported in other cases ).\n\n【20】Pleural fluid is transudative in the case of urinotho-rax； its appearance and odor resemble those of urine. pH and glucose levels are low， and the pleural fluid-serum creatinine ratio is > 1. It has been reported that glucose levels decrease as the creatinine ratio increases . High levels of LDH in the pleural fluid frequently have been reported in patients with urinothorax， since underlying urinary disease can cause an increase in enzyme activity. This may in turn cause the misclassification of the pleural fluid as an exudate. For this reason， alternative parame ters should be used to differentiate exudates from transudates when urinothorax is suspected . Biochemical analysis of the pleural fluid in our case revealed that the pH value， glucose level， and protein level were very low， and the LDH level and pleural fluid-serum creatinine ratio were high.\n\n【21】We suggest that urinothorax be suspected in patients with nephrolithiasis and pleural effusion. Diagnostic thoracentesis is essential in early identification of these cases by determination of pH and levels of glucose， protein， LDH， and creatinine.

{"seq_id": "9c186853-e44e-4adb-9ed3-95e8de37850c", "title": null, "text": "【0】Background： Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) is a relatively rare adverse effect of metformin therapy. It usual-ly occurs in patients with metformin overdose or in those with underlying acute and/or chronic conditions re-sulting in impaired lactate metabolism. Among these， patients with acute kidney injury， heart failure， sepsis， and cirrhosis are the most vulnerable to MALA， even in the setting of appropriate therapy. The most common symptoms of MALA include nausea， vomiting， diarrhea，encephalopathy， hypothermia， respiratory failure， and hypotension. Blindness is a dramatic symptom that has been rarely reported with MALA.\n\n【1】Case Report：\n\n【2】We report a case of 78-year-old woman with history of type 2 diabetes mellitus with nephropathy for which she was treated with metformin and insulin. She developed nausea， non-bloody emesis， and watery diarrhea， which led to dehydration， anion gap metabolic acidosis due to hyperlactatemia， and acute kidney injury (AKI). She was hospitalized for i.v. hydration and further management when she suddenly developed blindness. The diagnostic work-up ruled out central causes and her symptoms resolved briefly after continuous renal replace-ment therapy (CRRT) was initiated， confirming the diagnosis of MALA.\n\n【3】Conclusions： By reporting this case， we wish to increase awareness about MALA symptoms， its diagnosis， and the impor-tance of early recognition and initiation of treatment among clinicians involved in the care of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who take metformin for diabetes mellitus. Although rare， this metformin adverse effect can present dramatically and can be distressing for both patient and treating team.\n\n【4】Keywords： Acidosis， Lactic· Blindness· Dialysis·Metformin\n\n【5】Metformin is a biguanide used as a first-line medication to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. It has multiple advantages， in-cluding low cost， weight neutrality， low risk for hypoglycemia， and anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective effects. It is a well-tolerated medication with a good safety profile . Historically， metformin was not recommended for use in patients with an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m². In 2016， the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended the use of metformin even in patients with eGFR of 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m² . This re-sulted in the addition of more than one million patients with CKD who are now on therapy with metformin. This change has likely contributed to an increase in cases of metformin-asso-ciated adverse effects . The most common adverse effects from metformin are gastrointestinal， including nausea， diar-rhea， and flatulence. Other reported adverse effects are cya-nocobalamin deficiency， asthenia， headache， and hepatitis . MALA occurs mostly in patients with underlying co-morbidities resulting in impaired metformin and lactic acid metabolism. The incidence of MALA is estimated to be 1-10 per 100 000 ， and is usually reported in patients with AKI who have impaired metformin clearance . MALA can be life threatening. Its mor-tality historically has been reported to be as high as 50%. However， newer reports suggest a much lower， but still un-acceptably high， mortality rate of 17.2%. Transient blind-ness has been rarely reported as a symptom of MALA .\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】A 78-year-old woman presented to the emergency room com-plaining of 2 weeks of progressively worsening non-bloody di-arrhea with approximately 5 bowel movements per day. Three days prior to presentation，she developed left lower-quadrant dull abdominal pain accompanied by nausea and non-bloody vomiting. She did not have fever， headache， cough， shortness of breath，jaw claudication， joint pain， or any visual disturbances. She lived in Wisconsin， had not travelled outside of the state recently， and reported no sick contacts. She was immunized against COVID-19 with the Moderna mRNA vaccine 4 months before presentation. Her past medical history was significant for poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (A1C 8.4%)，hy-pertension， CKD 3b A2， depression， hypertriglyceridemia， and anemia with CKD. Her surgical history included bilateral cata-ract surgery 10 years prior. She was compliant with her med-ications up until the day prior to admission， when she could not take them due to nausea and vomiting. These included：aspirin 81 mg daily， atorvastatin 40 mg daily， famotidine 20mg twice daily as needed for heartburn， glargine insulin 18units subcutaneous at bedtime，aspart insulin 20 units subcu-taneous 3 times daily before meals， metformin 1000 mg twice daily， metoprolol tartrate 25 mg twice daily， losartan 100 mgdaily， torsemide 20 mg daily， and sertraline 150 mg daily. She denied recent medication changes and she had been taking metformin since 2005. She was a former smoker and denied a history of alcohol or illicit drug use. The family history was negative for cerebrovascular disease or vasculitides.\n\n【8】Initial vital signs showed temperature of 36.3℃， blood pres-sure 165/67 mmHg， heart rate 104 beats per minute， and re-spiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation was normal on ambient air. A physical exam showed an alert， pale woman in no distress. Her pupils were round， equal 2-3 mm， and reactive to light and accommodation. Mucous membranes were dry. Heart sounds were regular with tachycardia，and no murmurs or rubs. Lungs were clear to auscultation. An abdom-inal exam was significant for mild tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant， with no guarding or rebound tender-ness. Her neurological exam was normal.\n\n【9】The initial laboratory work-up showed leukocytosis 10.2x10°/L with neutrophilia and lymphopenia， hemoglobin 10.6 g/dL， mild thrombocytosis 438×10/L， lactate 6.4 mmol/L， sodi-um 135 mmol/L， hypochloremia 86 mmol/L， hyperkalemia6.2 mmol/L， anion gap elevated metabolic acidosis with bi-carbonate 6 mmol/L， anion gap 43， no osmolar gap， glucose269 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen 83 mg/dL， creatinine 8.47 mg/dL(baseline creatinine 1.2-1.4 mg/dL)， normal liver transaminas-es and total bilirubin， creatine kinase 110 U/L， venous blood gas pH <6.80， pCO2 17 mmHg， and beta-hydroxybutyrate 1.8mmol/L (ref range 0.0-0.5 mmol/L)， and the SARS CoV-2 poly-merase chain reaction (PCR) test negative. Urinalysis showed no signs of infection， but was positive for glucose 500 mg/dL and ketones 80 mg/dL. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis without intravenous (i.v.) contrast showed extensive colonic diverticula with some inflammatory change in the fat around the descending colon， which could represent mild diverticulitis. There was no free air or abscess collection.\n\n【10】We administered i.v. ceftriaxone and Flagyl， 2 L NaCl 0.9% fluid bolus， 300 mEq bicarbonate bolus， and bicarbonate drip (150mEg of bicarbonate in 1 L free water at 250 cc/h). A repeat lac-tate showed an increase to 9.6 mmol/L. New imaging of the abdomen and pelvis with i.v. contrast ruled out the possibili-ty of acute mesenteric ischemia. The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and an insu lin drip was initiated with addition of a 2-L NaCl 0.9% fluid bolus. Three hours after the initial presentation， the patient developed confusion， lethar-gy， hypothermia (32.2℃)， and sudden painless bilateral vision loss described as “floating blue clouds.\" Her blood pressure and heart rate remained stable. A repeat detailed physical exam showed pupils were equal at 3-4 mm with no light pu-pillary reaction， and absent blink to threat. The remaining neu-rological exam results were normal. A repeat abdominal exam showed no change.\n\n【11】A CT head was negative for acute abnormalities. Emergent oph-thalmology evaluation revealed preserved extraocular motility， no evidence of retinopathy， macular edema， acute glaucoma， or embolic phenomena， and confirmed no pupillary reaction to light and absent blink to threat. Given her risk factors for cerebrovascular disease， cortical blindness was considered. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed no acute abnormalities， which ruled out acute stroke. Repeated blood work 7 h after initial presentation showed worsening lactic acid of 14.2 mmol/L， sodium 138 mmol/L， hypochlore-mia 92 mmol/L， hyperkalemia 6.0， bicarbonate <5， anion gap unable to calculate， and glucose 264. A new venous blood gas analysis 9 h after presentation showed pH 6.87 and pCO2 29mmHg， along with worsening lactic acid of 16.1 . Due to persistent metabolic disturbances and development of new neurologic deficit， MALA with vision loss was suspected. The patient was initiated on emergent CRRT. She developed hypo-tension at that point and norepinephrine infusion was initi-ated. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed preserved left ventricular ejection fraction of 64% without segmental wall motion abnormalities， and no evident intracardiac mass or thrombus. This actively ruled out a cardiogenic etiology of shock. Volatile serum screen revealed high acetone at 18 mg/dL and was negative for methanol， ethanol， and isopropanol.\n\n【12】Two hours after CRRT initiation， metabolic acidosis and vision started to improve， and hours later her vision and mental sta-tus returned to her baseline. Hypothermia gradually resolved. Bicarbonate infusion was discontinued. Lactic acid normalized.\n\n【13】Insulin drip was transitioned to subcutaneous insulin. She was weaned off norepinephrine within 7 h. An infectious dis-eases work-up (blood and urine cultures) remained negative. Abdominal exam remained benign， and no recurrence of di-arrhea was noted. Forty-eight hours after initial presentation， empiric antibiotics were discontinued as sepsis was deemed unlikely. Dialysis was discontinued after 18 h. Creatinine im-proved to 2.93 mg/dL and the hyperkalemia resolved. She was discharged home in stable condition with an adjusted insulin regimen and indefinite discontinuation of metformin.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Pyruvate is produced from glucose during glycolysis， and sub-sequently enters the Krebs cycle if oxygen is available to the cells. Under anaerobic conditions， pyruvate is unable to en-ter mitochondria and is reduced to lactate by lactate dehy-drogenase . Lactate is metabolized by the liver (around70%)， while 30% is excreted by the kidneys. Hence， diseases that affect the liver and kidneys， mainly cirrhosis and acute renal failure， will lead to lactate accumulation and hyperlac-tatemia. There are 2 distinct types of hyperlactatemia： type A and type B. Type A occurs in the setting of tissue hypoperfu-sion such as severe sepsis， trauma， cardiogenic shock，and/or seizure. Type B hyperlactatemia is independent of tissue oxy-genation and most commonly is caused by medications that interfere with lactate metabolism . While both types can be associated with hemodynamic instability and hypotension，it is important to note that hypotension is the cause of type A hyperlactatemia， while it is a consequence of type B .\n\n【16】Type B hyperlactatemia can be caused by many medications. For example， use of beta 2 agonist can increase lactic acid in some patients due to increased pyruvate production . Propylene glycol is metabolized to lactate， and it was described as a cause of lactic acidosis in patients who were treated with lorazepam infusion (for alcohol withdrawal)， since 80% of volume in lo-razepam infusion is propylene glycol . Furthermore，linezol-id can cause hyperlactatemia B due to inhibition of mitochon-drial protein synthesis， which is similar to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors used for treatment of patients infect-ed with human immunodeficiency virus. Propofol can cause hyperlactatemia as part of propofol-related infusion syndrome(constellation of hyperlactatemia， rhabdomyolysis， renal fail-ure， hepatomegaly， and hyperlipidemia) due to inhibition of the electron transport chain .\n\n【17】There are several theories to explain development of MALA. Glucose conversion to lactate in the splanchnic bed of the small intestine can be increased by metformin . The MALA mechanism also involves metformin's mechanism of action. which is inhibition of gluconeogenesis via inhibition of mito-chondrial respiratory chain complex 1. During gluconeogen-esis， lactate is transformed into glucose. When this is inhib-ited， lactate accumulates， leading to hyperlactatemia . However， it is rare to have significant hyperlactatemia with a therapeutic metformin concentration and in patients with nor-mal liver function. Usually，another factor needs to be present for significant hyperlactatemia to develop， such as renal fail-ure (impaired metformin excretion) or liver failure (impaired metformin metabolism) or significant tissue hypoperfusion (se-vere sepsis， cardiogenic shock)， which lead to increased lactate production as a result of anaerobic metabolism .\n\n【18】Careful review of medications that our patient was taking did not reveal another potential culprit or significant interaction that could have led to an increased metformin concentration. We hypothesize that her initial diarrhea was an adverse ef-fect of metformin or it was a self-limiting viral gastrointestinal infection. Regardless of the etiology of the diarrhea， it led to dehydration. This， coupled with her taking losartan and torse-mide， led to AKl， which led to metformin accumulation and development of MALA. Symptoms that developed later， just before admission and shortly afterwards (nausea， vomiting， encephalopathy， hypotension， and blindness)， were attribut-ed to MALA. We ruled out a stroke with a negative CT and MRI brain imaging， cardiogenic shock was ruled out by normal TTE findings， and infection was ruled out by negative imaging and cultures. Monocular blindness， unlike bilateral blindness， as in our case， is the most common presentation of transient isch-emic attack associated with transient visual symptoms .\n\n【19】Blindness in our patient was reversed by dialysis， which sup-ported the diagnosis of MALA. MALA mimicking sepsis is an important differential diagnosis to exclude， as treatment for these 2 conditions is significantly different.\n\n【20】Blindness in patients who developed MALA has rarely been re-ported. A search of the PubMed database using the key words“transient vision loss” and “acidosis” and\"metformin-associat-ed lactic acidosis\" yielded only 5 cases . The clinical fea-tures of these patients are presented in Table 1. Two of these case reports may have been of the same patient based on in-formation obtained from case report . In all of these cases， patients were treated with di-alysis， and vision loss was transient and reversible following correction of acidosis. However， the patient in the case report described by leon et al recovered vision even before hemodial-ysis was initiated， after he was started on bicarbonate infusion.\n\n【21】Due to the rarity of this manifestation of MALA， human stud-ies are impossible to conduct to better understand its patho-physiology. However， some animal models suggest that retinal horizontal cells are particularly sensitive to low pH. During the state of acidemia， these cells might interrupt transmission of signals to the visual neurons， with consequent blindness .\n\n【22】Episodes of blindness have been reported in other types of ac-idosis， such as ketoacidosis or alcohol-related acidosis . Interestingly， it has not been described in patients with lactic acidosis from severe sepsis， so another factor (eg， metformin metabolites or ketones)， in addition to low pH， may contrib-ute to impaired function of retinal cells.\n\n【23】Timely dialysis seems to be very effective in the treatment of these patients. A recent report by Kinoshita et al showed good outcome even in a patient who had multiple risk factors for poor outcome and presented with very low pH (6.6)， high lactate (above 18 mmol/L)， and extremely elevated metfor-min concentration (77.5 mg/L， normal value below 2 mg/L).\n\n【24】Treatment of MALA mainly consists of supportive measures such as bicarbonate infusion and i.v. fluids to correct metabol-ic acidosis and to normalize lactic acid and pH levels. As MALA is frequently mistaken for lactic acidosis due to severe sepsis， these patients frequently receive inappropriate antibiotics . Some patients with MALA， especially those with complications such as blindness， may need renal replacement therapy (RRT). The pre-dialysis level of serum lactate is a marker of mortali-ty in MALA and was significantly higher in non-survivors (me-dian 22.5 mmol/L) than in survivors (median 17 mmol/L， p-value <0.01) . Modalities of RRT used to treat patients with MALA include peritoneal dialysis， intermittent RRT， prolonged intermittent RRT， and continuous RRT . A patient with MALA should undergo dialysis without interruption until their lactatelevel is less than 3 mmol/L . Vision loss seems to improve as soon as metabolic acidosis is corrected .\n\n| Case Author  | Year of  | AgeCountryLyears)  | Sex  | Presence of Presence of  |  | Baseline creatinine (mg/dL)  | Hypothermia  | Hypotension  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Case Author  | publication  | AgeCountryLyears)  | Sex  | diabetes  | CKD  | Baseline creatinine (mg/dL)  | Hypothermia  | Hypotension  |\n| Kreshak et al | 2010  | USA 67  | F  | Yes  | Yes  | 1.3  | Yes  | NO  |\n| Cigarranet al   | 2012  | Spain 54  | M  | Yes  | Yes  | 1.14  | NO  | Yes  |\n| Jeon et al   | 2019  | Korea 68  | M  | Yes  | Not  | Not  | Yes  | NO  |\n| Jeon et al   | 2019  | Korea 68  | M  | Yes  | reported  | reported  | Yes  | NO  |\n| Ryu et al   | 2019  | Korea 68  | M  | Yes  | NO  | 0.75  | Yes  | NO  |\n| Kalantriet al   | 2020  | USA 77  | F  | Yes  | Yes  | 1.4  | NO  | Yes  |\n|  |  | Gl tract  | Respiratory  | Peak  | Peak  | Lowest  | Dialysis  | Vision loss  |\n| Case Author  | Encephalopathy  | symptoms  | distress  | creatinine(mg/dL)  | lactate  | pH  | required  | outcome  |\n| Kreshaket al   | NO  | NO  | Yes  | 7  | 19.9  | 6.65  | Yes  | Recovered  |\n| Cigarranet al   | Yes  | Yes  | Yes  | 9.13  | 15.07  | 6.96  | Yes  | Recovered  |\n| Jeon et al   | NO  | Yes  | NO  | 2.31  | \\>11  | 6.78  | Yes  | Recovered  |\n| Ryu et al   | NO  | Yes  | NO  | 2.31  | \\>11  | 6.78  | Yes  | Recovered  |\n| Kalantriet al   | Yes  | Yes  | Yes  | 6.16  | 23.8  | <7  | Yes  | Recovered  |\n\n【26】Conclusions\n\n【27】Although rare， MALA is a serious and dramatic adverse ef-fect of metformin， even at therapeutic doses. Therefore， it should be suspected and considered in any patient on met-formin therapy who presents with lactic acidosis and blind-ness. Its incidence is predicted to rise over the next several years given the recent relaxation in eGFR restrictions for met-formin， and an increase in the prevalence of CKD. Prompt RRThas been demonstrated to be pivotal for recovery and signif-icantly lowers the morbidity and mortality associated with this condition.

Co-existing CDI and diabetes mellitus without inherited disorders such as Wolfram syndrome are rare. It is both important and challenging to diagnose this combination because the 2 conditions present with thirst， polydipsia， and polyuria. A few cases of CDI developing in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) have been reported. We report an unusual case of CDI that developed in an older patient with T2D. The aims of this report are to share the clinical course and discuss clues to the early diagnosis of CDI in T2D.\n\n【2】Case Report： A 70-year-old Japanese woman developed T2D with hyperglycemia symptoms， including thirst， polydipsia， and polyuria. After starting medical treatment， the hyperglycemia and its symptoms improved. The glycated he-moglobin level decreased from 9% to 6%. However， 5 years later (at 75 years of age)， she re-exhibited thirst， polydipsia， and polyuria despite stable glycemic control. Her urine volume was large (6.3 L/day). A urine glu-cose test was negative. The plasma osmolality was high (321 m0sm/kg)， while the urinary osmolality was low(125 mOsm/kg). A significant increase in urinary osmolality following vasopressin administration indicated a diagnosis of CDI. Desmopressin therapy effectively relieved the symptoms.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】This case highlights the need to consider CDI as a rare but important comorbid disorder in patients with dia-betes mellitus， including T2D， particularly those presenting with thirst， polydipsia， and polyuria despite well-controlled glycemia.\n\n【5】Keywords： Central Diabetes Insipidus · Desmopressin· Polyuria· Type 2 Diabetes MellitusCentral diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by a large volume of dilute urine because of a lack of the posterior pituitary hormone arginine vasopressin(AVP)， also known as antidiuretic hormone .

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is the most common form， characterized by a relative (rather than absolute) insu-lin deficiency and decreased insulin sensitivity.\n\n【7】It is both important and challenging to diagnose co-existing CDI and diabetes mellitus because the 2 conditions present with similar symptoms including thirst， polydipsia， and polyuria .\n\n【8】There are many reported cases of co-existing CDI and diabetes mellitus in patients with Wolfram syndrome， a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by CDI， ju-venile-onset diabetes mellitus， optic nerve atrophy， and sensori-neural deafness . The co-existence of CDI and diabetes melli-tus without inherited disorders  is rare. Co-existing CDI and type 1 diabetes mellitus have been reported in patients with polyglandular autoimmune syndrome . Although the etiologi-cal links remain unclear， several cases of CDI with T2D or diabetes mellitus of other etiologies  have been reported.\n\n【9】Although it is important to know the clinical characteristics of CDI that develops in patients being treated for T2D， as the number of patients with T2D has been increasing ，only a few cases have been reported . Here， we report the un-usual case of an older patient with T2D who developed CDI. The aims of this report are to share the clinical course and dis-cuss clues to the early diagnosis of CDI in T2D.\n\n【10】Case Report\n\n【11】A 70-year-old Japanese woman visited a primary care doctor due to a 2-month history of thirst， polydipsia， pollakisuria， and polyuria. Her family history included paternal T2D. No family member suffered from deafness， visual loss， diabetes insip-idus， or any renal tract or neurological abnormality. The pa-tient had never smoked cigarettes and did not drink alcohol. She had no history of a brain tumor， cerebrovascular disease， brain surgery， or radiation therapy. Her body weight had been approximately 46 kg in her 20s but gradually increased to 51kg when she was 70 years old； she then developed thirst， poly-dipsia，pollakisuria， and polyuria. Two months later， she visit-ed a primary care doctor， who noted a 3-kg body weight loss and hyperglycemia with a high glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level (9.0%). The patient was diagnosed with T2D accompa-nied by mild dyslipidemia and hypertension and was started on diet therapy， oral hypoglycemic agents \\[sitagliptin (50 mg/day) and metformin (500 mg/day)\\]， and the antihypertensive agent amlodipine (2.5 mg/day). Her hyperglycemia improved gradually， and the thirst， polydipsia，pollakisuria， and polyuria resolved. Her HbAlc level decreased to around 6%.\n\n【12】The patient subsequently developed thirst， polydipsia， pollaki-suria， and polyuria at 75 years of age， without any prodrome such as headache or head trauma， and she visited her prima-ry doctor. A blood test revealed fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c levels of 105 mg/dL and 6.7%， respectively； a urine glu-cose test was negative. She was first thought to have a blad-der problem， and oral solifenacin succinate (5 mg/day) was commenced. However， her symptoms persisted， and she was referred to our hospital and admitted.\n\n【13】On physical examination， she was 150 cm tall， weighed 43 kg(body mass index， 19.1 kg/m)，and her body temperature was36.7C， blood pressure 140/63 mmHg， and pulse rate 69 beats per minute. Her daily urine volume was large (6.3 L/day). Her mouth was dry. No heart murmurs， chest rales， or peripheral edema were detected.\n\n【14】Laboratory tests  revealed high serum sodium (158mEq/L) and chloride (121 mEq/L) levels， high plasma osmolal-ity (Posm； 321 mOsm/kg)， and low urinary osmolality (Uosm；125 mOsm/kg). The plasma AVP level was relatively low (0.6pg/mL) . These results suggested hypertonic dehydration and hypotonic polyuria because of inability of the kidneys to conserve body water and concentrate urine. We considered diabetes insipidus.\n\n【15】Because the patient had severe plasma hyperosmolality， we did not perform the water deprivation test or hypertonic saline test . Instead， we performed the vasopressin adminis-tration test， which revealed a drastic rise in Uosm from 73 to509 m0sm/kg， along with a reduced urine volume from 140to 15 mL/30 min， within 2 hours after intravenous vasopres-sin (5 units) administration . The significant increase in Uosm by up to 100% ruled out nephrogenic diabetes insip-idus and indicated a diagnosis of CDI .\n\n【16】Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected no morphological abnormalities in the brain including the hypothalamus，hypoph-yseal stalk， or pituitary gland. However， the high signal inten-sity of the posterior pituitary on T1-weighted images was ab-sent. These results were consistent with idiopathic CDI .\n\n【17】Table 1.

The dose was titrated up gradually on the basis of her polyuria， thirst， and electrolyte imbalance.\n\n【24】Dynamic tests for anterior pituitary hormone secretion re-vealed no anterior pituitary dysfunction.\n\n【25】To investigate possible co-existing autoimmune disorders ， serum autoantibodies against different organs were examined， and the patient tested positive for thyroglobulin autoantibody(94.0 IU/mL； reference range，<28.0 IU/mL). Neck ultrasonog-raphy revealed coarse， low echogenicity in a normal-sized thy-roid gland， suggesting Hashimoto thyroiditis . Because the patient had normal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (3.79ulU/mL) and free thyroxine (1.11 ng/dL) levels ，thy-roid hormone replacement therapy was not indicated.\n\n【26】Regarding the patient's diabetes mellitus， her fasting plas-ma glucose was 114 mg/dL and HbA1c level 6.6% . Her serum immunoreactive insulin level was 3.4 pU/mL and C-peptide immunoreactivity 1.8 ng/mL. Tests for pancreatic islet autoantibodies， such as giutamic acid decarboxylase au-toantibody， insulinoma-associated antigen-2 antibody， insulinantibody， islet cell antibody， and zinc transporter 8 antibody， were negative. These findings were consistent with a diagno-sis of T2D with a relatively preserved endogenous insulin se-cretion capacity. Funduscopy detected no diabetic retinopathy. The patient had no numbness in her hands or feet and had normal Achilles tendon reflexes.\n\n【27】Upon treatment of the CDI， after the desmopressin was in-creased to 300 pg/day， the urine volume decreased to around1 L/day . Her thirst， polydipsia， pollakisuria， and poly-uria resolved. The serum sodium and chloride levels， Posm， and Uosm also normalized. The patient was instructed to continue desmopressin therapy， was given information about an adequate daily water intake， and was discharged on day 28 of admission.\n\n【28】The patient's subsequent clinical course has been uneventful for more than 3 years.\n\n【29】Discussion\n\n【30】The clinica! features of diabetes mellitus in our patient， such as islet autoantibody negativity， relatively preserved endoge-nous insulin secretion capacity， comorbid hypertension， anddyslipidemia， and a family history of T2D supported the diag-nosis of T2D . Medical treatment with diet therapy and oral hypoglycemic agents controlled the hyperglycemia and its symptoms， and no chronic diabetic complications such as dia-betic retinopathy occurred. However， 5 years after the T2D de-veloped， the patient developed thirst， polydipsia， and polyuria， and was diagnosed with CDI. This case highlights the need for physicians to be aware of CDI as a rare but important comor-bid disorder in patients with diabetes mellitus， including T2D， especially in those who present with thirst， polydipsia， and polyuria despite well-controlled glycemia.\n\n【31】Table 3.

A 56-year-old man had simulta-neous CDI and T2D with no abnormal brain MRI findings . An obese 16-year-old boy developed T2D associated with non-ketotic severe hyperglycemia 2 months after undergoing brain surgery for craniopharyngioma and developing hypopituitarism with CDI . An obese 41-year-old man with a 5-year history of treated CDI developed T2D associated with hyperosmolar diabetic coma and was also diagnosed with Klinefelter syn-drome . There have also been a few reports of CDI that de-veloped in patients being treated for T2D ， as in our case.\n\n【35】Table 3 summarizes the characteristics of reported CDI cas-es that developed in patients with treated T2D. In a case of poorly controlled hyperglycemia， CDI was suspected due toworsening polyuria and a low urine specific gravity despite the presence of significant glucosuria， 10 years after the diagnosis of T2D . In another case， in a patient with a 2-year dura-tion of T2D， CDI was suspected because of recurring polyuria6 weeks after correcting the hyperglycemia with insulin ther-apy . Our patient initially developed T2D presenting with thirst， polydipsia， and polyuria. Medical treatment controlled the hyperglycemia and its symptoms. However， 5 years later， she re-exhibited thirst， polydipsia， and polyuria despite well-controlled glycemia and was diagnosed with CDI. Thus，regu-lar good glycemic control not only relieved the hyperglycemic symptoms but also helped us to detect CDI early.\n\n【36】CDI， a deficiency of AVP， may be inherited or acquired . Hereditary CDI is caused by mutations in the gene encoding AVP， and symptoms develop gradually at various ages during childhood . Acquired CDI has many causes， such as trau-matic brain injury， brain surgery， pituitary and hypothalamic tumors， and inflammatory， infiltrative， autoimmune， and vas-cular diseases . However， many acquired cases are idiopathic with no identifiable cause ； in these idiopathic cases， autoimmunity may be an etiology ， especially when other organ-specific autoimmune disorders are present . In the present case， because the patient had a negative fam-ily history for CDI and developed CDI at an advanced age， her CDI was likely to have been acquired. No morphological ab-normality in the intra- or suprasellar regions was detected on\n\n【37】MRl， while she exhibited an autoimmune thyroid disease . These findings suggested autoimmunity as a possible etiolo-gy for her idiopathic CDI.\n\n【38】The pathogenesis of T2D is also heterogeneous and involves many factors， including genetic and environmental ones， such as overeating， lack of physical activity， and resultant obesity . Unlike type 1 diabetes mellitus， T2D is not typically associat-ed with pancreatic autoimmunity. These findings suggest that there was no etiological link between our patient's CDI and T2D.\n\n【39】Conclusions\n\n【40】We describe an older patient with a 5-year history of well-treated T2D who developed thirst， polydipsia， and polyuria andwas diagnosed with CDI. Desmopressin therapy effectively re-lieved the symptoms. Physicians should be aware of CDI as a rare but important comorbid disorder in patients with diabetes mellitus， including T2D， especially in those who present with thirst， polydipsia， and polyuria despite well-controlled glycemia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The patient had a high white blood cell count， thrombocytopenia， renal/hepatic insufficiency and an urinary tract infection (UTI).

The reversible causes of multi-organ failure are often not readily identified； therefore， many patients experience rapid deterioration of their health.\n\n【8】We present a case of a severe form of leptospirosis present-ing as Weil’s disease， which is a rare endemic disease caus-ing acute renal failure and hyperbilirubinemia simultaneously.\n\n【9】Case Report\n\n【10】A 53-year-old man with no significant past medical history pre-sented with complaints of anuria over the previous two days. The patient was a visitor to the United States from Guyana. He reported that his symptoms started within a week of ar-rival to the United States， and included severe cramps in his thighs and chills. In the next few days， he noticed his urine had turned dark， which then progressed to anuria. The patient denied any fever， cough， shortness of breath， chest pain， di-arrhea， or sick contacts. He was a former smoker and former alcoholic， but had quit both smoking and consuming alcohol six months earlier.\n\n【11】On examination， the patient was mildly tachycardic with a blood pressure of 98/64 mm Hg. Positive physical examina-tion findings included icteric sclera， jaundice， and tenderness over abdomen， costovertebral angles， and thighs. His lab test results included white blood count of 6.6 K/mcL with bands of 18%， and platelets of 53 K/mcL， CK of 2104 units/L， BUN of84 mg/dL， creatinine of 9.07 mg/dL， and a deranged hepatic function panel， as shown in Table 1. Urinalysis (done with a very small quantity of urine) was positive for leukocyte esterase， moderate amounts of blood， and protein. With the limited lab-oratory data available， the patient was initially treated for the suspicion of acute kidney injury secondary to rhabdomyolysisand pyelonephritis. Intravenous ceftriaxone 1 g daily was start-ed while results from a viral hepatitis and autoimmune work-up was pending. The patient’s condition continued to deteri-orate with decreasing platelet counts， worsening renal failure， and hyperbilirubinemia. Hemodialysis was then initiated as per nephrology consultation； however， this did not make any difference in the patient's clinical condition. Over a course of72 hours from the initial presentation， the patient had devel-oped severe respiratory distress. Chest x-ray revealed diffuse relatively symmetric interstitial infiltrates and ground glass opacities suggesting pulmonary edema or diffuse pneumoni-tis. Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome was suspected and broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and Zosyn， both given in renal doses) were administered. Intravenous doxycy-cline 100 mg every 12 hours was also started empirically for high suspicion of leptospirosis from the patient's travel his-tory as well as his rapid clinical deterioration.\n\n【12】The patient's condition started to improve drastically after ini-tiation of doxycycline. Other antibiotics were discontinued. On subsequent days， the patient’s Leptospira antibody results were available and showed titers of more than 1：3200. Blood cul-tures， which were sent without any special media， remained negative throughout hospitalization. Workup for viral and au-toimmune hepatitis was also negative. Hemodialysis was dis-continued when the patient started producing urine with im-proved kidney function.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Leptospirosis is a zoonosis caused by pathogenic spirochetes of the genus Leptospira. The incidence in the tropics is approx-imately 10 times higher than in temperate regions J. Human infection usually results from exposure to environmental sourc-es， such as animal urine， contaminated water or soil， or infect-ed animal tissue. Portals of entry include cuts or abraded skin， mucous membranes， or conjunctivae. In the tropics， endemicleptospirosis is mainly a disease of poverty . It is acquired through occupational exposure (subsistence farming) and liv-ing in rodent-infested， flood-prone urban slums . The illness generally presents with the abrupt onset of fever， rigors， myal-gia， and headache in 75% to 100% of patients， following an in-cubation period of 2 to 26 days (average 10 days). Severe，po-tentially fatal illness characterized by jaundice and renal failure(“Weil's disease\") occurs in a minority of patients. Pulmonary hemorrhage is a potential complication . The fatality rate in hospitalized patients with leptospirosis ranges from 4% to52%. Leptospirosis may be complicated by renal failure， uveitis， pulmonary hemorrhage， acute respiratory distress syn-drome (ARDS)， myocarditis， and rhabdomyolysis .\n\n| Day of presentation  | Aphos  | AST  | GGT  | ALT  | LDH  | ALB  | TBil  | Bili.

Thrombocytopenia can also occur. Hyponatremia is common in severe leptospirosis. Serological tests are used most frequent-ly for diagnosis of leptospirosis .Assays include the micro-scopic agglutination test， macroscopic agglutination test， in-direct hemagglutination， and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) . Blood and CSF specimens are generally positive during the first 10 days of the illness. Treatment in-cludes administration of antimicrobials like oral doxycycline or oral azithromycin. Amoxicillin is an alternative therapy. For se-vere leptospirosis， parenteral penicillin， doxycycline，and third-generation cephalosporin are all acceptable options.\n\n【17】On further interviewing， our patient admitted to previous work on a farm and that he was often exposed to rodents. This ex-posure occurred just before coming to the United States. His symptoms started with myalgia and rhabdomyolysis. His dis-ease then progressed to hemolysis causing hyperbilirubinemia， and rhabdomyolysis causing acute renal failure. Not surpris-ingly， laboratory findings included anemia， thrombocytope-nia， hyponatremia， high creatinine kinase， elevated bilirubin， and elevated BUN and creatinine. Chest x-ray showed find-ings consistent with pulmonary edema， which was likely pul-monary hemorrhage or ARDS. All these findings were consis-tent with severe complicated leptospirosis. We suggest， based on our case report， that clinicians should have a high index of suspicion when encountering patients with recent travels to the tropics who present with rapidly progressing kidney fail-ure and hyperbilirubinemia.\n\n【18】Conclusions\n\n【19】As world travel becomes more economically feasible， we will continue to encounter foreign endemic diseases. Leptospirosis presenting as Weil’'s disease is a common cause of renal failure and hyperbilirubinemia in endemic areas.

However， the radiological findings of cholesterol granuloma can be similar to those of breast cancer， and imaging alone may not be able to distin-guish between the two conditions.\n\n【8】This report is of a case of concomitant cholesterol granulo-ma with an invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast eval-uated with Virtual Touch IQ (VTIQ) shear wave elastography used in the ultrasound assessment of the breast lesions and MRI， including T1-weighted DCE-MRl， before biopsy and his topathology of both lesions.\n\n【9】Case Report\n\n【10】In previously published cases of isolated cholesterol granulo-ma of the breast， the imaging diagnosis has been described with the use of mammography and ultrasound . However， the diagnosis of cholesterol granuloma of the breast has rarely been reported by ultrasound combined with shear wave elas-tography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)， including dy-namic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI).\n\n【11】A 52-year-old woman， with a previous history of intraduct papillomas in both breasts， underwent six-monthly follow-up breast imaging. Routine mammography showed nodular densities with benign-looking calcifications in both breasts， and the ultrasound showed some homogeneous bilateral hy-poechoic breast nodules.\n\n【12】The most recent breast ultrasound showed a progressive-ly enlarging oval mass in the upper inner quadrant (UIQ) of the left breast， and an adjacent irregular mass showingmicrocalcifications on mammography. The patient had no family history of breast cancer or recent breast trauma， and she had no history of disorders of metabolic lipid disorders. Therefore， at our hospital， she underwent a series of breast imaging tests for the two suspicious breast masses of the left.\n\n【13】Mammographic imaging was performed using the diagnos-tic categories of the breast imaging-reporting and data sys-tem (BI-RADS) classification from the American College of Radiology (ACR)， as follows： Category l： negative； Category ll：benign； Category IIl： probably benign， short interval follow-up suggested； Category IV： suspicious abnormality； Category Ⅳa：low level of suspicion for malignancy； Category Mb： intermedi-ate suspicion of malignancy； Category IVc： moderate suspicion for malignancy； Category V： highly suggestive of malignancy， action should be taken； Category VI： biopsy-proven malignancy.\n\n【14】Mammography showed a recent cluster of amorphous mi-crocalcifications in the upper inner quadrant (UIQ) of the left breast， classified as BI-RADS Category Ic . Breast ul-trasound showed an enlarging and irregular hypoechoic mass with suspicious areas of calcification in the lower portion of this lesion， which was categorized as BI-RADS IVc . Virtual Touch IQ (VTIQ) (Siemens) shear wave elastography was used in the ultrasound assessment， which showed that the mass showed marked stiffness and considerably increased ultrasound velocities in the mass compared with the surround-ing breast tissue . A further nodule with similar so-nographic and elastographic imaging results was observed inher right breast. Because of the presence of multicentric le-sions in both breasts， she was counseled to undergo breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before biopsy.\n\n【15】Using breast MRI， two distinct masses adjacent to each other were identified in the deep upper inner quadrant (UIQ) of the left breast. The oval mass (size， 7.3×5.3 mm) exhibited homo-geneous high signal intensity on T1-weighted fat saturation(T1WFS) MRI  and mixed intermediate signal inten-sities on T2-weighted short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) MRI. The oval mass exhibited high signal intensity on diffusion-weighted images (DWIs)  and signal void on the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map .\n\n【16】Using T1-weighted imaging dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI(DCE-MRI)， the oval lesion also exhibited mild enhancement and a Type I (benign) curve . The other irregular mass (size， 11.0x6.0 mm) showed an iso-intense T1 signal and a high T2 signal on fat-saturation imaging with a mild signal drop on the ADC map and a Type Ill (malignant) enhancing curve on the T1-weighted DCE-MRI .\n\n【17】Initially， both lesions in the left breast were suspicious for ma-lignancy， on imaging alone. However， ultrasound-guided biop-sy of the oval mass showed cholesterol clefts with a foreign-body inflammatory reaction. Because this benign histology was unexpected， the patient was advised to have a mammogra-phy-guided needle localization and surgical excision of the ir-regular mass showing microcalcifications. The histopathologicdiagnosis showed that the oval lesion was a cholesterol gran-uloma and that the irregular lesion containing microcalcifica-tions was a Grade 2 invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. The nodule in the right breast was histologically di-agnosed as an area of benign fibrocystic change following ul-trasound-guided core needle biopsy.\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】Cholesterol granulomas are unusual benign lesions that can occur at various sites in the human body， most commonly in the middle ear and mastoid process but are rarely found in the breast tissue. Cholesterol granulomas arising in the breast are believed to result from mammary duct ectasia. Mammary duct ectasia is a benign process that is associated with periductal inflammation， including plasma cell mastitis and mastitis ob-literans， which may result in rupture of the dilated duct with the release of lipid-rich intraluminal material that forms cho-lesterol clefts or crystals in the surrounding granulation tis-sue. The lipids released into the breast tissue also result in a foreign body giant cell reaction .\n\n【20】In previously published studies， cholesterol granulomas have been shown to result in nonspecific mammographic findings， but microcalcifications have also been observed in several cas-es . The reported ultrasound findings in cholesterol gran-uloma of the breast have included lobular hypoechoic mass-es or intracystic masses .\n\n【21】In this case report， ultrasound findings showed that there were clusters of amorphous microcalcifications that were mainly associated with invasive ductal carcinoma. In previously pub-lished cases， both mammography and ultrasonography alone have been unable to distinguish between benign cholester-ol granuloma and breast cancer . Shear wave elastogra-phy can be used in the ultrasound assessment of the breast lesions， and the findings of this method in cases of invasive ductal carcinoma have been well described in the previously published literature ， but the use of elastography in im-aging cholesterol granuloma has not been reported previously. In this present case， the elastographic findings for cholester-ol granuloma were considered to be similar to those of inva-sive ductal carcinoma， although artifacts in the method and its interpretation might be generated due to the coexistence of these two tumors and their proximity in the same breast.\n\n【22】Using T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI)， the imaging characteristics of the cholesterol granuloma were related to the varied components of the lesion. Cholesterolclefts showed both a high signal intensity on T1-weighted and T2-weighted images， and low-signal intensity on T1-weighted fat saturation (T1WFS) images were suggestive of a fattycomponent. The outer hypointense rim on the T2-weighted images was most likely due to hemosiderin deposition.\n\n【23】Cholesterol granuloma that arises in the petrosal bone and mastoid antrum has been shown to be a less-enhancing lesion on MRI . However， cholesterol granuloma of the breast has been previously shown to be an enhancing lesion by dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging， and with masses showing mild fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-uptake in combined positron emission tomography (PET)-CT imag-ing . The MRI findings in this case are consistent with those of previously published cases but also， this case report has highlighted the value of the use of T1-weighted DCE-MRI which exhibited a typical benign enhancing curve (Type l) for the cholesterol granuloma. The diffusion-restricted character-istics identified on the diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map of the left breast were also supportive for the diagnosis of cholesterol and fat deposition. Therefore， this case supports the importance of us-ing MRI of the breast to distinguish between cholesterol gran-uloma from breast cancer.\n\n【24】The presentation of this case is important because cholesterol granuloma and invasive ductal carcinoma are difficult to dis-tinguish when they exist together . In this patient， the ini-tial diagnosis was made of a solitary breast tumor when ul-trasound， mammography， and shear-wave elastography were used. However， T1-weighted DCE-MRI identified two distinct tumors through their different patterns of contrast-enhance-ment and their diffusion-restricted characteristics . Also， although the presence of microcalcifications in a breast lesion on imaging is an association with malignancy， it can occur in benign lesions associated with chronic inflammation .\n\n【25】Therefore， in this case， biopsy followed by mammographic guided surgical excision was used for both breast masses. In this present case， breast T1-weighted DCE-MRI was shown to be particularly helpful in clinical decision-making， especially when multifocal lesions or bilateral breast lesions are pres ent. From the findings of this case report， breast T1-weighted DCE-MRI may be considered by clinicians should surgical ex-cision not be feasible for the patient.\n\n【26】Conclusions\n\n【27】Although cholesterol granuloma can be indistinguishable from breast cancer on mammography， ultrasonography， and shear-wave elastography， this case report has shown that it can be diagnosed using T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced mag-netic resonance imaging (DCE-MRl)， which uses a time-sig-nal intensity curve， or kinetic curve. Following repeated DCE-MRI scans， three types of time-signal intensity curves may be produced： persistent enhancing (Type 1)； plateau (Type 2)；or washout (Type 3). The Type 1 DCE-MRI persistent enhancing curve shows a persistent increase in the intensity of the MRI signal and correlates with benign lesions， including choles-terol granuloma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The patient had a protein C level of less than 1% and her parents were cases of asymptomatic heterozygous protein C deficiency. Since purified protein C concentrate was not available， administration of fresh frozen plasma was commenced for the patient leading to a relative improvement in necrotic skin lesions. Because of multiple venous punctures and poor peripheral venous access， jugular vein catheterization was done to establish an efficient intravenous line for administration of fresh frozen plasma. Finally， after a few days， superior vena cava syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation developed， and the patient expired. Autopsy showed extensive thrombosis of central veins.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】When protein C concentrate is not available， newborns with homozygous protein C deficiency are at a greater risk of central vein line-related deep venous thrombosis， which may occur as a short-term complication； therefore， in these patients， central vein catheterization should be avoided as far as possible， and be considered only as the final therapeutic decision for poor venous access.\n\n【6】Key words： neonate · protein C deficiency · purpura fulminans· central venous catheterizationProtein C is a vitamin K-dependent protein， synthe-sized by the liver. Activated protein C is a natural anticoagulant that cleaves two activated coagulation factors， factor Va and factor VIIIa， thereby inhibiting the conversion of factor X to factor Xa and prothrom-bin to thrombin.\n\n【7】Protein C also plays fibrinolytic， anti-inflammatory， anti-ischemic roles . Depending on its severity， Protein C deficiency can cause a variety of problems such as venous thrombosis， purpura fulminans and disseminated intravascular coagulation .\n\n【8】Pupura fulminans is characterized by rapidly-progres-sive microvascular thrombosis in the dermis followed by perivascular hemorrhage and necrosis .\n\n【9】However， newborns rarely develop a syndrome of purpura fulminans which is associated with the laboratory evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation and the protein C antigen level of less than 1% of normal value .\n\n【10】Reasons for morbidity and mortality due to homo-zygous protein C deficiency include neonatal purpura fulminans and massive thrombosis. Ef-fective treatment for protein C deficiency can be instituted with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or protein C replacement. During initial treatment， if there is poor peripheral venous access， central venous access represents one of the optional basic therapeutic procedures . Complications of central venous catheterization include infection， embolization， deep vein thrombosis (DVT)， and rarely， pericatheter calcification. Clinical symptoms of acute central vein line (CVL)-related DVT are blockage of the CVL， swelling， pain and discoloration of the involved limb， and swelling of face and neck . The overall mortality rate with thromoembolization is reported to be 16%.\n\n【11】Herein， a case of protein C deficiency is presented who developed extensive thrombosis following central vein catheterization for FFP infusion when protein C concentrate was not available.\n\n【12】CASE REPORT\n\n【13】A neonate was admitted to NICU due to progressive skin necrosis of the lower part of her abdomen and her buttock at 2 days of age. The patient was a full-term， female neonate， a product of caesarean section due to breech presentation， with a good Apgar score and a birth weight of 3500 grams. Shewas the first child of her apparently healthy parents who were first- degree relatives.\n\n【14】She did not have any family history of hematologic disorders， and there were no abnormal findings in her mother's laboratory tests during pregnancy.\n\n【15】The patient was well up to 24 hours after birth， when her problem started with ecchymosis of the lower part of her abdomen and her buttock， with some bula on the mentioned sites. Then the lesions progressed to necrosis. Despite necrotic lesions， neurologic reflexes were normal and no other findings were detected in the physical exam.\n\n【16】Laboratory values were： first hemoglobin： 17 mg/dl， which gradually decreased to 8mg/dl， white blood cell count： 22×10° /uL with 47% granulocytes and50% lymphocytes； platelet count： 150 ×10° /uL； prothrombin time (PT) > 2 min. (control 13 sec)； partial thromboplastin time (PTT)> 2 min. (control35 sec)； C-reactive protein (CRP)： 12 mg/dl.\n\n【17】Liver function test， blood sugar， urea， serum sodium and potassium levels were all normal. Blood culture was negative as well. The patient was initially treated with clindamycin， ceftazidim， and amikacin， and with the suspicion of anticoagulant deficiency， she and her parents were checked for protein C， protein S， and fibrinogen level (IL 9000， IL Company，USA). Without waiting for the lab results， administration of FFP， vitamin K and packed cell were started. After supportive care， PT and PTT turned normal and cutaneuos lesions regressed. Lab data， then， showed normal protein S and fibrinogen levels in the patient and her parents， but the protein C level in the patient， her mother， and her father was less than 1%，32.8%， and 45% respectively. Since protein C concentrate is not available in our country， infusion of FFP with the dose of 15 cc/kg every 12hours was continued. Color Doppler sonography of abdominal and kidney vessels， and echocardiography were normal.\n\n【18】Two weeks later， in spite of antibiotic therapy， super-imposed skin infection developed and CRP increased to 48 mg/dl. The skin infection was controlled with the debridment of the necrotic tissue and changing of antibiotic regimen to vancomycin and imipenem.\n\n【19】Skin culture was positive with Acinetobacter. Due to poor venous access for IV insertion， jugular vein catheterization was done for her. After 6 days， she developed edema of upper chest and neck with re-spiratory distress. PT and PTT became prolonged again； therefore， administration of antithromboticagents was impossible. She was under mechanical ventilation for 2 days. Finally， she expired. Autopsy revealed extensive central vein thrombosis.\n\n【20】DISCUSSION\n\n【21】Homozygous protein C deficiency usually results in purpura fulminans or thrombotic complications occurring during the neonatal period. Purpura ful-minans is a least in part a cutaneous manifestation of the syndrome of systemic DIC .\n\n【22】These lesions occur mainly on the extremities but can occur on the buttocks， abdomen， scrotom， scalp， pressure points and also at sites of previous punc-tures \n\n【23】Other complications consist of cerebral manifesta-tions such as thrombosis of dural sinuses， multiple central infarction， blindness secondary to vitreous hemorrhage and on rare occasions， large vessel thrombosis.\n\n【24】The age of onset of the first symptoms ranges from a few hours to 2 weeks after birth， usually after an uncomplicated full term pregnancy and delivery. In contrast to the genetic form， acquired neonatal pro-tein C deficiency occurs particularly in ill preterm neonates91.\n\n【25】Protein C level can also vary depending on age. In newborns it is 20% to 40% of the normal adult level. and preterm infants have even lower levels.\n\n【26】In initial treatment， FFP (10-20 cc/kg every 6-12hours) is usually the form of therapy that is most readily available； however， the half-life of protein C in circulation is only about 6 to 16 hours， and the frequent administration of plasma is limited by the development of hyperproteinemia， hypertension，loss of venous access， and fluid overload .\n\n【27】The availability of a purified protein C concentrate now allows specific replacement of protein C， avo-iding complications of FFP replacement .\n\n【28】Poor peripheral venous access is a complication of frequent FFP or protein C replacement in newborns，and central venous access presents one of the most therapeutic procedures in modern medicine .\n\n【29】Besides systemic infections， venous thrombosis con-stitutes a major complication of central lines used in neonatal intensive care . Review articles have shown that jugular vein thrombosis is a long-term complication in neonates after catheterization .\n\n【30】Other problems of CVL-related DVT include death from extension into the heart or pulmonary embo-lism， chylothorax， and superior vena caval throm-bosis1.\n\n【31】In our case we started FFP infusion because pro-tein C concentrate was not available， and the pa-tient showed improvement of skin leisions； however， loss of peripheral venous access for the purpose of FFP administration made jugular vein cathete-rization inevitable. After 6 days， she developed extensive thrombosis in the large central veins and expired due to superior vena cava syndrome and DIC as a short-term complication of central vein catheterization.\n\n【32】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【33】In conclusion：\n\n【34】·Newborns with homozygous protein C deficiency are at a greater risk of CVL-related DVT when they are not treated with protein C； therefore， when pro-tein C is not available. central venous catheterization should be considered only as the final therapeutic procedure for poor venous access.\n\n【35】· CVL-related DVT may happen as a short-term com-plication in these patients， although according to the literature it is said to occur in a long term period； therefore， investigation for detecting thrombosis including high-resolution ultrasonography should routinely be performed in the short-term follow-up of these newborns.\n\n【36】ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\n【37】The authors would like to thank Dr. M.H.

The onset mechanism involves intracellular transport of phosphorus， po-tassium， and water， in association with rapid glucose administration. The resulting hypophosphatemia is ex-tremely dangerous and can cause severe heart failure and fatal arrhythmia. We successfully used extracor-poreal cardiopulmonary support to manage a case of refeeding syndrome that occurred during the course of treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. There are only a few reports of the use of cardiopulmonary support for the treatment of refeeding syndrome.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】A 72-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. Despite receiving ins ulin and nutrition therapy， QT prolongation and ventricular fibrillation appeared on the electrocardiogram. Although coronary angiography was performed in consideration of the possibility of ischemic heart disease， no signifi-cant stenosis of the coronary arteries was identified. Due to persistent hypotension and recurrence of ventric-ular fibrillation， extracorporeal cardiopulmonary support was commenced in the ICU. His serum phosphorus level showed a marked decrease on his first day in the ICU， for which daily replacement therapy was adminis-tered during his ICU stay. No fatal arrhythmia developed thereafter. He was weaned off extracorporeal cardio-pulmonary support on the fourth day of his ICU stay and was subsequently discharged from the hospital. We suggest vigilant monitoring of electrolytes， including phosphate levels， in diabetic ketoacidosis patients， and active circulatory support， as required， in patients with refeeding syndrome.\n\n【5】Keywords： Diabetic Ketoacidosis·Extracorporeal Circulation · Refeeding Syndrome\n\n【6】Refeeding syndrome (RFS) is a complex metabolic disorder that develops following rapid nutritional administration after a long period of undernutrition. The mechanism of onset involves in-tracellular transport of phosphorus， potassium， magnesium and water due to increased insulin secretion in response to rapid glucose administration. The resulting hypophosphatemia is ex-tremely dangerous and can cause severe heart failure and le-thal arrhythmia. However， RFS has no clear diagnostic criteria， although the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines provide RFS practice guidelines .\n\n【7】Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an emergency situation relat-ed to diabetes， in which hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia develop during the treatment process with administration of insulin. Therefore， it should be noted that RFS and DKA ex-hibit pathological similarities， which obscure the onset of RFS.\n\n【8】We successfully used extracorporeal cardiopulmonary sup-port to manage a case of RFS that occurred during the course of treatment of DKA. There are only a few previous reports of the use of cardiopulmonary support for the treatment of RFS.\n\n【9】Case Report\n\n【10】A 72-year-old man who had eaten almost no food for 2 weeks visited the cardiology department of our hospital due to pro-gressive dizziness. His medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus， familial hypercholesterolemia， old myocardial infarc-tion， aortic valve replacement， coronary artery bypass surgery， cerebral infarction， sigmoid colon cancer surgery， and alcohol-ic liver injury. He did not eat a sufficient amount of food on adaily basis and was a heavy drinker (daily volume： 350 ml of beer， 250 ml of shochu). He was under treatment for diabetes with an SGLT2 inhibitor (empagliflozin 10 mg/day).\n\n【11】At his presentation to our hospital， he had a blood glucose level of 352 mg/dL and blood hydroxybutyric acid level of 2.8mmol/L (normal value： 0.6 mmol/L or less)， and his arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.39， PaO， of 83 mmHg， PaCO， of 17 mmHg， base excess of -14.1 mmol/L， and lac-tate of 19 mg/dL (on room air， at a respiratory rate of 30breaths/min)， based on which he was diagnosed with diabet-ic ketoacidosis (DKA) and was admitted to the cardiology de-partment of our hospital.\n\n【12】Examination revealed the following： height 159 cm， weight 55kg， and clear consciousness. His blood pressure was 128/76mmHg， heart rate was 130 beats/min， respiratory rate was 34breaths/min， and Spo， was 95% (while breathing room air)， in-dicating tachycardia and tachypnea. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed negative T waves in precordial leads ll， ⅢIl， aVF， and V4 to V6 ， but transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed no cardiac wall motion abnormality， and his left ven-tricular ejection fraction (EF) was 71%. Blood tests showed no elevation of myocardial enzymes. His serum potassium level at this time was 3.3 mEq/L and phosphorus level was not tested.\n\n【13】Clinical Course\n\n【14】Continuous intravenous infusion of fast-acting insulin was start-ed， but since his blood glucose level dropped to 69 mg/dL after about 3 hours， the infusion was discontinued and bolus dos-es of insulin were administered using a sliding scale of blood glucose measurements. Serum potassium levels were moni-tored by blood gas analysis every 2-3 hours and potassium wassupplemented targeting a serum level of 3.5 mEq/L or high-er， resulting in 60 mEq being administered on the first day of hospitalization and 40 mEq on the second day. On the first hospital day， 1000 ml of 5% glucose and 2800 ml of normal saline were infused for correction of hypovolemia and abso lute hyponatremia. Since he was unable to receive oral feed-ing thereafter， 300 kcal of parenteral nutrition and 1000 ml of an infusion consisting of vitamin B1， sugar， electrolytes， and an amino acid solution (containing 35 mEq of sodium， 20 mEq of potassium， and 10 mEq of phosphorus) were given from the second day onwards. Plasma sodium levels were as low as 123 mEg/L on the first day of hospitalization， but increased to 136 mEq/L on the third day with fluid replacement and a small quantity of oral ingestion. For nutritional management， oral intake was permitted from the first day of hospitalization， although only a few meals were given， and about half of the intake was possible on the second day. However， on the third day， oral intake was discontinued due to transient hypotension with systolic blood pressure in the 70 mmHg range. From the afternoon of the fourth day of hospitalization， 400 kcal of na-sal enteral nutrition was started， in addition to 840 kcal and1000 mL of high-calorie infusion. His arterial blood gas analy-sis on the fourth day showed a pH of 7.44， PaO， of 80 mmHg， PaCO， of 31 mmHg， base excess of -2.9 mmol/L， and lactate of7 mg/dL (on room air and at a respiratory rate of 21 breaths/min). Phosphate levels were not monitored on the first day of admission to the cardiology department and for the 3 days pri-or to admission to the ICU. Similarly， calcium and magnesium levels were not monitored at that time. On the sixth hospital day， various examinations were performed because of the ap-pearance of chest pain， but myocardial escape enzymes were not elevated， although V1-V3 on the ECG showed T wave in-version and prolongation of QTc to 0.53 seconds . On the seventh hospital day， the patient developed repeated episodes of ventricular fibrillation (Vf) and polymorphic ven-tricular tachycardia. His serum potassium level at this time was as low as 2.9 mEg/L and ionized calcium level was 1.21mmol/L， which is the lower limit of normal. Coronary angiog raphy (CAG) revealed no ischemic heart disease. Vf recurred multiple times during CAG， and the return of regular rhythm was induced by defibrillation and continuous intravenous injec-tion of lidocaine and an intravenous magnesium preparation， although we decided to intubate his trachea due to persistent hypotension.Subsequently， since his hemodynamics could not be maintained due to repeated Vf， veno-arterial extracorpore-al membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) and intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP) were introduced in the angiography suite for cardiopulmonary support while treating his heart failure， and he was transferred to our ICU. ECMO was performed at a flow rate of 3.6 L/min， and arterial blood gas analysis from the right radial artery showed a pH of 7.55， PaO， of 70 mmHg， PaCo， of26 mmHg， and lactate of 16 mg/dL (on an FiO， of 0.45 or less and peak inspiratory pressure of 20 cmH，O or less). His bloodpressure was 123/49 mmHg and heart rate was 79 beats/min. TTE showed apical hyperconstriction and basal akinesis， which was diagnosed as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. By this time， his EF had decreased to the 20% range. Based on the above ob-servations， he was considered to have developed RFS， because QT prolongation and potentially lethal arrhythmia appeared af-ter nutritional care for chronic undernutrition， and his serum phosphorus level was significantly reduced to 0.8 mg/dL After admission to the ICU， 30 mmol of sodium phosphate was slow-ly administered， and potassium was supplemented appropri-ately. Since vitamin B1 deficiency can cause beriberi， 100 mg of a vitamin B1 preparation was administered for 3 consec-utive days (vitamin B1 concentration was found to be within the normal range of 40 mg/dL before supplementation). The calorie dose on the first day of admission to the ICU was 480kcal intravenously. On his second day in the ICU， his serum phosphorus level increased to 3.1 mg/dL and potassium level to 3.6 mEq/L，although the ECG still showed a prolonged QTc of 0.53 seconds. On his third day in the ICU， EF improved to33%， but pulmonary arterial pressure was low； hence， extra-cellular fluid loading was performed and ECMO settings were lowered to 3100 rpm and 2.9 L/min. As nutritiona. therapy on the third ICU day， 480 kcal were administered as parenteral nutrition and 600 kcal were administered as enteral nutrition. Thereafter， enteral nutrition was increased， and serum phos-phorus and potassium levels were monitored daily and cor-rected accordingly . No potentially lethal arrhyth-mia appeared after his first day of ICU admission. On day 4 of his ICU stay， QTc was 0.50 seconds and EF had improved to49.5%，and hence， VA-ECMO was withdrawn. After withdraw-al of ECMO， his blood pressure was 105/58 mmHg and heart rate was 85 beats/min with administration of noradrenaline.0.11 pg/kg/min and an IABP drive ratio of 1： 2. IABP support was withdrawn on the fifth ICU day. After sedation was dis-continued， it was confirmed that there was no disturbance of consciousness， and the patient was weaned off the ventilator on day 6 of his ICU stay. He was moved from the ICU to the general ward on the ninth day of ICU admission. Thereafter， it took 4 days for his QTc to normalize (QTc <0.44). The pa-tient is currently on a moderate diet and consumes alcohol moderately， and regularly visits the outpatient clinic on foot.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】We experienced a case of RFS that presented mainly as cardi-ac failure during the treatment of DKA in a patient with diabe-tes and chronic malnutrition. A good prognosis was obtained with IABP and VA-ECMO for circulatory management and nu-tritional management under strict monitoring of electrolytes.\n\n【17】Generally， RFS occurs in patients with severe malnutrition . Undernutrition leads to depletion of intracellular electrolytesand re-nutrition in that state promotes insulin secretion and catabolism， resulting in consumption of large amounts of elec-trolytes， such as phosphorus， magnesium， and potassium， and of vitamin B1 . Furthermore， transport of these elec-trolytes from the blood to the intracellular compartment re-duces their blood concentrations， which might lead to fatal ar-rhythmia， heart failure， and convulsions. During DKA treatment，potassium levels are often low due to the action of insulin ， which might mask the onset of RFS， which also causes hypo-kalemia. Both DKA and RFS are often seen in patients with malnutrition. Physicians should be aware that in cases of RFS associated with DKA， the diagnosis of RFS might be delayed， with fatal outcomes.\n\n【18】RFS can cause various dysfunctions， such as heart failure， cen-tral nervous system dysfunction， hemolysis， and leukocyte dysfunction. In particular， the cardiovascular symptoms can be severe， and there are reports of Takotsubo cardiomyopa-thy caused by RFS， as seen in the present case . Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is recognized as a type of catecholamine-in-duced cardiomyopathy.Occurrence of coronary artery spasm， microcirculatory disturbances， intracellular calcium overload as a result of direct cardiotoxicity of catecholamines，and free radical-mediated myocardial damage have been suggested as the pathogenic mechanisms . In catecholamine cardiomy-opathy， since left ventricular wall motion improves relatively quickly，the pathology is reported to involve myocardial stun-ning . Since VA-ECMO was withdrawn after 4 days in our case， the stunned myocardium was believed to have been back-ground pathophysiology. There is only one previous report of introduction of VA-ECMO for cardiac failure due to RFS ， and that report also suggested the need for extracorporeal support for treatment of the cardiac failure caused by RFS.\n\n【19】In the present case， the patient’s background comorbidities of cardiac complications， diabetes， and malnutrition asso-ciated with polydipsia were initially not adequately consid-ered， and it is possible that the focus was excessively on the treatment of DKA. As a result， recognition of the onset of RFS was delayed. For the same reason， it is possible that enter-al nutrition was not stably administered until the fourth dayof hospitalization， which could have precipitated the cardi-ac failure secondary to electrolyte abnormalities. It is not un-common for hypophosphatemia to develop during treatment of DKA. Hypophosphatemia is common with insulin adminis-tration， although the decline is usually acute and self-limit-ing， and phosphate supplementation is considered unneces-sary in most DKA patients. A previous prospective randomized controlled trial did not show an improvement in clinical out-comes of DKA with phosphorus supplementation， although overdose has the potential to cause severe hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia . Hence， serum phosphorus levels should be monitored closely， and if hypophosphatemia causes cardi-ac or respiratory failure， aggressive phosphorus replacement should be performed.\n\n【20】Conclusions\n\n【21】We treated a patient with RFS with potentially fatal arrhythmia and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy who survived with extracorpo-real cardiac support. Hypophosphatemia is likely to occur dur-ing the treatment of DKA， which requires rigorous electrolyte monitoring to prevent RFS. Our experience suggests the need for rigorous electrolyte monitoring and correction of electro-lyte imbalance in DKA， as well as performance of active car-diac support in cases of severe RFS with shock or potential-ly fatal arrhythmias.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Increased IgG4 serum levels support the diagnosis of lgG4-RD and character-istic histopathology of fibrous infiltrates or masses containing lgG4-positive plasma cells. We present the case of a 61-year-old woman with low back pain who was diagnosed with IgG4-RD involving the thoracoabdominal aorta and retroperitoneum.\n\n【2】Case Report： A 61-year-old woman who had persistent low back pain was referred to a university hospital in South Korea. Computed tomography (CT) and 2-F\\]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography/CT (F-18-FDG-PET/CT) demonstrated diffuse circumferential infiltrates from the thoracoabdominal aorta， iliac vessels， and retroperitoneum associated with right obstructive uropathy. The serum lgG4 concentration was 418.0 mg/L(reference range： 30-2000). She underwent laparoscopic retroperitoneal biopsy and received a cystoscopic dou-ble-J ureteral stent. IgG4-positive plasma cells， lymphoplasmacytic infiltration， and fibrosis were observed on histopathological examination. She was diagnosed with IgG4-RD and treated with glucocorticoids (GCs) for 6months. She underwent femoral-to-femoral bypass graft surgery for revascularization due to occlusion of the right iliac arteries. She experienced relapse after GC discontinuation， and GC administration was resumed. She had difficulty tapering GC use owing to persistent low back pain， which improved with combined treatment of GC and immunosuppressant.\n\n【3】Conclusions： We present a case of IgG4-RD involving the thoracoabdominal aorta and retroperitoneum based on the 2019classification criteria. The importance of radiological studies of IgG4-RD has increased， and F-18-FDG-PET/CT， which is a functional imaging modality of the whole body， is a valuable evaluation method for diagnosis and clinical outcomes.\n\n【4】Keywords： Glucocorticoids·Immunoglobulin G4-Related Disease· Mediastinal Fibrosis· Retroperitoneal FibrosisImmunoglobulin G4-related disease (lgG4-RD)， comprising disease entities of systemic immune-mediated fibro-inflam-matory disorders ， was proposed in 2003 ， defined in2010 ， and unified in 2012 . Classification criteria were developed in 2019 . IgG4-RD presents inflammation with dense lymphocytes， infiltration with IgG4-positive plasma cells， and marked fibrosis . Clinical manifestations of IgG4-RD vary， depending on the affected multiple organs . The diagnosis of IgG4-RD is challenging because of multior-gan involvement and heterogeneity， thus requiring thorough comprehensive whole-body evaluation  and differentiation from malignancies and other immune-related fibro-inflamma-tory disorders . Although IgG4-RD shows a favorable re-sponse to glucocorticoid (GC) treatment， relapse or refractori-ness to treatment are critical concerns of clinicians .\n\n【5】Here， we present the case of a 61-year-old woman with low back pain who was diagnosed with IgG4-RD with rare involve-ment of the thoracoabdominal aorta and retroperitoneum di-agnosed based on histopathological and radiological studies according to the 2019 classification criteria.

It usual-ly presents in paroxysms and about 67% occur in women . There are usually no identifiable provoking factors， but the use of stimulants and excessive activities have been implicated.\n\n【9】Case Report\n\n【10】A 36-year-old female with a past medical history of palpitations since her 20s (with no prior investigations) and depression on paroxetine， presented to the Emergency Department (ED) be-cause of worsening of persistent palpitations. Her symptoms had been ongoing for the past three months before she came to the ED. She was consuming caffeinated beverages during that time. Her palpitations improved but got worse again after consuming caffeine on the day of presentation. Her palpitations lasted about one hour but had resolved before she was seen. As described by the patient， it was associated with shortness of breath and mild left-sided chest pain， which also resolved before coming to the ED for evaluation. At presentation， vital signs and physical examination did not reveal any positive findings. Her laboratory findings were pertinent for hemoglo-bin of 11.8 g/dL， and an initial troponin I was 8.16 ng/mL ap-proximately seven hours after palpitations started with a peak of 10.50 ng/mL and a lowest level of 6.86 ng/mL at the time of discharge. Urine beta-human chorionic gonadotropin wasnegative for pregnancy and a urine drug screen was also neg-ative for phencyclidine， amphetamine， and cocaine. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)， C-reactive protein， and erythro-cyte sedimentation rate were essential within normal limits. An electrocardiogram  was not evident for acute cor-onary syndrome and a chest x-ray was normal. An echocardio-gram was unremarkable with an ejection fraction of 70%. She was hospitalized in the coronary care unit (CCU). Telemetry re-vealed no documented evidence of an arrhythmia while in the CCU. The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization， which revealed normal coronary arteries. Electrophysiology studies were performed. At baseline， the patient was in sinus rhythm：sinus cycle length was 820 milliseconds， AH interval was 78 mil-liseconds， HV was 46 milliseconds，QRS duration was 80 milli-seconds， and PRinterval was 140 milliseconds. Pacing from the high right atrium using the right atrial catheter was performed， which showed AV Wenckebach cycle lengths at 360 millisec-onds. Block was at the AV nodal level. There was evidence of slow pathway conduction. AVNRT was easily and reproducibly induced at any pacing cycle length. Programmed atrial stimu-lation showed AV node effective refractory period of 280 milli-seconds at drive cycle lengths of 600 milliseconds. The longest A2H2 was 362 milliseconds. AVNRT was reproducibly induced. Programmed ventricular stimulation showed concentric retro-grade atrial activation sequence with decremental conduction and no bypass tract. The ventricular atrial block cycle length was 310 milliseconds. Unfortunately， radiofrequency energy ablation was unsuccessful. The patient remained asymptom-atic after electrophysiology studies， and hence， a troponin was not done afterward. The patient was discharged on metoprololtartrate 25 mg twice daily and was instructed to have a cardi-ac magnetic resonance imaging as an outpatient， which dem-onstrated normal biventricular function with no late gadolini-um enhancement. She has remained symptom-free since her discharge at the time of writing this case report.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Troponin is a marker than can be found in cardiac muscles. It is often released into the bloodstream during myocardial in-jury. There are three forms of troponin-troponin C， troponinI and troponin T. They can be found in both cardiac and skele-tal muscles， but many laboratories can detect specific cardiac troponins， for example， troponin I (cTnl). When an injury oc-curs to the myocardium， proteins are released into the circula-tory system including troponin， creatine kinase， alanine trans-aminase， aspartate transaminase， and lactate dehydrogenase. cTnl can be detected as early as six hours post-injury and usu-ally peaks at 24 hours after the cardiac injury. It remains ele-vated after several days but in a declining manner. Many dis-eases can cause an elevation in cTnl，the commonest is acute myocardial infarction. Others include myocarditis， tachyar-rhythmia， cardiac traumas， pulmonary embolism and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. Severe and critical elevation of cTnl is usually found in myocardial infarction but with other causes often causing mild elevation. In a retrospective study conduct-ed in Australia， peaked cTnl was a strong indicator of coro-nary artery disease . In another article the peaked cTnl in patients with AVNRT was 0.89 ng/mL. Studies have shown that AVNRT is mainly associated with a mild increase of cTnl but there are no levels specific for AVNRT. In clinical practice，many physicians will not hesitate to perform a coronary an-giogram in a patient with cTnl more than 230 times above the normal upper limit with a presentation of palpitations associ-ated with shortness of breath and chest pain. The initial dif-ferential diagnosis was acute coronary syndrome because of the severe elevation of troponin level. Acute myocarditis was also considered but was less likely because the history and examination did not fully support this diagnosis. A tachyar-rhythmia was also considered， and it was deemed the culprit for her presentation and laboratory findings. A very high cTnl is often associated with significant myocardial injury； how-ever， the level of troponin seen in our patient without evi-dence of coronary artery disease， illicit drug use， pregnancy or other structural heart disease makes our case unusual and unique. Furthermore， we are not aware of any published case report demonstrating such a level of troponin in AVNRT with-out structural heart disease.\n\n【13】Conclusions\n\n【14】It has been documented that tachyarrhythmias cause a mild increase of troponin levels and severe elevations of tropo-nin are often attributed to myocardial infarction. Physicians should be aware that troponin may increase to over 200 times above the normal limit in a patient with AVNRT and normal coronary arteries.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

We also emphasize the comprehensive clinical， radiographic， and histopathologic evaluation， and immunohistochemical staining of this patient.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】We conclude that it is important to consider malignancy alternations in the epithelial component of AFS， along with that of the mesenchymal component， to provide a proper diagnosis and treatment of recurrent AF.\n\n【5】MeSH Keywords： Ameloblastoma ·Odontoma\n\n【6】Ameloblastic fibrosarcoma (AFS) or ameloblastic sarcoma is a rare odontogenic neoplasm with preponderance for the pre-molar and molar regions of the mandible . Ameloblastic fibrosarcoma is regarded as the malignant counterpart of am-eloblastic fibroma (AF). According to the 2005 World Health Organization (WHO) classification， it belongs to the group of odontogenic sarcomas， along with ameloblastic fibrodentino-sarcoma (which demonstrates focal evidence of dentinoid de-posits) and ameloblastic fibroodontosarcoma (with dentinoid and enameloid deposits) . Ameloblastic fibrosarcoma has been reported to either arise as a de-novo lesion of the jaws or from malignant transformation of a pre-existing ameloblas-tic fibroma . Histopathological features of AFS are benign epithelial nests resembling that of ameloblastic fibroma and a malignant ectomesenchymal component that shows the fea-ture of a sarcoma . Ameloblastic fibrosarcoma is usually regarded as a low-to-intermediate-grade malignancy. It has lo-cally aggressive behavior and a high recurrence rate， but rare-ly metastasizes .\n\n【7】In this report， we describe a rare case of AFS with epitheli-al dysplasia， along with a brief review of its clinicopatholog-ical features. It is an uncommon finding because features of malignancy in AFS are restricted to the mesenchymal compo-nent， while the epithelial component remains rather subdued in most patients with AFS .\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】In the winter of 2013， a 26-year-old man was referred to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) of Thaleghani Hospital of Shahid Beheshti Univers ity of Medical Sciences for the evaluation of a continuous pain and pares-thesia on the left side of his face. It was of 2-month duration. but did not interfere with chewing or cause difficulty with opening his mouth.\n\n【10】He was referred to this center with similar complaints 3 years ago. The patient had an enucleation done via an intra-oral ap-proach with the preservation of the inferior dental nerve along with the inferior and posterior mandibular borders， and the bi-opsy revealed ameloblastic fibroma .\n\n【11】He is a carpenter by profession and his medical history was uneventful. Generalexamination was normal.On extra-oral ex-amination， the face was asymmetrical because of a medium-sized swelling extending from the left angle of the mandible to the first molar area of the mandible . Palpation re-vealed a tender， bony， hard tumor without a fistula， in the left region of the mandible. Intraorally， a 5x5-cm swelling extendingfrom the retromolar pad to the first molar area was seen. The mucosal surface was intact. No other intra-or extra-oral signs were observed .\n\n【12】The submandibular lymph node on the same side was enlarged， firm， tender， and mobile， measuring 1x1 cm. Hypoesthesia along the distribution of the alveolar nerve was observed. No oth-er significant findings were seen， and laboratory values were in normal ranges. No evidence of regional or distant metas-tasis was observed.\n\n【13】On radiographic examination， a well-defined multilocular ra-diolucency was seen extending from the second premolar to near the coronoid process of the mandible. The outline ofthemandibular canal in anterior region was poorly defined. Also， root resorption of first and second premolar was seen . Computerized tomography revealed an expansive and homo-geneously radiolucent mass occupying the posterior part of the left mandible， with perforation of the lingual cortical plate. Calcifications were not observed within the lesion .\n\n【14】A primary pre-operative differential diagnosis of recurrent am-eloblastic fibroma， aggressive central giant cell granuloma， am-eloblastic fibrosarcoma， and ameloblastic carcinoma was made.\n\n【15】Pre-operative aspiration biopsy of this swelling containing some blood was free of malignant cells. The patient underwent left hemimandibulectomy after 1 week of presentation at this cen-ter. The mandibular condyle was preserved and the positionof the mandible was stabilized by a reconstruction plate. All surgical resection margins were tumor-free. Finally， a surgical specimen was submitted for histopathological examination.\n\n【16】The excised specimen consisted of the left half of the body and ramus of the mandible， with the tumor mass measuring7.0x5.0x5.0 cm，which perforated the inferior mandibular bor-der and lingual cortical bone. The tumor was firm， tan-brown， and had a fleshy appearance .\n\n【17】Microscopic examination of the hematoxylin-eosin stained slides revealed a neoplastic tissue with cords and nests of epithelial cuboidal or columnar ameloblast-like cells with peripheral pal-isading. In some areas， epithelial components show pleomor-phism， hyperchromatism， and increased nuclear-to-cytoplas-mic ratio. The mesenchymal background was mostly composed of plump stellate-shaped and ovoid-to-spindle-shaped cells. Nuclear hyperchromatism， pleomorphism， and scattered mitot-ic figures were identified in some areas， as well as giant and bizarre cells. There were aso wide areas of necrosis .\n\n【18】Immunohistochemistry was done using the proliferation mark-er Ki-67， and pan-cytokeratin and vimentin was also used to confirm the epithelial component of the islands and the mes-enchymal stroma . Ameloblastic epithelium showed positive immunoreactivity for pan-cytokeratin and the spin-dle cell component was positive for vimentin. Furthermore， Ki-67 labeling index of the spindle cell component and epitheli-al component increased to 13.2% and 6.6%， respectively. Thisindicates a moderately low proliferative activity of AFS， unlike in a carcinosarcoma (because in ameloblastic carcinosarcoma both components are malignant and the Ki-67 marker for both components is above 10%). Finally， the tumor was diagnosed as“ameloblastic fibrosarcoma\" according to clinicopatholog-ic findings. The patient was regularly followed up. He did not have radiotherapy and remains disease-free 20 months after surgical intervention. The radiograph of this patient did not show radiolucent lesion after 2 weeks .\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】Ameloblastic fibrosarcoma (AFS) was first described by Heath in 1887 as a spindle cell sarcoma with epithelial cells resem-bling those of the enamel organ； it is a rare， malignant，odon-togenic tumor . However， 71 cases have been reported in the English literature so far. Most have occurred in the man-dible and in the third decade of life .\n\n【21】Ameloblastic fibrosarcoma occurs in a wide age range， from 3to 83 years (mean， 27.3 years). Patients with AFS are typically10 years older than those with AF . Ameloblastic fibrosar-comas occur about 1.5 times as often in males as in females. Bregni et al. reported a male-to-female ratio of 1.6：1.Our patient was 26 years old at presentation， similar to the mean age reported. According to cases reported， no significant dif-ference was observed in age and sex distribution between our case and those in the literature . Although either the max-illa or the mandible may be involved， AFS more frequently oc-curs in the mandible (79%) than the maxilla (21%) and most that were similar to our case were found in the posterior re-gion of the mandible . Clinical appearance and symptoms vary among the reported cases， but swelling and pain are the most common clinical findings， as in our patient. Involvement of the cervical or submandibular lymph node and hypoesthe-sia are uncommon findings . The tumor usually shows a destructive radiolucent pattern with ill-defined bor-ders suggestive of malignancy in panoramic radiographic and computerized tomography images in AFS . In our case， destructive behavior of the lesion was obvious in both con-ventional radiographs and computerized tomography images.\n\n【22】In approximately half of known cases， the most commonly pro-posed pathogenesis of AFS is transformation of an existing AF after surgical procedures. The mechanism of this transforma-tion is not completely understood . Muller et al. re-ported that 44% of AFS patients had a previous diagnosis of AF . Thus， serial sampling of the surgical specimen of AF is helpful for early diagnosis of AFS.\n\n【23】Definitive diagnosis of AFS is established based on histopath-ological evaluation of the mesenchymal components， which usually demonstrates various features of malignancy， includ-ing cellular atypia， hyperchromatic nuclei， bizarre pleomorphic cells， and mitotic figures. The epithelial component appears histopathologically benign， like ameloblastic fibroma， and does not demonstrate any cytologic atypia \n\n【24】Khalili and Amini Shakib reported a case of AFS in the left pos-terior region of the maxilla with benign-appearing epithelial islands and highly cellular mesenchymal tissue with pleomor-phism and scattered bizarre giant cells . The histological study of the present case revealed epithelial dysplasia in is-lands of odontogenic epithelium with pleomorphism， nucle-ar hyperchromatism， increased N/C ratio， and atypical mito-ses in highly cellular mesenchymal tissue with spindle-shaped cells showing marked pleomorphism and infrequent mitoses. Strands of odontogenic epithelium were composed of 2 lay-ers of cells that are columnar or cuboidal in shape， like AF.\n\n【25】In another study， by Yamamoto et al.， the presence of keratin in the columnar and polyhedral cells of the epithelial compo-nent and vimentin in the ectomesenchymal component was demonstrated，verifying the biphasic nature of this tumor . Williams et al. demonstrated a case of anaplastic ameloblas-tic fibrosarcoma arising in an ameloblastic fibroma with histo pathological findings including benign， interlacing and uniform， and epithelial islands within a bland spindle-cell background characteristic of AF \n\n【26】Sometimes it is may be difficult to differentiate AFS because it can be similar to low-grade tumors from ameloblastic fibro-ma to a carcinosarcoma that is a malignant mixed-type tumor similar in pattern to an AFS， but in which both the epithelial and the ectomesenchymal components show cytological fea-tures of malignancySeveral studies have suggested biomarkers associated with cell proliferation (Ki67， PCNA， and c-KIT) and apoptosis (BCL2) to overcome difficulties in the diagnosis of the tumor with low malignant potential in the mesenchymal component without considering clinical and radiographic findings .A high Ki-67 labeling index indicates a high proportion of prolif-erating cells in the malignant epithelial and the mesenchymal components； therefore， it may be useful in differentiating themalignancy of the epithelial portion of carcinosarcoma from that of AFS . In our case， Ki-67 labeling index rate showed x<10% in epithelial portion and x>10% in mesenchymal por-tion and the rate of Ki-67 marker for ameloblastic carcinoma was 48.7%  .We submit that our case is that of ameloblastic fibrosarcoma with epithelial dysplasia. This may explain the more aggressive behavior of the carcinosarcoma as opposed to the less aggressive fibrosarcoma in which the epithelial component is benign .\n\n【27】Once the diagnosis of ameloblastic fibrosarcoma has been con-firmed， radical surgical excision with a margin of normal tis-sue appears to be the treatment of choice. Curettage or local excision is usually followed by rapid local recurrence. Some investigators recommend adjuvant chemo-and/or radiother-apy， but others are uncertain about their benefits .\n\n【28】Ameloblastic fibrosarcoma is locally aggressive and infiltrates adjacent bone and soft tissues， but regional lymph node in-volvement or distant metastasis has been reported in a few cases . Documented metastasis has been reported only once in the literature . Recurrence rate is high in AFS； 25 (35%) of the 71 reported cases have had at least 1 re-currence during the follow-up period . Furthermore， it has caused death in 14 (19.7%) reported cases at between 3months and 19 years， usually because of uncontrollable locallyinvasive recurrences ， therefore， long-term follow-up would provide more information on survival and recurrence rates of this tumor.\n\n【29】Our patient underwent radical surgical resection with free mar-gins. He had no chemotherapy or radiotherapy.There is no ev-idence of recurrence or metastasis after 20 months.\n\n【30】Conclusions\n\n【31】We report a rare example of ameloblastic fibrosarcoma de-velopment in an ameloblastic fibroma patient 3 years after the primary excision， which manifested a different histologi-cal feature showing epithelial dysplasia. This histopathologic feature in our case is distinctly different from those previous-ly reported， and suggests that the benign odontogenic epithe-lium in AFS may progress to malignant transformation such as carcinosarcoma. We conclude that epithelial dysplasia in ameloblastic fibrosarcoma needs more attention and evalua-tion of both the epithelial and mesenchymal components in all odontogenic tumors.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Remnants of the patho-logical periodontal tissue can still be present after the extraction. Periodontal flap surgery contributes to achiev-ing a better regeneration process at the extraction site. This case report includes a unique unconventional ap-proach to periodontal therapy， not commonly reported in the literature.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 37-year-old man reported mobility and migration of the teeth in both jaws and was referred to the Periodontology Department of the University of Prishtina Dentistry School. The patient had no personal history of any cur-rent systemic condition or family history of similar gum conditions. After a clinical and radiographic evaluation(periodontal probing depth and gingival index)， most of the front teeth of both jaws were diagnosed with ter-minal stage periodontal disease (stage 4， grade C). Modified Widman flap periodontal surgery was conducted on the maxilla and mandible to extract most of the front teeth. The sites of tooth extraction underwent pro-found debridement to remove the pathological soft tissues and sharp bone extrusions.\n\n【4】The 4 postoperative follow-up visits at 1， 4， 8， and 10 weeks showed sufficient restitution of the wounds. He received temporary mobile prostheses for the areas with multiple extractions. After 10 weeks， he began treat-ment for a fixed prosthetic bridge. He had a satisfactory recovery and was followed up over 3 annual visits af-ter his surgery.\n\n【5】Conclusions： Multiple extractions can be considered as a treatment option for terminal stage periodontitis.\n\n【6】Keywords： Chronic Periodontitis · Surgical Flaps·Tooth Extraction\n\n【7】Tooth loss continues to be a major global health problem . Periodontitis is a disease (in addition to caries， orthodontic treat-ment， traumatic injuries， prosthetic indications， and tooth im-paction)  that eventually leads to the loss of teeth， especial-ly in later periods of life . Periodontitis was reported to be the second major cause for tooth extraction . The classifica-tion of periodontal diseases has been modified in several in-ternational workshops to accommodate up-to-date knowledge of a multitude of research with the more recent classification of 2017， grouping previous chronic and aggressive forms of periodontitis (1999 classification) under the single category of periodontitis . An innovative move in the latest revised clas-sification included a system of staging and grading for periodon-titis， with a possible future adaptation with new evidence .\n\n【8】The treatment plan for periodontal disease is complex and de-pends on many underlying local and systemic factors that can interfere with the outcomes. The plan primarily depends on the stage of the periodontal disease， while other factors (in-cluding diabetes， smoking， immunodeficient diseases， alco-hol abuse) can complicate the plans for improved outcomes. As there are no typical patterns of periodontal disease in the same patient， or even in the same jaw， the treatment plan is usually different for different areas of the mouth.\n\n【9】In the planning phase， an improvisation of techniques with fewer procedures to achieve optimal results can be considered. The combination of periodontal surgery executed simultane-ously with multiple extractions is not routine， as the extrac-tions are part of the basic treatment， while periodontal sur-gery is conducted at a later stage. Some conditions (including Down syndrome) require a team approach with conscious se dation for outpatients and in some cases， general anesthe-sia to facilitate conditions for multiple extractions  to pre vent the microbial burden arising from the periodontal foci.\n\n【10】A particularly severe form， periodontal disease of rapid de-struction (formerly known as aggressive periodontitis \\[AgP\\]) can affect individual teeth (localized) or groups of teeth (gen-eralized) and accelerate tooth loss . In a systematic review of treatment options for AgP， including multiple extractions， it was found that extraction at multiple sites was conducted during active or supportive periodontal treatment .\n\n【11】When examining the risk factors for tooth loss due to periodon-tal disease， authors have excluded cases of multiple extractions， since some teeth (lateral) are more susceptible to caries， and other teeth (front teeth) survive to a later stage when the peri-odontitis is more advanced or at the terminal stage . The treatment of generalized periodontitis is often compromised if the teeth at the terminal stage (currently classified as stage4， grade C) have gone through multiple nonsurgical extrac-tions . Therefore， a comprehensive periodontal treatment， including surgical treatment， can prevent tooth loss during the maintenance phase . The maintenance phase consists of all future appointments to detect and treat early recurrenc es of the disease. There is little information in the literature that describes multiple extractions during periodontal surgery.\n\n【12】Case Report\n\n【13】Our patient was a 37-year-old man who was a nonsmoker and had excessive mobility and migration of the front teeth of both jaws. He had no previous periodontal treatment and was re-ferred to the Periodontology Department of the University of Prishtina Dentistry School. His history showed that the mo-bility and migration of the front teeth had progressed in the last 12 months， with minor gum bleeding and swelling for the past 5 years. The patient had no personal history of any pres-ent systemic condition or family history of similar gum condi-tions. Therefore， no risk for any underlying complications was anticipated. The clinical  and radiographic  examination revealed that most of the front teeth of both jaws were at the terminal stage of periodontal disease (stage 4， grade C)， with an average periodontal pocket depth of 9 mm(normal gingival sulcus is up to 2 mm) and terminal mobili-ty. Given this poor prognostic evaluation， the solution was ex-traction of the incisors from both jaws. As the extent of the periodontitis involved >30% of his teeth， it was classified as generalized periodontal disease. The other affected regions(apart from the front teeth) were classified as stage 3， grade B periodontitis. No genetic or microbiological profile was per-formed before or after the treatment. The patient gave verbal informed consent for the treatment plan， which included modi-fied Widman flap periodontal surgery for the maxilla and man-dible after the basic therapy regimen (removal of hard and soft deposits on the teeth)， and the simultaneous extraction of the upper teeth (International Dental Federation numbers 11， 12，21， and 22) and lower teeth (International Dental Federation numbers 32， 31， 41， and 42) (American Dental Association teeth numbers 7， 8，9，10，23，24，25，and 26). No intraopera-tive regenerative procedure was planned. For the convenience of the patient， the sequence of the surgery was planned for both jaws on the same day. The maxillary teeth were extract-ed first and the mandibular teeth were extracted later in the same surgery. To prevent any concomitant bacteremia， a sin-gle dose of a commercially available combination of 1 g amox-icillin and clavulanic acid was administered orally 1 hour be-fore surgery. During the surgical procedure， after completion of the planned extraction of teeth， the extraction sites went through a profound debridement to remove the pathological soft tissues and sharp bone extrusions. The regions of the oth-er teeth with periodontitis (not to be extracted) were treatedwith a standard periodontal surgical approach using modified Widman flap periodontal surgery to access the deep periodon-tal pockets to remove all the pathological changes from the root surface， bone defects， and gingiva . After the surgery， he was prescribed amoxycillin 500 mg 3 times/day for infection prevention， while instructions for an oral hygiene regimen were given for the day after the surgery. The patient had an uneventful recovery.\n\n【14】The postsurgical follow-ups were at 1， 4 ， 8 ， and 10 weeks. He was given a temporary mobile prosthesis(upon his request) during the recovery phase of the surgi-cal sites for public appearances and social occasions. The ex-traction sites showed restitution of the adjacent tissues with normalization of the color and texture of the resilient muco-sa. The patient’s recovery period was delayed by a month due to moderate negligence of oral hygiene measures ， after which he continued the treatment for fixed prosthetic appliances. The repeated instructions for better oral hygiene were necessary at this phase of recovery. The follow-up visits consisted of an annual visit to the Clinical Center for mainte-nance for at least 3 years after the surgery， and his fixed pros-thetic appliances were in satisfactory condition.\n\n【15】The review board of the Dentistry School approved this case report for publication. The patient gave informed consent for the Dentistry School to use the data collected from this case for publication in conferences and journals.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】The treatment options for periodontal diseases have been widely discussed in many scientific circles； however， the si-multaneous combination of treatments that are otherwiseconducted at different stages of periodontal therapy are rare-ly found in the literature.\n\n【18】A review of the literature regarding surgical therapy for peri-odontitis identified a dearth of systematically designed ran-domized controlled trials； the existing trials have been criti-cized for their high risk of bias. Nevertheless， this review has acknowledged some innovative steps to enhance the out-comes of surgical treatment， including piezosurgery， video-scope-assisted minimally invasive surgery， regenerative pro-cedures aided with biologic agents， and promising research using stem cells .\n\n【19】The patient in the current case report was diagnosed with rap-idly advancing periodontitis and some areas of partially ter-minal stages of periodontitis. Given his persistence to accel-erate treatment procedures to improve his appearance due to his public profile， he underwent unconventional， improvised periodontal surgical treatment with simultaneous multiple ex-tractions， which seemed to be a satisfactory solution for him. However， it was not necessarily an improvement on the basic standards of periodontal treatment.\n\n【20】Periodontitis is one of the major causes of tooth loss， espe-cially in the later periods of life. A study in Kuwait found that periodontitis is the second major cause of tooth loss (37.4%)， while caries is the first cause， accounting for 43.7% of tooth loss. When compared within the age groups， periodontitis was the major cause of tooth loss for patients >40 years old .\n\n【21】The extraction of teeth compromised by terminal periodontitis is usually planned at the initial phase of basic therapy， while teeth with better periodontal prognosis undergo either non-surgical or surgical procedures to eliminate periodontal pock-ets. The gravest form of periodontal disease that has rapid onset and progression is AgP. While the tooth loss associat-ed with AgP has been reported to be lower with active peri-odontal therapy ， it shows an increased tooth loss dur-ing supportive (maintenance) therapy .\n\n【22】Conclusions\n\n【23】It is possible that this case report is the first of its kind， can-not be compared to a similar case， and will serve as a prec-edent for further investigations of periodontal surgery plan-ning， including multiple extractions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Aims： To study the spectrum of morphologic changes in ovarian neoplasms in a tertiary care setup in North India. Settings and Design： Retrospective Materials and Methods： This is a three-year study of 66 cases of ovarian neoplasms submitted for histopathological examination， received as part of surgically resected hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or as an ovarian mass/oophorectomy specimen. The study was conducted from March 2017 to February 2020 in the Department of Pathology at T.S. Misra Medical College and Hospital， Amausi， Lucknow. The relevant data were retrieved from the Department record file， including the slides for review. Result： The 66 ovarian neoplasms studied showed54(81.8%) benign tumours， 11 malignant (16.66%) and 1(1.5%) borderline tumour. The surface epithelial tumours were the highest， 53 (80.3%) in number， followed by 11(16.6%) Germ cell tumours and 2 (3%) Sex- cord-stromal tumours. The age range of presentation was between 15-65 years. Conclusion： The study will provide an overview of the morphological patterns and frequency of various ovarian neoplasms present in and around the Amausi region of Lucknow， which will further facilitate management and introduce other research and screening tools for early diagnosis of this neoplasm.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Ovarian neoplasms， Surface Epithelial Tumors， Germ cell tumours， Sex-cord stromal tumours.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Globally， the ovarian cancer incidence in India is the second highest. Very frequently， patients are hospitalized and undergo surgery for ovarian tumours， and they are the most frequently encountered lesions in gynecologic practice.\n\n【4】The common non-neoplastic cystic lesions of the ovary in-clude follicular cysts， corpus luteal cysts， endometriotic cysts and haemorrhagic cysts， which may mimic grossly and clinically with neoplasms of the ovary.\n\n【5】It is the young females who usually present with benign tu-mours of the ovary whereas malignant tumours are frequently present in elderly females. Among the gynaecological malig-nancies， the worst prognosis is that of ovarian cancers. There is a low 5-year survival rate as the disease is usually diagnosed late.560% of ovarian neoplasms having germ cell origin are seen in children and adolescents.\n\n【6】Materials and Methods\n\n【7】This is a retrospective study of 66 cases of ovarian neoplasms submitted for histopathological examination in the Department of Pathology， T S Misra Medical College and Hospital，Lucknow. The study was conducted over three years， from March 2017to February 2020. The slides were retrieved from filing， and a diagnosis was made based on WHO classification.\n\n【8】Results\n\n【9】A total of 287 specimens of ovary were received in the three years， out of which 245 were hysterectomy specimens and 42were oophorectomy specimens. Of the total ovarian specimens received， 66 were neoplasms on histopathological examination. Out of 66 ovarian tumours， 54(81.8%) were benign， 11(16.66%) were malignant， and one (1.5%) was a borderline tumour.\n\n【10】The age of presentation ranged between 15 and 65 yrs. A maximum of 55(83.83%) ovarian tumours were noted in the21-50 age group.\n\n【11】The largest tumour encountered in the present study mea-sured 23.0 X12.0 X2.0 cm， a Serous cystadenoma.\n\n【12】There were 53 tumours of epithelial origin， i.e. 80.3% of all ovarian tumours. Among these surface epithelial tumours， Serous cystadenoma was the most common benign tumour com-prising 66.03% of all epithelial tumours， followed by 11.3% cases of Mucinous cystadenoma. Fig 1 shows a serous cystadenoma， a cyst lined by a single layer of tall columnar epithelium with bland nuclear features and stroma containing spindly fibroblas-tic cells. The mucinous cystadenoma in Fig 2 shows multiple cysts lined by bland mucinous epithelium.\n\n【13】Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma was the most common malig-nant tumour， constituting 11.3% of cases. Fig 3 and Fig 4 show tall columnar epithelium in a confluent glandular configuration， with cells showing variable nuclear atypia.\n\n【14】The Borderline Mucinous adenocarcinoma in Fig 5 shows the stratification of the mucinous epithelial layer with mild nuclear atypia.\n\n【15】The next common malignant tumour was Serous papillary carcinoma which was 9.4% of all epithelial tumours. Solid masses of cuboidal to columnar epithelium with significant nu-clear atypia are seen with papillary branching in Fig 6 and were given as Serous Cystadenocarcinoma.\n\n【16】Tumours of Germ cell origin were 11 and comprised only Ma-ture cystic teratomas， which were 16.6% of all ovarian tumours. Fig 7 shows a mature cystic teratoma with a thyroid follicularcomponent. Fig 8 shows a cystic component of dermoid cyst enclosing keratin material.\n\n【17】2 (3%) Sex cord-stromal tumours were seen in the present study. Fig 9 shows a sclerosing stromal tumour displaying dilated and branched vasculature. Fig 10 shows alternating hypocellular and hypercellular areas.\n\n【18】Table 1 Distribution of ovarian tumors according to age.\n\n| Age range  | Total-66  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 0-10  | 门  |\n| 11-20  | 05  |\n| 21-30  | 13  |\n| 31-40  | 24  |\n| 41-50  | 18  |\n| 51-60  | 05  |\n| 61-70  | 01  |\n\n【20】Table 2 Distribution of ovarian tumors according to type.\n\n【21】Type of ovarian tumour\n\n【22】Total 66mours were mostly globular， cystic and smooth-walled.

We present a rare genetic disorder that was misdiagnosed as anorexia nervosa.

She reported being underweight her entire life， and had a body mass index of 12 kg/m² for a year prior to admission. She report-ed a long-standing intolerance to enteral feeding and had not gained weight when prescribed parenteral nu-trition. She reported a desire to gain weight and denied any body dysmorphia. Upon nutritional rehabilitation， the patient was found to have extreme insulin resistance， with serum glucose values exceeding 400 mg/dl， and multiple neurologic findings that were incongruent with the medical complications of anorexia nervosa. These metabolic abnormalities， with her physical examination findings， allowed for a diagnosis of mitochon-drial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy\n\n【4】Conclusions： This case report highlights the clinical presentation of mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopa-thy including the newly described extreme insulin resistance， and showcases the importance of avoiding con-firmation bias and working through differential diagnoses that are inconsistent with a clinical presentation to arrive at the correct diagnosis.\n\n【5】Keywords： Anorexia Nervosa· Thymidine Phosphorylase· Insulin Resistance·Hyperglycemia·Visceral Myopathy Familial External OphthalmoplegiaAnorexia nervosa is a complex psychiatric disorder with a high mortality often due to medical complications from prolonged starvation. It has a strong association with mood and anxiety disorders， personality disorders， self-harm， and substance abuse. Anorexia nervosa， however， can also mimic many other disor-ders because of its covert nature and myriad medical compli-cations， which affect nearly every organ system . We report a case of a young adult previously diagnosed with psychogen-ic anorexia who was noted to have significant hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia upon refeeding， which ultimately led to a diagnosis of mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal enceph-alomyopathy (MNGIE)， an extremely rare mitochondrial disor-der. This is the first description of the metabolic abnormalities encountered during refeeding of an individual with MNGIE.\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】A 24-year-old woman was admitted to an inpatient unit for re-duced oral intake and weight loss， which was presumed sec-ondary to an eating disorder. She had been underweight her entire life， and at the age of 6 years， she began to experience abdominal pain， postprandial emesis， and intermittent diar-rhea alternating with severe constipation， leading to further weight loss. At the age of 15， she was diagnosed with type 2diabetes mellitus. At age 18， she was diagnosed with psycho-genic anorexia. She was intolerant of enteral feeding owing to abdominal pain， and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syn-drome had been diagnosed based on duodenal compression on a computerized tomography scan. At age 22， her weight had reached a nadir of 27.7 kg， with reports of daily emesis， and she was subsequently started on total parenteral nutrition(TPN). At age 23， she underwent a duodenojejunostomy for the SMA syndrome and， shortly after that， underwent a surgical jejunostomy owing to a lack of improvement in her gastroin-testinal symptoms. However， she continued to have poor tol-erance to enteral feedings， requiring numerous feeding tube(re)placements， and eventually became solely dependent on TPN， although her weight remained low at 29.5 to 30.8 kg. She reportedly stopped seeing her gastroenterologist and dieti-cian because of her ongoing frustration regarding her gastro-intestinal symptoms and began self-managing her TPN. Three months before this current admission， she awoke one morn-ing with acute onset of left-sided hearing loss； on further au-diology workup， she was noted to have bilateral hearing loss with negative magnetic resonance imaging (MRl) of the brain. Completion of oral steroids resulted in no improvement.\n\n【8】On the day of admission， the physical examination showed se-vere cachexia， with a height of 160 cm and a weight of 30.6kg(body mass index of 11.95 kg/m?； 58.1% of ideal body weight).\n\n【9】Hertemperature was 37.2℃， heart rate was 93 beats per min， respiratory rate was 16 breaths per min， and O， saturation was99% on room air. Her cognition， speech， and language were within normal limits， although she frequently exhibited a lais-sez-faire attitude during portions of the interview. She was also noted to have limited extraocular movements in all directions， ptosis， diminished sensation to light touch in the bilateral low-er extremities， reduced strength in the bilateral proximal and distal lower extremities，and diffuse sarcopenia. Cardiovascular and respiratory examinations were unremarkable. An abdominal examination revealed multiple healed scars from her prior sur-gical interventions and diffuse guarding upon manual palpation that was absent when applying abdominal pressure with the stethoscope. Laboratory results on admission revealed sodium136 mmol/L， potassium 3.2 mmol/L， chloride 94 mmol/L， CO，34 mmol/L， BUN 9 mg/dL， creatinine 0.66 mg/dL， AST 82 U/L， ALT 49 U/L， glucose 76 mg/dL， WBC 7.54 k/UL， hemoglobin10.4 g/dL (normal MCV at 89.6 fL)， platelets 283 k/UL， hemo-globin A. c of 5.2%， and TSH 0.89 ulU/mL Additional laborato-ry results obtained during admission included a negative au-toimmune workup， normal C3/C4， negative Hl testing， and elevated vitamin B12 (1069 pg/mL).\n\n【10】The patient tearfully endorsed a desire to gain weight， deny-ing any drive for thinness or body dysmorphia at the time of her current admission. She in fact stated“I love food.I love to cook. I hate the way I look\". As mentioned above， she was diagnosed with psychogenic anorexia at age 18. More re-cently， she was diagnosed with avoidant restrictive food in-take disorder at an outside hospital only 1 month ago. She had grown up in a family with limited emotional expressivity， and she described her life as “traumatic\"， with an abusive re-lationship during 2013-2014， the witness of her grandmoth-er's near-fataltrauma in 2014， and the loss of her brother to a motor vehicle accident in 2018. She reported that owing to her physical issues， she had been unable to process “the grief and trauma\". She was recently married， and she was a col-lege graduate with a degree in primary education but was cur-rently unemployed due to her medical status. She reported a history of daily medical marijuana use for 1 month as an ap-petite stimulant (over a year ago) and denied any other sub-stance use. She was formally diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder in 2015 and anxiety and depression in 2017. She was on treatment for depression with duloxetine 30 mg daily， lorazepam 1 mg daily as needed for panic attacks， and trazodone 50 mg nightly for insomnia. She had not tried any other psychotropic medications. She scored moderate for de-pression and anxiety on recent Patient Health Questionnaire9 and General Anxiety Disorder 7 questionnaire， respective-ly. She denied suicidal ideation， suicide attempts， self-harm， or prior psychiatric hospitalizations. Genetic loading was lim-ited to undiagnosed anxiety and depression in her paternal and maternal grandmothers.\n\n【11】Her prescribed nutritional plan at admission consisted of 1800kcal (1200 kcal by mouth and 600 kcal via TPN). However， due to oral kcal refusal， emesis， and significant gastric dilatation re-quiring nasogastric suction noted on day 7， she was convert-ed entirely to TPN by the end of the first week of admission. She endorsed daily abdominal pain and frequently requested intravenous hydromorphone for pain control during this time. In addition to her home regimen of duloxetine， and trazodo-ne， she was also prescribed olanzapine to reduce gastric sen-sitivity along with symptoms of anxiety and depression， with a maximum dose of 10 mg achieved during admission. Workup for this abdominal discomfort included an upper gastrointesti-nal series， which revealed a partial proximal jejunal narrowing， and a follow-up upper endoscopy revealed evidence of reflux esophagitis， normal mucosa on biopsy from the second part of the duodenum， a sharp external bend in the proximal jejunum， and evidence of dysmotility with decreased gastric peristalsis. Nasojejunal tube placement was attempted as a means to pro-vide enteral feeding， although fluoroscopy was unable to ad-vance the tube past the jejunal kink. Given the flow of contrast through the jejunal narrowing， enteral feedings were restarted at a deliberate rate of 20 mL/h； however， the patient continued to remain intolerant of enteral feeding owing to reported pain levels up to a maximum of 10 out of 10， again necessitating the use of TPN as her sole source of nutrition. However， upon advancing the diet to 2600 kcal via TPN， the patient developed hyperglycemia， with point of care testing frequently document-ing glucose values greater than 400 mg/dL， which required high doses of subcutaneous insulin along with up to 400 units of fast-acting insulin added to the TPN daily. She also developed significant hypertriglyceridemia (>1100 mg/dL； normal <150mg/dL) while receiving this nutritional plan (160 g amino ac-ids daily g/kg based on her current body weight\\]， 451 gdex-trose daily， and 413 mL of intralipid daily)， all limiting the abil-ity to successfully restore weight in this patient.\n\n【12】Given her constellation of findings of gastrointestinal dysfunc-tion， cachexia， ophthalmoplegia， ptosis， peripheral neuropa-thy， early onset hearing loss， and significant insulin resistance with TPN infusion， investigation for mitochondrial neurogas-trointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) was pursued. Brain MRI revealed symmetric non-enhancing white matter chang-es consistent with leukoencephalomyopathy. Further， testing for MNGIE was accomplished by the measurement of plasma and urine thymidine and 2'-deoxyuridine concentrations (12.64umol/L \\[reference range <0.25 umol/l\\]and 23.18 umol/L \\[ref-erence range <0.25 umol/l\\]， respectively) and measurement of thymidine phosphorylase activity (4 nmol/mg/h \\[reference range 414-1020 nmol/mg/h\\]). Thymidine phosphorylase (TYMP) gene sequencing also detected pathogenic variants. The pa-tient was then transferred to a specialized center to consid-er experimental treatment for MNGIE and was subsequent-ly lost to follow-up.\n\n【13】Anorexia nervosa has historically been called “the great pre-tender” because of the associated systemic medical com-plications  and covert behaviors associated with this ill-ness. Indeed， the patient’s reported gastrointestinal symptoms， comorbid mental health diagnoses， lack of weight gain when self-managing her nutrition， and laissez-faire attitude during the initial assessment were consistent with a potential eating disorder diagnosis. Per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual，5h edition ， to diagnose an individual with anorexia ner-vosa requires：\n\n【14】1\\. Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements，lead-ing to significantly low body weight.\n\n【15】2\\. Intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat， or persis-tent behavior that interferes with weight gain， even though at a significantly low weight.\n\n【16】3\\. Disturbance in the way in which one's body weight or shape is experienced， undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation， or persistent lack of recognition of the se-riousness of the current low body weight.\n\n【17】However， this patient adamantly denied any body dysmorphia or food avoidance for the sole purpose of weight loss； there-fore， other diagnoses were considered.\n\n【18】A diagnosis of avoidant restrictive food intake disorder was also considered and requires：\n\n【19】1\\. An eating or feeding disturbance manifested by persistent failure to meet appropriate nutritional and/or energy needs associated with 1 (or more) of the following：a. Significant weight loss (or failure to achieve expected weight gain or faltering growth in children)；b. Significant nutritional deficiency；\n\n【20】c. Dependence on enteral feeding or oral nutritional supplements；\n\n【21】d. Marked interference with psychosocial functioning.\n\n【22】2\\. The disturbance is not better explained by lack of available food or by an associated culturally sanctioned practice.\n\n【23】3\\. The eating disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervoSa.\n\n【24】4\\. The eating disturbance is not attributable to a concurrent medical condition or not better explained by another men-tal disorder .\n\n【25】However， given the extreme insulin resistance， which was in-consistent with the complications of malnutrition， along with her other constellation of symptoms， it was first necessary to rule out concurrent medical conditions.\n\n【26】Our patient's constellation of gastrointestinal symptoms was consistent with the physiologic changes and functional gas-trointestinal diseases that can develop with malnutrition .\n\n【27】However， the neurologic findings in this case could not sole-ly be attributed to her malnutrition. Lagophthalmos is con-sidered a complication of malnutrition due to orbital fat pad atrophy ； however， ptosis and ophthalmoplegia are not as-sociated with malnutrition and were instead initially attribut-ed to her type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosis. Similarly， malnu-trition can be associated with a compression neuropathy due to loss of subcutaneous tissue as well as a type 2 muscle fiber atrophy ， but her bilateral lower extremity sensory deficits were inconsistent with such and were also initially attributed to her type 2 diabetes diagnosis. However， her normal hemo-globin A.c level and extreme insulin resistance also suggest-ed consideration of other diagnoses.\n\n【28】Hypoglycemia is frequently documented in those with more severe malnutrition during the early stages of refeeding before replenishing glycogen stores . In starvation， glucagon in-creases to promote liver gluconeogenesis， lipolysis in adipose tissue， fatty acid oxidation， and ketone body production ， with a decrease in the metabolic rate of 30% to 50% . Reintroducing nutrition to a starved patient can result in a rapid decline of gluconeogenesis and initiation of anabolic process-es， leading to an intracellular shift of glucose， and potentially increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. Insulin levels are elevat-ed at the beginning of the refeeding process and can repre-sent an early stage of insulin resistance， also potentially pre-disposing to hypoglycemia . Interestingly， in patients with anorexia nervosa， gastrointestinal hormones such as gluca-gon-like peptide and amylin， which normally stimulate insulin release from pancreatic beta cells， are low， which may be an adaptive response to starvation to prevent further hypoglyce-mia . However， a significant rise in energy expenditure de velops as early as 1 week into refeeding . Indeed，the ex-treme hyperglycemia and significant insulin resistance at such a low body weight suggested an inherited metabolic disease.\n\n【29】MNGIE has historically been misdiagnosed as an eating dis-order ， although there is a single case report wherein a patient was described as having both MNGIE and anorexia nervosa . MNGIE is a rare multiorgan autosomal recessive mitochondrial disorder associated with mutations of the TYMP gene， with roughly 200 cases diagnosed . The absence of the TYMP gene allows for the accumulation of thymidine and deoxyuridine， thereby leading to mitochondrial dysfunction through the impairment of mitochondrial DNA function . It is known that mitochondrial dysfunction， which ultimately af-fects oxidative phosphorylation， is involved in the pathogen-esis of insulin resistance， which manifests as hyperglycemia and increased plasma fatty acid levels . However， this insulin resistance has not previously been described in MNGIE.\n\n【30】Like other mitochondrial disorders， MNGIE presents with vary-ing degrees of disease severity and heterogeneity of symp-toms owing to the heteroplasmy of mitochondrial DNA in tis-sues . Even though symptom onset frequently occurs in childhood， most patients with MNGIE are diagnosed in the second decade of life or later owing to progressive symp-toms . Most commonly， patients have chronic gastroin-testinal symptoms and are often admitted with severe malnu-trition from rapid and unexplained weight loss ， given that muscle is so commonly affected by mitochondrial dys-function due to its high energy requirements and dependence on oxidative phosphorylation . Early satiety， nausea， gas-troesophageal reflux， postprandial emesis， episodic abdomi-nal pain and/or distension， and diarrhea/constipation are the constellation of gastrointestinal symptoms seen in MNGIE from a progressive loss of gastrointestinal motility due to muscle dysfunction .\n\n【31】Patients with MNGIE have progressive multiorgan involvement and also present with ophthalmoplegia， peripheral neuropa-thy，and leukoencephalomyopathy . In the case reports where MNGIE was initially misdiagnosed as anorexia nervosa， all the patients had at least 1 of these clinical findings in ad-dition to the prominent gastrointestinal concerns and weight loss .Ophthalmoplegia， or weakness of the extraocu-lar muscles， with ptosis is a common finding in MNGIE and is often unnoticed by patients as it is not accompanied by dip-lopia. The demyelinating sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy is symmetrical and distal， diagnosed on electromyography， and often with prominent lower extremity involvement. It is associated with a lack of deep tendon reflexes， paresthesia in a stocking-glove distribution， foot drop， and clawed hand. Leukoencephalomyopathy is diagnosed on brain MRl and is usually asymptomatic. Patients can also present with early-onset sensorineural hearing loss and liver involvement with fatty liver or cirrhosis .\n\n【32】Conclusions\n\n【33】MNGIE， a rare mitochondrial disorder， presents with a constel-lation of nonspecific findings， including weight loss， gastroin-testinal symptoms，and several neurologic abnormalities. This case report highlights the clinical presentation of this illness， including the newly described extreme insulin resistance. It showcases the importance of avoiding confirmation bias and working through differential diagnoses inconsistent with a clin-ical presentation to arrive at the correct diagnosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Ovarian， vaginal， and cervical metastasis has been described in the literature. Uterine corpus and， particularly， endometrial in-volvement are exceedingly rare. As the incidence of lung cancer is rising in the female population， metastatic uterine involvement by lung cancer is also being reported in the medical literature. Here， we report two cases of endometrial metastasis from primary lung adenocarcinoma.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】The first case is a 55-year-old woman diagnosed with stage Ill lung adenocarcinoma who received initial treat-ment with sequential chemotherapy and radiotherapy， which resulted in complete response to treatment. However， patient was found to have recurrence soon after completion of initial treatment. Biopsy of a hyper-metabolic lesion confirmed endometrial metastasis. The second case is a 51-year-old woman who presented with stage lV lung adenocarcinoma with metastasis to the uterus. EGFR mutation analysis of the lung mass and endometrial biopsy revealed epidermal growth factor receptor L858R mutation in exon 21. She had a pos-itive response to EGFR-directed treatment of all areas of disease， including the uterus.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】Uterine metastasis from lung adenocarcinoma is uncommon and difficult to differentiate from primary uterine cancer. The possibility of lung cancer metastasis should be considered in patients who have adenocarcinoma on biopsy of uterine lesions.\n\n【6】MeSH Keywords： Carcinoma， Non-Small-Cell Lung·Urogenital Neoplasms · Uterine NeoplasmsThe incidence of lung cancer is increasing in women . Regional lymph nodes， liver， adrenal gland， bones， and brain are considered the most frequent sites of metastasis from lung adenocarcinoma. Metastatic involvement to female genital tract by lung cancer is rare. Ovarian and vaginal involvement are the most common gynecological metastatic sites for both extra-genital and genital primary malignancies . The ovaries are relatively common sites of metastas is from primary lung adenocarcinoma . Endometrial metastasis is extremely rare for primary lung malignancies. To the best of our knowledge， there have been only 2 reports of primary lung adenocarci-noma with metastatic involvement of the endometrium 4，5J. Here， we report 2 cases of histopathologically proven prima-ry lung adenocarcinoma metastasizing to the endometrium.\n\n【7】Case Reports\n\n【8】Case report 1\n\n【9】A 55-year-old woman initially noticed a swelling on the right side of her neck. The needle biopsy result was consistent withadenocarcinoma of the lung. Tumor cells were positive for cy-tokeratin 7， TTF-1， and Napsin， and negative for cytokeratin 20， cytokeratin 5/6， and CDX2. A staging CT scan confirmed stageⅢB disease. The patient was started on chemotherapy with Cisplatin and Etoposide， with a plan for sequential radiation treatment. Chemotherapy was later switched to Carboplatin， Abraxane， and Bevacizumab. Chemotherapy resulted in a par-tial response after 2 cycles. The patient completed radiation treatment to her chest and received 2 more cycles of consoli-dation chemotherapy afterwards. A restaging scan after com-pletion of treatment showed a complete radiologic response by PET/CT scan.\n\n【10】A PET CT scan was performed 5 months after treatment， due to development of new pulmonary symptoms， which showed hypermetabolic activity in the left hilum and in the endometri-um . Because it was assumed that the endometrial le-sion was likely a second primary lesion the， patient underwent mediastinal lymphadenectomy for local disease recurrence. Pathology results confirmed disease relapse in left hilar lymph nodes， consistent with the initial diagnosis. An endometrial bi-opsy was also performed， which showed adenocarcinoma mor-phologically identical to the left hilar lymph node biopsy. Tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3)， cytokeratin-7，and\n\n【11】TTF-1， and focally positive for vimentin. Stains were negative for cytokeratin-20， estrogen receptors， and progesterone re-ceptors . These results are consistent with metasta-sis of lung adenocarcinoma to the endometrium.\n\n【12】Case report 2\n\n【13】A 51-vear-old Taiwanese woman who had never smoked was diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung. Biopsy of lung lesion revealed positive expression of Napsin A， TTF-1， cytokeratin 7， and MOC-31， and was negative for cytokeratin5/6， WT-1， estrogen and progesterone receptors， CDX-2， and cytokeratin 20， consistent with adenocarcinoma of lung origin. Testing for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) revealed L858R mutation in exon 21. Her initial PET scan showed lung lesions， as well as a uterine mass that was presumed to be a uterine fibroid； however， this was not biopsied at the time of initial diagnosis. She was initially started on erlotinib， which is an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKl)， but after about 10days she developed a severe skin rash； erlotinib was discontin-ued and she was treated with gefitinib. A repeat PET scan after4 months showed a partial response to therapy. Of note， the uterine mass also decreased in size. The patient developed 2liver lesions almost 7 months after treatment， for which she re-ceived CyberKnife radiotherapy， as well as receiving CyberKnife radiotherapy to her primary lung lesion. She was then restart-ed on erlotinib at a lower dose. She subsequently had disease progression resulting in pleural effusion and pericarditis and was switched to afatinib almost 18 months after the diagnosis.\n\n【14】Twenty-two months after her initial diagnosis， she developed abdominal pain and heavy vaginal bleeding. A CT abdomen revealed enlarged right uterine mass， right hydronephrosis， and hydroureter. An endometrial biopsy was performed， which showed adenocarcinoma positive for TTF-1， negative for ER and PR， and morphologically similar to her primary lung cancer. Tissue was sent for EGFR mutation analysis， which showed the same L858R mutation， but also the presence of the EGFR TKI resistance mutation， T790M. This confirmed me-tastasis of EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma to the uterus with subsequent development of T790M mutation. This rep-resents another rare case of uterine endometrial metastasis from primary adenocarcinoma of the lung.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Metastatic involvement of the female genital tract from lung adenocarcinoma is rare， and we are aware of only 2 prior pub-lished case reports of uterine metastasis. Other uncommon sites of metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer are the pan-creas， spleen， and placenta， which can sometimes be challeng-ing to diagnose .\n\n【17】Pathologically， endometrial metastatic lesions can be difficult to differentiate from primary uterine cancers in some circum-stances. TTF-1 nuclear expression is the most highly sensitive and specific marker to differentiate primary adenocarcinoma of lung from adenocarcinomas of other sites . Between 74%and 92% cases of lung adenocarcinoma exhibit TTF-1 nucle-ar expression .However， TTF-1 has also been reported in 6% to 32% of endometrial adenocarcinoma . Almost100% of patients diagnosed with endometrial adenocarcino-ma and 90% of patients with lung adenocarcinoma are CK-7-positive and CK-20-negative ； thus， a combination of expres-sion of TTF-1+， CK-7+， and CK-20-immunophenotype is highly suggestive of primary adenocarcinoma of the lung (specificity100%) . The immunohistochemical profiles in the 2 cases we describe here are indicative of metastatic lung adenocar-cinoma rather than primary uterine cancer. Between 35% and90% of endometrial adenocarcinomas also express estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR， respectively).\n\n【18】Though ER/PR positivity can also be observed in lung adeno-carcinomas ， the absence of ER and PR expression in our 2cases also support the diagnosis of lung cancer metastas is to the endometrium. The finding of the classic L858R EGFR mu-tation observed in the second case with the most common EGFR TKI resistance mutation， T790M， are also highly sugges-tive of lung metastasis. EGFR mutations are rarely observed in endometrial cancers， but none of those reported wee similar to mutations commonly seen in lung cancer .\n\n【19】These 2 cases highlight the importance of recognizing hema-togenous metastasis， as it could impact care. Our first patient died of complications following mediastinal lymphadenectomy， which was only performed under the assumption of local re-currence rather than hematogenous metastasis. Although the patient described in case report 2 remains alive， her treatment course might have been altered， as she most likely would not have received local therapy for liver lesions under the describedcircumstances. Moreover， if recognized earlier as a metastat-ic lesion， it could have been addressed with local treatment early on for palliation.\n\n【20】Conclusions\n\n【21】Uterine metastasis from lung adenocarcinoma can present a diagnostic dilemma. The possibility of lung cancer metastasis should be considered in patients found to have adenocarci-noma on biopsy of a uterine mass. Appropriate immunohisto-chemical staining should be used， considering the possibility of adenocarcinoma of lung origin in appropriate clinical settings.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

She did not have any risk fac-tors associated with ischemic colitis. Further evaluation revealed that she was taking phentermine for six months for weight reduction. She was gradually improved and discharged from the hospi-tal and did not resume her weight loss medication.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】Phentermine may be causative of ischemic colitis and further research is needed to establish an epidemiologic link and the underlying mechanism.\n\n【6】key words： phentermine·ischemic colitis · sympathomimetic\n\n【7】BACKGROUND\n\n【8】Phentermine is an appetite suppressant used for short-term weight loss. It is an amphetamine-derived sympathomimet-ic that stimulates norepinephrine release in the hypothala-mus to suppress appetite . Side effects include primary pulmonary hypertension， cardiac valvular disease， hyper-tension and stroke. Phentermine together with other diet medications such as fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine has been associated with fatal pulmonary hypertension. \n\n【9】However， there is only one case report of phentermine asso-ciated ischemic colitis in the medical literature .We de-scribe a case of a young female with extensive and severe ischemic colitis associated with phentermine with no oth-er identifiable risk factors leading to gangrenous colon ne-cessitating colectomy.\n\n【10】CASE REPORT\n\n【11】A 37-year-old female with history of obesity came to the emergency room with moderate crampy lower abdomi-nal pain for one day with two episodes of diarrhea with te-nesmus that contained maroon colored blood mixed with stools. She had no associated relieving or aggravating fac-tor. She denied nausea， vomiting， fever or chills preced-ing the illness. There was no prior history of tumors， adhe-sions， hernias， diverticulitis， inflammatory bowel disease， thrombosis， trauma， coronary artery disease， congestive heart failure or arrhythmia. She denied smoking， alcohol abuse， use of oral contraceptives， illicit drug use or use of cathartics in the past. Family history was unremarkable for inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer. There was no history of vigorous exercise or fasting. She denied current regular medication use except for acetaminophen for ac-casional headaches\n\n【12】On physical examination， she was hemodynamically stable with normal vital signs\n\n【13】Abdominal examination was remarkable for moderate ten-derness over lower abdomen with no guarding， rigidity or rebound. There was no appreciable organomegaly on pal-pation. Bowel sound was hyperactive. Digital rectal exami-nation showed maroon red blood with empty rectal vault. Otherwise，examination was unremarkable.\n\n【14】Initial laboratory data showed normal hemogram and chem-istry. Computed tomography (CT) abdomen and pelvis was significant for pan colitis with bowel wall thickening involv-ing the colon .\n\n【15】We admitted her to medical floor and started her on intra-venous (Ⅳ) hydration and empirical antibiotics with met-ronidazole and levofloxacin. Work up for stool fecal leuko-cytes， cultures， giardia antigen， cryptosporidium antigen and clostridium difficle toxin A and B was negative.\n\n【16】During the hospital course， she continued to have severe and progressive abdominal pain but she remained hemo-dynamically stable. Repeated CT scan of abdomen and pel-vis showed worsening colitis. Laboratory investigations were negative for serum antinuclear antibodies (ANA)， antineu-trophillic cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and C-reactiveprotein. Hypercoaguable workup for factor V Leiden， ho-mocysteine， prothrombin gene mutation， and anticardio-lipin antibody and lupus anticeagulant were also negative. Surgical consult was obtained and she underwent explor-atory laparotomy and total colectomy with ileoproctostomy because of the gangrenous bowel. Pathology results showed acute ischemic colitis .\n\n【17】Further investigation revealed that she had been using Phentermine 37.5 mg for six months and had lost twenty pounds of weight during that period. She improved grad-ually after colectomy and discharged home. She remained stable and did not resume her weight loss medication.\n\n【18】DISCUSSION\n\n【19】Ischemic colitis is the most common form of ischemic injury to the gastrointestinal tract representing more than half of the cases with gastrointestinal ischemia . Ischemic coli-tis frequently accurs in the elderly and debilitated patient population. Conditions that can predispose to ischemic coli-tis include mesenteric artery emboli， thrombosis， or trauma leading to occlusive vascular disease and impaired colonic perfusion. Hypo-perfusion states due to congestive heartfailure， transient hypotension in the perioperative period or strenuous physical activities and shock due to a variety of causes such as hypovolemia or sepsis can cause ischemic colitis. Mechanical colonic obstruction due to tumors，ad-hesions， volvuli， hernias， diverticulitis or prolapse may also infrequently cause ischemic colitis. Another important but sometimes overlooked cause of ischemic colitis is use of both prescription and illicit drugs. Pharmacologically in-duced ischemia has been implicated in many cases of isch-emic colitis .\n\n【20】Comay D et al. described first case of ischemic colitis assaci-ated with the use of phentermine alone ， but there were other risk factors associated with possible development of ischemic colitis such as unexplained arrhythmia and lack of hypercoaguable workup were not clarified. Patient in our case does not have such predisposing conditions.\n\n【21】Phentermine can cause ischemic colitis by release of nor-epinephrine from nerve terminal that in turn leads to vaso-constriction and mesenteric ischemia. In our patient the de-velopment of ischemic colitis after phentermine use could be a delayed reaction of the drug.\n\n【22】Although medication use for weight loss diminished follow-ing the withdrawal of fen-phen， their use remain above those in the early 1990s. Phentermine has been one of the most common weight loss medication . It can also be obtained over the internet but the exact prevalence of such practiceis unknown. Physicians who prescribe phentermine should carefully monitor for signs of ischemia， and discontinue the medication if any gastrointestinal or systemic symptoms de-velep especially in patients with predisposing factors.\n\n【23】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【24】Drug reactions need to be considered as a cause of isch-emic colitis. Phentermine may be associated with the devel-opment of ischemic colitis and further research is needed to establish this association and the exact pathophysiology. Clinicians should be aware of such severe reactions， because this recognition can prevent significant adverse outcomes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

We report a case of successful re-administration of nivolumab in metastatic renal cell carcinoma after discontinuation due to immune-related adverse events.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】Laparoscopic nephrectomy was performed on a 52-year-old man diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma pT1b-NOM0. After surgery， left adrenal and lung metastases appeared. Nivolumab was administered as a sixth-line therapy and he achieved a partial response， but interstitial pneumonia occurred. He was diagnosed with grade2 immune-related adverse events， and nivolumab treatment was discontinued. Interstitial pneumonia was well controlled by steroids. He maintained a partial response for a long time， and the lung metastases disappeared7 months after discontinuation. However， bilateral lung metastases reappeared 10 months after the discontin-uation. We decided to re-administer nivolumab， while carefully monitoring the patient and fully explaining the risk of recurrence of immune-related adverse events. After 5 cycles of re-administration， computed tomogra-phy revealed a reduction in metastases without re-activation of interstitial pneumonia. He experienced a grade1 fever the day after re-administration， but continued nivolumab therapy without other adverse events. After7 cycles of re-administration， the lung metastases increased， and nivolumab treatment was terminated. Two months later， a grade 2 interstitial pneumonia recurred， but improved rapidly with oral steroids.\n\n【4】Conclusions： For patients who have discontinued immune checkpoint inhibitors due to immune-related adverse events， re-challenge of immune checkpoint inhibitors may be an option after explaining the risk of relapse of immune-re-lated adverse events.\n\n【5】Keywords： Carcinoma， Renal Cell· Lung Diseases， Interstitial ·Nivolumab\n\n【6】The CheckMate-025 trial demonstrated the significance of nivolumab over everolimus for the treatment of advanced re-nal cell carcinoma (RCC) previously treated with antiangio genic agents. The response rate for nivolumab was 23%， and the median duration of response was 18.2 months， indicating good results， but 9.6% had to discontinue nivolumab due to immune-related adverse events (irAEs) . In the case of se-rious irAEs， permanent discontinuation of the immune check-point inhibitors (ICls) is required； otherwise， the same ICl is often re-administered after the irAE has resolved. As there are no randomized trials examining ICl re-administration and there are only a few retrospective reports， the safety and efficacy of ICl re-administration after discontinuation due to irAEs remain unclear. We report the case of a patient with metastatic RCC who had a second response to re-administration of nivolumab after discontinuation due to interstitial pneumonia.\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】A 52-year-old man underwent laparoscopic radical left nephrec-tomy for a 6.5-cm left renal mass. The pathological results in-dicated clear cell RCC， Fuhrman grade 4， and pT1bN0M0.The patient had no predisposing factors for RCC. Five years later， a left adrenal metastasis appeared.\n\n【9】Since he did not wish to undergo adrenalectomy， he was treat-ed with various targeted therapy agents (sorafenib， sunitinib， everolimus， axitinib，and pazopanib). However， lung metasta-ses appeared， and the left adrenal metastasis developed 12years after the surgery . Nivolumab therapy was initiated as the sixth-line therapy.\n\n【10】Nivolumab (3mg/kg) was administered every 2 weeks. After 3cycles of administration， he presented with cough. Computed tomography (CT) revealed reticular interstitial shadows in both lungs on the right predominant side . He was diag-nosed with grade 2 interstitial pneumonia， and nivolumab ther-apy was discontinued. He was treated with steroidal pulse ther-apy， and the interstitial pneumonia improved quickly. After the pulse therapy， he was administered a down-titrated oral pred-nisolone dose. Steroid therapy was terminated after 14 months. At the time of diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia， both lung and adrenal metastases were reduced， as documented by CT. The patient achieved  and maintained partial response(PR) after nivolumab discontinuation； lung metastases disap-peared 7 months after discontinuation . Ten months after nivolumab discontinuation， bilateral lung metastases reap-peared， but the patient was not treated because of the risk of irAEs. After 23 months of nivolumab discontinuation， the lung metastases progressed， and his cough worsened .\n\n【11】We decided to re-challenge with nivolumab and explained the risk of recurrence of interstitial pneumonia in the patient. After re-administration of nivolumab， the patient underwent a chest X-ray and had consultations with a respiratory phy-sician every 2 weeks. The day after re-administration， he de veloped a grade 1 fever that subsided spontaneously without antibiotics. He continued nivolumab therapy without any oth-er adverse events. After 5 cycles of re-administration， CT re-vealed a reduction in all metastases ， and the pa-tient achieved PR again.\n\n【12】However， after 7 cycles of treatment， the lung metastases increased again， and nivolumab treatment was terminated. Two months after nivolumab discontinuation， a chest X-ray revealed consolidation. Subsequent CT showed a recurrence of grade 2 interstitial pneumonia with a contralat-eral left predominance . We administered down-ti-trated oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg) that rapidly improved the interstitial pneumonia. Nine months after nivolumab discon-tinuation， there was no further evidence of interstitial pneu-monia， and the patient was placed under observation and pro-vided with the best supportive care.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】In the CheckMate-025 study，interstitial pneumonia was observed in 5.2% of the patients， of which 71.4% had grades 1-2， 28.6%had grades 3-4， and none had grade 5 . According to the guide-lines， re-administration of ICls after grade 2 irAEs is allowed if the patient has improved to grade 1 or lower， but re-administration is not recommended for patients with grade 3 or higher .\n\n【15】Recently， there have been retrospective reports of re-adminis-tration of ICls for metastatic RCC. Abou Alaiwi et al analyzed45 cases of metastatic RCC that were re-administered with ICIs after discontinuation due to irAEs and reported a response to ICI re-treatment in 23.1% of patients who did not respond to the initial ICl treatment 5. IrAE recurrences were observed in50% of cases， but no grade 4 and 5 irAEs were observed， and there was no correlation between the grades of the first irAE and the second irAE. Ravi et al reported 69 patients who re-ceived at least 2 separate lines of ICl for RCC . PR was ob-tained in 37.5% of patients who were re-administered with other ICls after discontinuation due to irAEs， which was higher than the 37% overall response rate of the initial ICI treatment. Patients who developed irAEs on the initial ICI treatment had a significantly higher risk of developing irAEs with ICl re-chal-lenge than patients who did not (41%vs 20%). However， this rate was low compared to the 71% rate of developing irAEs with the initial ICI treatment. Grade 3 or higher irAEs were ob-served in 26% of patients treated with the initial ICl and in16% of patients with ICl re-treatment.\n\n【16】The reasons for the low rate of irAEs after ICl re-administra-tion include the possibility that irAE recurrence beyond the observation period may have been missed， and that the use of steroids or immunosuppressive agents during ICl re-ad-ministration may have affected irAE recurrence. In patients with melanoma， it has been reported that the recurrence rate of irAEs decreased after ICl re-treatment after anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) monotherapy， and that the history of anti-CTLA-4 treatment did not affect the recurrence rate of a grade 3 or higher irAEs with anti-programmed cell death 1 antibodies re-treatment . The mechanism of irAE recurrence is not yet understood， although differences in the mechanism of action of ICIs may contribute to a lower rate of irAE recurrence in the re-administration of different ICIs， as re-ported for melanoma by Ravi et al .\n\n【17】In other carcinomas， factors involved in the effect of ICl re-chal-lenge and irAE recurrences have been reported. Santini reported that patients who did not respond to the initial ICl treatmentbefore irAEs showed improvement in progression-free surviv-al and overall survival after ICl re-challenge . He further re ported that the factors contributing to irAE recurrence were initial irAEs requiring hospitalization and  PR or com-plete response after the first ICl administration. Simonaggio also reported a shorter time to onset of the first irAE in pa-tients with irAE recurrence than those with no recurrence (9vs 15 weeks； P=0.04)\n\n【18】In this case， the patient had a durable response after interrup-tion of ICl treatment but then progressed and was re-treat-ed with the same ICl， resulting in another response. There are few reports on the efficacy of re-challenging with the same ICl when patients progress after a durable response， as in this case. Reports of durable response in other carcinomas showed that many cases progressed within 2 years， and about 20% of patients responded to the same ICI .\n\n【19】These data suggest that an additional response and overall survival prolongation may be achieved with ICI re-challenge. Although there was no significant worsening of the grade or incidence of irAEs with ICl re-treatment compared with the initial ICI treatment， caution is required because there is no established follow-up method for early detection of irAE re-currence and there are no randomized data on the safety and efficacy of ICl re-challenge.\n\n【20】Conclusions\n\n【21】ICI re-challenge after irAE can be an option after patients are fully informed of the risk of irAE relapse. It is important to re-challenge ICIs cautiously in collaboration with other specialists.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Remission in his symptoms eventually was achieved with low-dose Cymbalta and a 6-week course of ciprofloxacin. He was not treated with an alpha blocker， corticosteroids， or pelvic floor therapy. In these cases，treatment with a nonsteroidal anti-inflamma-tory drug (NSAID) can provide pain relief， if needed， as well as anti-inflammatory benefits， but further studies of this ap-proach are required.\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】A 65-year-old man presented to the clinic with a 6-week his-tory of tenesmus. During the previous month， he had devel-oped sharp， stabbing rectal pain， which progressed to include perineal pain without testicular or penile pain. The pain was worse when he sat. He reported no dysuria， urinary urgency， urinary frequency， reduction in urinary stream， or hematuria.\n\n【9】The patient's medical history included Rai stage 0 chron-ic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)， hyperuricemia， major depres-sive disorder， social anxiety disorder， hyperlipidemia， hyper-tension， and obesity， with a body mass index of 40.76 kgm². His medications included allopurinol (100 mg daily)， aspirin(81 mg daily)， clonazepam (3 mg at bedtime) and Olmesartan-hydrochlorothiazide (40-mg/12.5-mg daily).\n\n【10】On physical examination， there were no palpable rectal mass-es and the patient's stool guaiac test was negative. On digi-tal rectal examination (DRE)， his prostate felt normal. His PSAlevel was 0.43 ng/mL A diagnostic colonoscopy showed small non-bleeding internal hemorrhoids. A rectal polyp resected on colonoscopy and was found to be hyperplastic. Biopsies of the terminal ileum， rectum， and the ascending and descending co-lon were all negative for colitis， dysplasia， and malignancy.The patient reported some improvement in rectal pain with over-the-counter Aleve， but was advised against continued use of this medication by a gastroenterologist. A urologist recom-mended Bactrim DS， 1 tablet twice daily for 6 weeks， for sus-pected chronic prostatitis. However， the patient discontinued the Bactrim DS after 3 weeks because of worsening of tenes-mus. There was also no improvement in his symptoms with trials of Bentyl and nortriptyline.\n\n【11】Over the next 6 months， the patient presented at least 12times to Emergency Rooms (ERs) in at least 3 health systems because of persistent and worsening tenesmus，constipation， and rectal pain. During that time， computed tomography (CT) with contrast and an MRI with and without contrast of his ab-domen and pelvis were unremarkable. The patient's constipa-tion was temporarily relieved in the ER with either Dulcolax suppositories or soap enemas， as needed. He was prescribed various medications prescribed for pain relief， including hydro-codone-acetaminophen as needed， lidocaine patches， Tylenol with codeine， gabapentin，oxycodone-acetaminophen， and hy-dromorphone. From the onset of his symptoms， the patient's weight unintentionally decreased from 300.6 lb to 215.8 lb over a 1-year period， which was ascribed to his fear of recurrent suppositories and enemas for constipation relief. The symp-toms were so severe that the patient attempted suicide by tak-ing an overdose of the hydromorphone and required stabiliza-tion on the inpatient psychiatric unit for 3 days.\n\n【12】An MRI of the patient’s lumbar spine showed a right paracen-tral disc protrusion at the L5-S1 level， which displaced the tra-versing right S1 nerve root within the right lateral recess， as well as advanced degenerative endplate changes and degen-erative endplate edema at the right aspect of the L2-L3 inter-space. There was no high-grade spinal canal narrowing and the sacroiliac joints were unremarkable. The patient subse-quently underwent an L5-51 laminectomy with microdiscec-tomy. Unfortunately， the procedure did not relieve his tenes-mus， constipation， or rectal pain. He was then referred to a tertiary health care system for further evaluation.\n\n【13】At the tertiary center， a repeat MRl of the patient's pelvis with and without contrast was unremarkable， including no abnor-malities along the pudendal nerves. High-resolution anorectal manometry showed a rectal evacuation disorder/pelvic floor disorder with decreased anal relaxation and abnormal rectal balloon expulsion (>60 seconds). A repeat MRI of the lumbar spine without contrast showed interval postsurgical changes on the right at the L5-51 level with recurrent right paracentraldisc protrusion contacting the right S1 nerve root. An elec-tromyogram and nerve conduction study (EMG-NCS) showed mild chronic L5 lumbar radiculopathy in both lower extremi-ties (asymptomatic) with no findings of pudendal neuropathy.\n\n【14】Because the patient had a sensation of incomplete emptying after urination， complex uroflowmetry was performed， which showed a residual volume of 389 mL after urination of 96 mL. On physical examination of his non-tender prostate by a urolo-gist， significant firmness was noted on the left side versus the right. The patient's PSA level was normal at 2.4 ng/mL. An MRI of his prostate with and without contrast showed a Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data Stem (PI-RAD) lesion involving the left peripheral zone of the prostate with diffuse enhance-ment and low signal throughout the gland. The prostate vol-ume was 33 cc. There were also findings suspicious for extra-capsular extension and neurovascular bundle invasion without suspicious bone lesions. Suspicious positive lymph nodes were seen， including an 8-mm left common iliac node， bilateral ob-turator nodes (1.1 cm on the left and 1.0 cm on the right)， and distal external iliac lymph nodes.\n\n【15】On pathology， periodic acid-Schiff diastase staining of the prostate biopsy specimens was negative. All 13 biopsy spec-imens from the left PI-RAD 5 prostatic lesion showed acute and chronic inflammatory changes (from mild to severe)， with prominent xanthogranulomatous features without evidence of necrosis .\n\n【16】Special stains (Gram， Grocott's Methenamine Silver， and ac-id-fast bacilli) were all negative， and antibodies against CD20and CD3 showed lymphocytic infiltrates， predominantly of CD3-positive T lymphocytes， with a minor population of CD20-positive B lymphocytes. CT-guided biopsy of an external iliac lymph node was consistent with the patient's history of CLL， with antibodies positive against CD20， CD5， and LEF1 antigens. The external iliac lymph node specimen also showed no growth on fungal culture， or on aerobic or anerobic bacterial cultures.\n\n【17】Because the patient had worsening depression and anxiety that his prostatic lesion and adjacent lymphadenopathy was prostatic adenocarcinoma， he was started on Cymbalta (30mg daily). The dosage could not be titrated because he expe-rienced fatigue as an adverse effect. Based on the patient's prostate biopsy results， he was prescribed ciprofloxacin (500mg twice daily for 6 weeks) for treatment of xanthogranulo-matous prostatitis and tamsulosin (0.4 mg daily) for manage-ment of mild benign prostatic hyperplasia on cystoscopy. The patient completed the ciprofloxacin as prescribed but never started the tamsulosin. For neurogenic bladder， he was ad-vised to self-catheterize 3 to 4 times daily as needed. He also was advised to complete pelvic floor therapy， which he never started. For chronic constipation， the patient was advised to take MiraLax daily， senna-docusate (8.6 to 50 mg， 1 to 2 tabs every other day)， and enemas as needed.\n\n【18】The patient reported improvement in all of his symptoms af-ter starting Cymbalta and the course of ciprofloxacin， with normalization of urination and discontinuation of catheteriza-tion， resolution of rectal and perineal pain， and normalization of bowel movements with only MiraLax daily. For fear that his symptoms would recur after completing ciprofloxacin，the pa-tient started 1 tablet daily of over-the-counter Aleve “for the inflammation” involved with xanthogranulomatous prostatitis. One year after his symptoms resolved， the patient's PSA level was 1.26 ng/mL. He declined a DRE on follow up.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】Granulomatous inflammation is classified as nonspecific or idiopathic， infective， iatrogenic， xanthogranulomatous， mala-coplakia， or associated with systemic granulomatous disease and allergy . Of the various forms of inflammation of the prostate， the nonspecific type is the most common， and granulomatous is rare. Xanthogranulomatous inflammation in-volving the kidneys and gallbladder is common . However， xanthogranulomatous prostatitis is rare， with no more than 10to 15 cases reported to date . The exact cause of xantho-granulomatous inflammation is unknown. However， an asso-ciation with hyperlipidemia has been reported .\n\n【21】On pathology， xanthogranulomatous prostatitis typically ap-pears as an accumulation of inflammatory cells， such as lym-phocytes， plasma cells， polymorphs， and eosinophils with a large number of foamy macrophages or histiocytes blended with oth-er inflammatory cells . On multiparametric MRI (mpMRl)， find-ings suggestive of xanthogranulomatous prostatitis can include diffuse changes involving 50% or more of the prostate with infiltration of periprostatic fat or extracapsular extension . Patient age at presentation can range from the 20s onward； the average age is in the early 60s .The presentation ismost often of lower urinary tract symptoms or symptoms of a lower UTI， including possible urethral discharge. Prostatic ab-scesses and rectovesical fistulas have been associated with xanthogranulomatous prostatitis . On physical examina-tion， the prostate is usually hard and nodular . The PSA lev-el is typically elevated， as high as 150 ng/mL .Imaging such as transrectal ultrasound and MRI cannot distinguish be-tween xanthogranulomatous prostatitis and primary prostatic malignancy . The diagnosis of xanthogranulomatous pros-tatitis can only be made definitively by pathological examina-tion .Theorized potential infectious causes of xanthogranu-lomatous prostatitis include types of fungi， parasites， viruses，\n\n【22】Escherichia coli， Treponema pallidum， and Mycobacterium tu-\n\n【23】berculosis . Conservative management is recommend-ed for xanthogranulomatous prostatitis， including use of alpha blockers and corticosteroids. The inflammation is thought to be self-limiting and to resolve gradually over time . Surgical options such as transurethral or open prostatectomy are re-served for patients who have severe symptoms or in whom conservative management has failed.\n\n【24】Our patient's age approximates the average age at presen-tation of xanthogranulomatous prostatitis， and the mpM-Rl of his prostate gland included diffuse prostatic enhance-ment and extracapsular extension and neurovascular bundle invasion. He also had a history of mixed hyperlipidemia (high total cholesterol， high triglycerides， and high low-density li-poprotein)， which was untreated after he reported diarrhea and lightheadedness with a brief trial of rosuvastatin (5 mg at bedtime). However， the present case is unique， in that the patient's initial symptoms were tenesmus， constipation， and rectal and perineal pain (symptoms of pelvic floor disorder)， and they preceded the expected urinary symptoms (retention， reduced urinary stream) by at least 1 year. His PSA level also was within normal limits throughout， although there was a5-fold increase (from 0.43 ng/mL to 2.4 ng/mL) within 1 year. Although tamsulosin was prescribed， the patient did not take it. After over 1 year of symptoms， the patient reported notic-ing improvement in tenesmus， constipation， and urinary re-tention after beginning the 6-week course of ciprofloxacin. In a case of xanthogranulomatous prostatitis in Morocco， a4-week course of ciprofloxacin resulted in a significant reduc-tion in a patient's PSA level (from 43.97 ng/mL to 7.27 ng/mL) and a reduction in his prostate volume (from 51 g to 31 g) . Cymbalta was selected in this patient for its potential pain benefits. Separate from the ciprofloxacin therapy， it is likely that his rectal and perineal pain improved， in part， because of the treatment with Cymbalta， because it concurrently ad-dressed his mood and anxiety problems. Our patient also par-tially attributed the remission of his symptoms to taking a dai-ly tablet of over-the-counter Aleve. In the present case， Aleve also provided some temporarily relief of the patient's rectal and perineal pain at the onset of symptoms， likely due to itsanti-inflammatory properties. However， the role of NSAIDs in xanthogranulomatous prostatitis is undefined. No corticoste-roids were prescribed to treat our patient.\n\n【25】During the year when the patient in the present case had symptoms， lumbosacral dysfunction was investigated and ad-dressed surgically， with no improvement in somatic symptoms. An EMG-NCS 3 months after the surgery showed no electro-physiological abnormalities that would explain his tenesmus， constipation，rectal and perineal pain， or the urinary symptoms. Medical evaluation， including workup and treatments， did not identify any alternate cause or result in relief of the patient's symptoms， except the eventual diagnosis and treatment of xanthogranulomatous prostatitis. Before the onset of symp-toms， the patient's bowel movements were regular and with-out straining， and he had not had any traumatic injury to his pelvis or pelvic surgery. Although it was believed that the pa-tient's symptoms would be self-limiting over time， they were persistent and atypical， and beyond the capability of current technology for early detection.\n\n【26】A left-sided PI-RAD 5 lesion， such as was seen on the patient's MRI， often leads to xanthogranulomatous prostatitis being mis-diagnosed as adenocarcinoma of the prostate. In the present case， the suspicious lymph nodes in the iliac area reinforced the suspicion of adenocarcinoma. Because imaging is unable to show features that definitively distinguish xanthogranulo-matous prostatitis from prostatic adenocarcinoma，histopath-ological examination is crucial for diagnostic clarification. In the present case， the patient's enlarged lymph nodes were re-lated to his history of CLL based on histopathology.\n\n【27】There are no documented cases of xanthogranulomatous prostatitis in individuals with a history of malignancy， includ-ing leukemia. The antibody testing of the patient's prostate gland specimens argued against any involvement of his CLL in relation to xanthogranulomatous prostatitis. Although the special stains ruled out any infectious contributions， the pos-itive response from ciprofloxacin is likely a result of its action in reducing the inflammatory process.\n\n【28】Conclusions\n\n【29】Xanthogranulomatous inflammation is commonly seen in the kidney and gallbladder and rarely found in the prostate. The present case report was of an atypical presentation of xantho-granulomatous prostatitis， which started with symptoms of pel-vic floor disorder (tenesmus， constipation， and rectal and per-ineal pain) that preceded urinary symptoms (retention， weak stream) by at least 1 year. In contrast to documented cases of xanthogranulomatous prostatitis， the patient’s PSA level remained within normal limits， although it increased 5-foldincrease within 1 year. His pain symptoms appeared to have resolved as a result of the benefits of Cymbalta (30 mg daily)， which was prescribed for management of his mood and anx-iety disorders. The patient's tenesmus， constipation， reduced urinary stream， and urinary retention improved after a 6-week course of ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily) and without con-current treatment with an alpha blocker， corticosteroids， or pelvic floor therapy. Treatment with a an NSAID can provide pain relief for patients with xanthogranulomatous prostatitis， if needed， as well as anti-inflammatory benefits， but further studies of this approach are required.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It was called“chromophil renal cell carcino ma” in the Mainz classification and has also been called“tu-bulopapillary carcinoma\" .\n\n【2】In this report， we describe a 20-year-old African American fe male with metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma who pre-sented with a single episode of hemoptysis and high blood pressure， with no family history of cancer. This is a rare pre-sentation of an uncommon disease.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】A 20-year-old African American woman with no significant past medical history arrived at the ER with a history of mild non-productive cough for 2-3 weeks and 1 episode of hemoptysis on the admission day. History was negative for weight loss， night sweats， fever， enlarged glands or recent travel. Reviews of respiratory， cardiac， and abdominal symptoms were unre-markable. Hematologic review revealed a history of mild iron-deficiency anemia secondary to menorrhagia. There was no ev-idence of pathological bleeding. The only significant finding on physical examination was a persistently elevated blood pressure of 160/107 with no significant difference when measured on the opposite arm. Abdomina. examination was unremarkable. A chest X-ray revealed left peri-hilar opacification with medi-al displacement of the gastric bubble， raising concerns about splenomegaly . A follow-up chest CT with intravenous contrast showed soft-tissue masses clustered in and around the left lung hilum and multiple similar masses in and around the carina and anterior mediastinum. An incidental finding of severe left hydronephrosis was made on the inferior slices of the chest CT. The incidental renal findings were confirmed on abdomen CT without contrast， in addition to an osteolytic le-sion on L3. Serum and 24-h urine catecholamines were sent but were negative. The patient was also sent for an abdomen and pelvis MRI with IV contrast， which revealed massive left hydronephrosis， multiple left renal cystic and solid lesions with-in the collecting system impairing renal perfusion and sever-al mildly enlarged left para-aortic lymph nodes and osteolytic lesions on L2 and L3 vertebral bodies . The largest of the multiple solid left renal lesions seen on MRI measured 6.5cm in diameter. CT-guided left renal biopsy was performed and the patient was discharged home. On follow-up， renal biopsy results confirmed papillary renal cell carcinoma. Biopsy stained positive for keratin AE1/AE3， CD 10， Vimentin， and PAX-2， and focally positive for cytokeratin 7 but negative for thyroid tran-scription factor 1 . Bronchoscopy with lavage revealed a left upper lobe friable bronchial lesion. Endobronchial biopsysamples and bronchopulmonary lavage both confirmed meta-static carcinoma with papillary features compatible with renal origin. The patient and her parents state that there is no his-tory of renal cell carcinoma or any other cancers in their family to the best of their knowledge. The patient has never smoked， urine toxicology was negative， and her BMI was within normal limits. Treatment was commenced with oral Sutent (sunitinib malate) 50-mg capsule daily， which is a multi-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The patient was re-admitted a few weeks later with severe lower back pain and right lower extremity weak-ness. Imaging studies could not rule out cord compression but did not show fracture . The patient received targeted radiotherapy to the L2/L3 vertebral area， physiotherapy and a back brace with subsequent significant clinical improvement. Urology determined surgery was not indicated based on tumorsize (multiple left renal lesions， the largest of which was 6.5 cm) and distant metastasis. The patient was referred to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) where she was enrolled in an interleukin-2-based therapy clinical trial.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】PRCC is an uncommon disease and metastasis is rare. It was estimated that there would be 64 770 newly diagnosed cases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in the United States in 2012 . On average， 10-15% of all cases of RCC are PRCC. By extrap-olation， in 2012 there would only be 6477 to 9715 new cases of PRCC in the United States in 2012 .\n\n【7】The median age at diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma in general is 64 years . Only 1.7% of all RCC between 2005 and 2009in the United States were diagnosed between the ages of 20to 34 years. A study on the incidence and long-term prognosis of PRCC in the United States involving 122 patients with PRCC also showed a median age of 63.46 years for PRCC . Our patient was diagnosed at the age of 20 years， which is more common in family clusters . However， our patient and her parents denied any history of cancer or unexplained medical deaths in their family， making this a highly unusual and rare presentation for a patient of this age.\n\n【8】PRCC may be sporadic or hereditary j. Hereditary forms are as-sociated with mutations in the c-met oncogene， which occurs in only 5-13% of sporadic cases ； 75% of sporadic cases of PRCC demonstrate trisomy 7 . However， the molecular and genet-ic features of PRCC are complex and usually involve several dif-ferent chromosomes and abnormalities， the most common of which are gains of chromosome 7 and/or 17 or loss of chromo-some Y . PRCC may also be classified based on histological features and gene expression profiles into type 1 or type 2 tu-mors . There is evidence that this particular classification has prognostic implications. One study found type 1 tumors have significantly better overall and disease-free survivals compared to type 2 . Microscopically， type1 PRCC demonstrates papillae covered by single-ayered， small cells with pale cytoplasm and round-to-ovoid nuclei， a pattern characteristic of hereditary PRCC but also seen in sporadic cases. In contrast， type 2 tumors show pseudostratified， large cells with relatively abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm； they are associated with poorer clinical outcomes .\n\n【9】Since the 1970s， PRCC has been associated with a more favor-able outcome and benign course . However， recent studies have shown a similar prognosis for PRCC and clear renal cell carcinoma (CRCC) when taking stage and grade into consid-eration . These discrepancies are likely due to the more ag gressive PRCC subtype 2. The tumor stage at diagnosis of sub-type 2 of PRCC is significantly higher than type 1 . Vascular invasion and distant metastasis by PRCC was reported in one study to be more common in type 2 than in type 1j. Our pa-tient presented with renal artery infiltration causing second-ary hypertension and metastasis to the lumbar spine， para-aortic lymph nodes， pulmonary hilar lymph nodes， and right bronchial system. As a whole， PRCC typically constitutes less than 10% of all metastatic renal cell carcinomas ， making this case even more unique. Mode of presentation of PRCC tends not to be significantly different from other RCCs. Male predominance occurs in both， but is 5：1 in PRCC compared to1.6：1.0 in RCC as a whole .Approximately 50% of RCC cas-es are incidental findings with minimal or no symptoms .\n\n【10】Immunotherapy with cytokines or tyrosine kinase inhibitors is the main treatment for metastatic PRCC and usually only achieves major responses in 10-20% of cases . Because metastatic PRCC is rare， it is difficult to find large clinical trialsaddressing treatment and outcome. A review of cases of meta-static PRCC performed by MSKCC covering 1985 to 2005 iden-tified only 38 cases . Of these 38 cases， 30 were treated at MSKCC with various systemic therapies including cyto-kines (such as interferon， interleukin-2， and combinations of these) and the multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor suni-tinib (which was used in our patient) . The average sur-vival time of this group was 8 months with a 3-year surviv-al rate of 7% .\n\n【11】Conclusions\n\n【12】We presented a rare case of a 20-year-old African American fe male with hemoptysis and high blood pressure leading to the finding of metastatic PRCC. PRCC rarely occurs in the second decade of life and even then， most such early cases occur in family clusters. PRCC also has a relatively benign course， ac-counting for less than 10% of all metastatic renal cell carcino-mas， again making this case a unique presentation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Small cell neuroen-docrine carcinoma (SCNEC) is an extremely rare pathological type of endometrial carcinoma. Case Presentation： A 65years old post-menopausal lady presented with vaginal bleeding. Baseline imaging showed soft tissue lesion of uterine origin with unusual findings， and biopsy showed neuroendocrine features. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed metastatic disease， and she underwent chemotherapy which had interestingly excellent response. Conclusion：Despite being rare and aggressive， neuroendocrine tumours must be considered as a differential possibility on imaging. Specific tracer of PET imaging can be useful as a non-invasive tool to restage the disease and monitor treatment response as highlighted by the imaging aspects of this rare entity in our case.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Neuroendocrine tumour， Endometrial Cancer， Imaging\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Neuroendocrine neoplasias (NENs) are aggressive malignan-cies derived from neuroendocrine cells.The term neuroen-docrine refers to the fact that the tumour cells originate from the embryonic neuroectoderm and display an immunohistochem-ical profile consistent with endocrine glandular cells.NENs are typically located in the gastrointestinal tract， the pancreas and the lungs and are subdivided into well-differentiated NENs and poorly differentiated NENs . Well-differentiated NENs include neuroendocrine tumours (NET) G1 (also known as typical carcinoid)， NET G2 (also known as atypical carci-noid) and NET G3. Poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carci-noma(NECs)include small cell NEC and large cell NEC.\n\n【4】Rarely， NENs may also occur in other organs such as the fe-male genital tract . Small cell carcinoma of the endometrium isPathological diagnosis helps to exclude overlapping findings from other tumours. Imaging remains the mainstay for diag-nosing the extent of local and distant disease spread. Surgery(hysterectomy) is the first treatment option in non-metastatic disease. Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation treatment are considered in locally aggressive tumours and disease with the distant spread.\n\n【5】We are discussing a rare case of primary neuroendocrine uterine tumour in an old lady. The clinical presentation，imag-ing findings， histological diagnosis and management will be discussed in light of the literature review.\n\n【6】Case report\n\n【7】A 65 years old Pakistani postmenopausal lady presented with a history of vaginal bleeding for seven months. She has five children with one abortion history with her first baby born at the age of 24. No history of contraception. She has a strong family history of various cancers. No significant findings noted on clinical examination. The patient underwent magnetic reso-nance imaging (MRI) pelvis as baseline imaging for local staging， which showed large soft tissue mass filling the uterus， unlike other tumours which involve endometrium and extending to thecervix. There is an extension into parametrium as well . Bilateral enlarged pelvic nodes were seen which were extending into the left pelvic sidewall and tethered to the musculature. Computed tomography scan (CT) chest and abdomen showed few abdominal nodes in para-aortic and common iliac locations. Endocervical sampling showed features of small cell neuroendocrine tumour. After multidisciplinary team (MDT) discussion， she had PET CT for distant staging， which showed avid metastatic mediastinal node， which was missed on CT and extensive avid abdominal nodal disease . It was de-cided to give neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery. She had three cycles of Cisplatin and Etoposide. Post chemother-apy MRI  revealed minimal residual soft tissue， whereas PET scan  showed excellent response without any avid disease. Hence， surgery was deferred.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Endometrial neuroendocrine carcinoma is a rare histological variant of endometrial carcinoma， accounting for 1% of all en-dometrial cancers. The average age of onset of endometrial cancer is 60 years， of which 75% occurs in women over 50， and about 90% of patients with endometrial cancer have vaginal bleeding， especially after menopause. The age of onset of NECE is wide， ranging from 37 to 87， the median age is 57， and the most common onset age is from 60-70 with the most com-mon symptom being vaginal bleeding like other endometrial cancers. However， there are 2 cases of Cushing’s syndrome ，4 cases of retinopathy and few cases of lower abdominal pain， weight loss and vaginal discharge. For patients presenting with paraneoplastic syndrome， the possibility of NECE should be considered.\n\n【10】Pathological examination is needed to differentiate mixed fea-tures with large cell types. The diagnosis of SCNEC requires at least one positive neuroendocrine marker： CgA， neuron-specificenolase， Syn or CD56 . Imaging plays a crucial role to look for the local extent of the disease and distant metastasis. MRI gives excellent soft-tissue contrast to depict uterine and parametrial invasion， pelvic nodal disease and relation with surrounding structures. CT/PET CT is done to image for distant metastatic disease. Etoposide/Cisplatin (EP) was the most commonly used chemotherapeutic regimen for such tumours. In the ad-vanced stage， concurrent chemoradiation with EP was noted to be associated with better 5-year survival. Patients with small size tumours are usually subjected to surgery and surveillance or chemotherapy. Delay in treatment results in the worst out-comes.\n\n【11】The overall 5-year survival for patients with low and inter-mediate grades is 36.8% and 8.9%， respectively indicating the poor prognosis.\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】Primary uterine neuroendocrine tumours are rare and usually behave aggressively. Imaging features help to differentiate and stage these tumours， which can change management deci-sions accordingly. Our case shows unusually good response on imaging resulting in the reduction of patient’s morbidity of the surgery.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "27b314cb-7818-4bc4-af10-91a134a2708f", "title": null, "text": "【0】ABSTRACT Objective： Eclampsia is characterized by the presence of one or more convulsions together with a preeclamp-sia condition. A significant contributor to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality is eclampsia. The emerging world is likewise seriously concerned about it. Analyzing eclampsia patients and assessing maternal and perinatal outcomes were the objectives. Method： The study was conducted at Hi-Tech Medical College & Hospital， Bhubaneswar for one year. The study enrolled parents who had eclampsia and associated complications at 23 weeks of pregnancy. In addition， complete obstetrical investigations with results for the mother and the baby were recorded. Results： At this facility， the annual prevalence of eclampsia was 1.1%， accounting for 140 cases during the study period. The vast majority of the 140 cases (93%) were sent to our center from first and second referral units dispersed over a number of minor districts nearby. Nearly three-fourths of the cases were primigravida， and the average age of the cases at presentation was 23.8±3.97 years. Nearly 40% of cases experienced obstetrical complications brought on by eclampsia， and nearly37.2% of cases had medical complications. At our facility， 11% of mothers of eclampsia babies died. Conclusion： The occurrence of this dangerous condition in pregnancy can be decreased by providing sufficient antenatal care and detecting pre-eclampsia syndrome early on. These ladies can find optimum management if the healthcare professionals in the outlying centers promptly refer them.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Maternal mortality， perinatal loss， eclampsia， preeclampsia， and magnesium sulfate\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】One of the worst medical complications of pregnancy， hyper-tensive problems affect 5 to 10 percent of all  pregnancies.\n\n【4】Mildly raised blood pressure to severe hypertension and organ dysfunction are on the disease's continuum. Eclampsia is one of these， and it is the most severe type of the illness spectrum and a significant issue in developing nations like India . The word \"eclampsia\" is a Greek word that means \"flash of lightning.\" Eclampsia， which can occur during pregnancy or after childbirth and is accompanied by generalized tonic-clonic convulsions or coma， is referred to as such. Eclampsia incidence in India has been observed to range from 0.179 to 3.7 percent. According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates， hypertensive disorders during pregnancy contributed to 16% of maternal deaths .\n\n【5】Trends in Molecudar Medicine\n\n【6】MethodS\n\n【7】Study Design：\n\n【8】Hi-Tech Medical College & Hospital， Bhubaneswar conducted this cross-sectional investigation for one year.\n\n【9】Methodology：\n\n【10】Patients’ case files from the obstetric high-dependency unit served as the data's primary source. A systematic performance was used to record information on age， parity， education， book-ing status， risk factors for eclampsia， management， and fetal-maternal death.\n\n【11】Sample Size：\n\n【12】140 pregnant women who met the inclusion criteria were en-rolled in this study.\n\n【13】Inclusion criteria：\n\n【14】pregnant individuals with eclampsia who are above 23 weeks of pregnancy\n\n【15】Exclusion criteria：\n\n【16】People who have epilepsy or other conditions that might cause seizures， such as fever， electrolyte imbalance， and hypoglycemia.\n\n【17】Results\n\n【18】There were 140 cases of eclampsia out of the 350 births made overall throughout the research period， giving the condition a period prevalence of 1.22%. The current study's patients with eclampsia had a mean age of 23.8±3.97 years， ranging in age from 18 to 48. Only 3.2% and 1.2% of the cases were less than 19and more than 40 years old， respectively. The bulk， 87.2% of the cases， were in the 21-30 age group. The majority of cases-nearly73%-were nulligravida， whereas 21.2% were multigravida. In addition， 92% of the patients had completed at least their first year of school. Most (75%) came from rural areas. Preeclampsia with an early onset affected 46.5% of cases， the majority of which(33.2%) occurred between 28 and 33 weeks of gestation. After33 weeks of gestation， 53.2% of the babies were born， and no post-term births were noted.\n\n【19】The progression of the eclampsia women from the referral center to admission to our center is listed in Table 1. During the study period，there were 77.2% antepartum， 1.2% intrapartum， and 9.2% postpartum instances of eclampsia， according to the Ming of Convulsion. In 3% of cases， convulsions occurred dur-ing the pregnancy delivery， and recovery periods. At this time， the blood pressure in nearly 74.5% of cases was less than 150/120mmHg. Systolic blood pressure in 21.2 instances ranged from160 to 178 mmHg， and diastolic blood pressure ranged from 110to 128 mmHg.\n\n【20】More than 170/120 mmHg was present in 3% of the popula-tion. 21% of victims only experienced one convulsion. In 43.5%of instances， there were more than four convulsions. Within an hour after the initial convulsion episode， 19.2% of cases arrived at our centre for treatment， but only 7.5% did so. Poor Glasgow Coma Scores were present in cases that arrived at our centre more than 7 hours after the first convulsion or after more than3 convulsions. (GCS). At our facility， magnesium sulphate is the medication of choice to stop convulsions in women with preeclampsia and eclampsia. 93% of the 140 instances received magnesium sulphate treatment. 61.3% of deliveries were vagi-nal， while 36.5% were caesarean sections. One percent of pa-tients passed away during pregnancy without giving birth to a child. 62.5% of people had no medical issues. Among the others， a large number of individuals suffered more than one eclampsia-related complication. 3.0% of instances of aspiration pneumonitis and 2.5% of cases of trauma from falling out of bed during eclampsia， respectively， were reported. In our study， acute kidney injury was the most prevalent medical complica-tion linked to eclampsia， occurring in 16.5% of patients. This was followed by HELLP syndrome (hemolysis，increased liver enzyme levels， and low platelet levels) in 15.2% of patients. Pa tients with status eclampsia， posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)， and cerebral haemorrhage comprised 15.2%of the total patient population. Other complications included peripartum cardiomyopathy in 6.5% of pregnant women， dis-seminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in 11.2% of pregnant women， and pulmonary edema in 3.2% of pregnant women.\n\n【21】Discussion\n\n【22】According to data from earlier studies ， the study's period prevalence of eclampsia was 1.1%. When compared to wealthy nations， the prevalence of eclampsia is significantly higher .73% of the cases were primigravida， and almost 91% of them were under 30 years old. Numerous studies have linked Both of these factors to eclampsia . Most of the patients with eclamp-sia who arrived at our obstetric emergency room were unbooked cases as well as those who had been booked from other outlying centres with a scheduled follow-up. It illustrates the negative consequences of these women's low socioeconomic position and noncompliance with antenatal care on their ability to execute obstetric procedures.\n\n【23】According to research by Joshi et al. and Nobis et al. ， inadequate prenatal care is frequently associated by untreated medical conditions like hypertensive disorders in pregnancy. Eclampsia is more prevalent in the third trimester； similarly， in our analysis， 86.5% of eclampsia cases appeared in the third trimester with the majority occurring between 29 and 36 weeks of gestation (63% cases)， as has been observed in other studies J. Only 3% of the cases of intrapartum eclampsia and 9.2% of the cases of postpartum eclampsia in our study were comparable to those in the studies of Sowjanya et al and Edgar et al ，whereas the majority of eclampsia cases in our study appeared in the antepartum period (77.2%).\n\n| Characteristic  | Percentage  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Time of Eclampsia  | Time of Eclampsia  |\n| Antepartum  | 77.2%  |\n| Intrapartum  | 3%  |\n| Postpartum  | 9.2%  |\n| Antepartum+ Intrapartum+ Postpartum  | 3%  |\n| No. of Convulsions  |  |\n| 2  | 21%  |\n| 3-5  | 37.2%  |\n| \\>5  | 46.5%  |\n| From the beginning of the convulsion to admittance  |  |\n| \\>2 hours  | 19.2%  |\n| 3-5hours  | 25.2%  |\n| 5-9 hours  | 24.5%  |\n| \\>9hours  | 30.5%  |\n| MgSO4 treatment  |  |\n| Received  | 95%  |\n| Not Received  | 5%  |\n| Diagnosed with Pre-eclampsia  | Diagnosed with Pre-eclampsia  |\n| Yes  | 35%  |\n| No  | 65%  |\n\n【25】Although there are more postpartum eclampsia cases in the first 24 hours， few instances in our study had eclampsia de-velop after 48 hours . There were not many cases over the world. Eclampsia postpartum as late as two weeks after deliv-ery. The pathogenesis of postpartum eclampsia is the release of fibrin degradation products (FDP) as the placenta separates during the postpartum phase . In most cases， eclampsia is distinguished by a chronic， progressive process that starts with the onset of preeclampsia and ends in generalised convulsions or coma. However， in 15% to 20% of cases， eclampsia may develop suddenly without any indication of preeclampsia . Preeclampsia nearly always preceded eclampsia in our investi-gation. Preeclampsia was recognised in nearly 35% of instances during the prenatal period， although only 22.5% of those pa-tients received regular care.\n\n【26】The majority of eclamptic women reported warning signs and symptoms such headache (91%)， visual abnormalities (39.2%)， nausea and vomiting (27%) and discomfort in the right upper quadrant and/or epigastrium (3.2%). However， these signs were not always present before convulsions. When a patient was ad-mitted to our center， over 42.5% of instances experienced more than four convulsions. Convulsion frequency correlated with GCS score at admission. In our study， 19.2% of epileptic women who presented within an hour of the initial convulsion had nocomplications， but 17 of the women who presented after seven hours had complications， including acute kidney injury， HELLP syndrome， intracranial haemorrhage， and other obstetrical is-sues like an atrophied placenta and intrauterine foetal death. We may therefore extrapolate that the frequency of seizures and the time between the first convulsion and therapy are crucial fac-tors in determining the maternal and perinatal fate in eclampsia cases.\n\n【27】Serum creatinine and liver enzyme (ALT/AST) abnormalities were often observed in our study， occurring in 24.5%(24.6%) and18.5% instances， respectively. Approximately 34.5% of cases had thrombocytopenia. At our facility parenteral magnesium sul-phate is the medication of choice for managing and preventing eclamptic convulsions due to its anconvulsant and neuroprotec-tive effects. Due to the poor general health of the 140 patients， including those with cerebral hemorrhage， pre-existing chronic renal illness， acute kidney injury， and those who needed ven-tilator support， 5% cases (6%) of the 140 patients did not get magnesium sulphate. According to the findings of three ran-domised trials， magnesium sulphate is more effective than a placebo at preventing seizures in women with severe preeclamp-sia.\n\n【28】Magnesium sulphate may be helpful for women with mild preeclampsia， however this is not yet evident. At this facility， it is standard practise to provide parenteral magnesium sulphate to any woman who has severe preeclampsia or eclampsia. Themost often prescribed medication for blood pressure control at our facility is oral labetalol， followed by oral nifedipine. If the systolic blood pressure is greater than 170 mmHg and the diastolic blood pressure is greater than 120 mmHg， as well as in patients with impaired GCS， intravenous labetalol， starting with a 20 mg intravenous bolus， is favoured. If this is ineffective after 10 minutes， 30 mg and then 70 mg are administered again， each dose 10 minutes apart. To avoid end organ damage in hypertensive emergencies， intravenous nitroglycerin is used if hypertension persists .\n\n【29】The only effective treatment for eclampsia， regardless of ges-tation， is termination of pregnancy. Maternal morbidity and death increase as a result of prenatal care. Within 24 hours of being admitted to our center， the pregnancy was terminated. Each eclamptic woman was advised against having a vaginal de-livery. Based on the cervical Bishop score， the presence of labor， and the gestational age of the fetus， the decision to conduct a caesarean section was made. Eclampsia plus foetal development restriction， an unfavourable cervix， and other conditions where a delay of more than 12 hours is anticipated betweenthe induction of labour and delivery were treated with a caesarean section. Cervical ripening required prostaglandins，ideally misoprostol， whereas labour induction required mechanical techniques， such as the use of a foley's catheter and misoprostol. For accelerating labor， amniotomies and oxytocin infusions were favoured tech-niques. Successful vaginal deliveries were made to women with poor foetal outcomes whose gestational ages were fewer than 30weeks.\n\n【30】In our survey， the preferred method of ending pregnancy was vaginal birth. Preeclampsia， which is followed by eclampsia， is linked to high maternal morbidity. Preeclampsia is a multi-systemic condition that causes a variety of maternal complica-tions. Acute kidney injury (AKI；16.5% of cases)，PRES syndrome(15.2% of cases)， and HELLP syndrome (15.2% of cases) were the most frequent complications seen in eclampsia patients in our study. There were also other complications such peripar-tum cardiomyopathy， aspiration pneumonis， and pulmonary oedema. 14.6% of the 140 cases including women needed critical care units (ICU)， and 7.2% needed ventilator assistance.\n\n【31】Extracellular fluid is mobilised during the first few days after giving birth， which results in an increase in intravascular volume. Women with impaired renal function are therefore more likely to experience postpartum convulsions， pulmonary oedema， and an exacerbation of severe hypertension . As a result， eclampc women should have their blood pressure closely monitored and their fluid intake and urine output accurately measured.\n\n【32】During the time of our analysis， 1% of all maternal deaths were eclampsia-related. which， as compared to other research， was somewhat less. The most frequent causes of mor-tality in these patients were major cerebral hemorrhage， pul-monary oedema， peripheral cardiomyopathy，and coagulation problems.\n\n【33】Poor neonatal and perinatal outcomes are primarily influ-enced by gestational age， birth weight， intrauterine growth re-striction， preterm， and birth asphyxia. The perinatal loss was26.6% at our facility， matching estimates from Sunita et al.  and Sowjanya et al.\n\n【34】Conclusion\n\n【35】This study helps to highlight the significance of comprehending the disease process and the impact of eclampsia in maternal and perinatal outcomes since hypertensive diseases complicatingpregnancy continue to be the leading cause of maternal and peri-natal morbidity and mortality globally. This study demonstrates that there is unmistakable proof that attentive prenatal care and essential specialized newborn care units have decreased the incidence of serious illness and enhanced perinatal outcomes. Eclampsia is a preventable complication of preeclampsia；there-fore， careful prenatal care， early and timely intervention， and a proper high-dependency unit at a tertiary hospital with the assistance of a multidisciplinary team including obstetricians， anesthesiologists， and intensivists will undoubtedly decrease the trend in morbidity and mortality of eclampsia patients in India. Despite effective management， the morbidity is increased by limited drug accessibility， subpar transportation facilities in the first and second referral units， a shortage of specialist doc-tors， and inadequate infrastructure. Therefore， obstetric trainees and midwives in particular at remote hospitals must undergo frequent training.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Healthcare workers must utilize appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and infection control prevention techniques given the high risk of transmission and potential morbidity associated with COVID-19. We present a case report high-lighting the strengths and potential applications of telemedicine technology in a patient's evaluation during an ongoing emerging， novel infectious disease.\n\n【2】Case Report： A 67-year-old male presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with complaints of fever. His presentation coincided with a recent declaration of a pandemic caused by COVID-19 and a known exposure. Telemedicine evaluation was performed using InTouch Provider\" software (InTouch Health， Goleta， CA， USA). The treating cli-nician was able to interact with the patient entirely through observations via web camera.COVID-19 nasopha-ryngeal swab polymerase chain reaction testing was ordered and was performed by a dedicated triage nurse. The patient was deemed stable for discharge given his normal vital signs and well appearance. Approximately72 hours after discharge from the ED， the patient was contacted with positive COVID-19 swab results.\n\n【3】Conclusions： We present the first known case report highlighting use of telemedicine to diagnosis COVID-19 in a patient present in the ED. With the appropriate systems in place， this method of evaluating the patient helped to limit clinician exposure， decrease risk of transmission to key personnel， and assisted with preserving PPE supplies. Use of telemedicine affords multiple benefits in the effective diagnosis， evaluation， and potential prevention of spread of COVID-19.\n\n【4】MeSH Keywords： Coronavirus Infections ·COVID-19·Telemedicine\n\n【5】Coronavirus disease 2019， also known as COVID-19， was first reported in human patients in late 2019 in Wuhan， China. Subsequently， the virus achieved a foothold rapidly worldwide， with the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring a pan-demic in March 2020 . Given the high risk of transmission， morbidity， and mortality associated with COVID-19， healthcare providers must utilize appropriate personal protective equip-ment and infection control prevention techniques . The use of telemedicine technology in diagnosis of COVID-19 has not previously been reported in the literature， and we present a case report highlighting the strengths and potential applica-tions of this method of patient evaluation in the setting of an emerging， novel infectious disease.\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】A 67-year-old male presented to the Emergency Department(ED) with a chief complaint of fever for the past 4 days. The pa-tient reported that he was on a private flight 6 days prior to his ED visit. He subsequently learned that another passen-ger on the plane tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). He reports a highest temperature measured of 102°F (38.9℃). The patient denied any cough or shortness of breath. He did report generalized myalgias and malaise. After communicating with the local Department of Health， the patient was instructed to report to the ED for further testing. He drove himself directly to our ED.\n\n【8】Given that this patient's presentation coincided with a recent declaration of a pandemic caused by COVID-19， he was imme-diately placed in a triage room dedicated for evaluation of this emerging infection. The patient was masked immediately upon his arrival and throughout his visit. A nurse with full personal protective equipment (PPE) including N95 face mask， eyewear， gloves， and gown performed initial triage while simultaneously initiating telemedicine evaluation using InTouch Provider@ soft-ware (InTouch Health， Goleta， CA， USA)， interfacing via a smart tablet device in the room. After logging in， the physician pro-vider (present in the main ED central work area) utilized the web camera， headset， and microphone at his workstation to begin remote evaluation of the patient during the nurse’s tri-age process. The free-standing smart tablet device  remained stationed in the triage room throughout the encoun-ter， and the physician and patient could see and hear one an-other using this video webcam interface.\n\n【9】The nurse obtained the following full set of vital signs： temper-ature of 37.4℃， blood pressure of 151/81， pulse of 57 beats per minute， respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute， and ox-ygen saturation of 98%. The physician continued his patientassessment utilizing the InTouch Provider@ Freestanding Smart Tablet Workstation and InTouch Provider software (InTouch Health， Goleta， CA， USA). Review of systems was otherwise negative， and the patient reported no significant medical his-tory other than mild chronic leukopenia with total white blood cell counts ranging from 3.0 to 4.5×10°/L over the last 8 years. The patient reported no medication use other than over-the-counter acetaminophen for fever.\n\n【10】The treating clinician was able to interact with the patient through observations via web camera， observing body move-ments， assessing speech， and visualizing respiratory breathing pattern. Physical examination revealed no acute distress upon general evaluation. The patient’s eyes appeared normal without conjunctival irritation or jaundice. Bluetooth stethoscope tech-nology was incorporated into the examination： the triage nurse applied the stethoscope to the patient's chest and back as the physician“auscultated\" remotely through the headset. No ad-ventitious breath sounds， or obvious abnormal cardiac murmurs were noted. Facial and upper extremity skin tone appeared normal without cyanosis or plethora. Mood and affect appeared normal.\n\n【11】Given the presenting complaint， symptoms， and known expo-sure， COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab real-time reverse tran-scriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was ordered. (This RT-PCR swab was analyzed utilizing Cepheid's GenXpert@sys-tem.) The triage nurse collected the swab， while the physician performed the evaluation entirely using the telemedicine plat-form. The patient was informed that he would be contacted with results of his COVID-19 testing， but was deemed stable for discharge given his normal vital signs and well appearance. He was instructed to self-quarantine and follow further instruc-tions from the Department of Health on duration of quaran-tine if the results of his COVID-19 test returned positive. He was told to return immediately for any shortness of breath， coughing， or breathing difficulty. Approximately 72 hours after discharge from the ED， the patient was contacted with posi-tive COVID-19 swab results. He reported low-grade fever that was ongoing but no new symptoms. He was cleared and con-sidered recovered from COVID-19 approximately 2 weeks after his initial ED visit； no repeat testing was performed.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】To the best of our knowledge， we present the first known case report highlighting use of telemedicine to diagnosis COVID-19in a patient present in the ED. With the appropriate systems in place， this method of evaluating the patient helped to limit cli-nician exposure， decrease risk of transmission to key person-nel， and assisted with preserving PPE supplies. Although the triage nurse still had contact with the patient， this individual was designated in that role for the entirety of their shift and had limited physical movement within the ED. In the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic， one of the ED triage rooms at our facility was dedicated for \"screening\"and was used exclusive-ly for patients presenting with possible COVID-19 symptoms. Others have reported use of “fever clinics\" for similar purpos-es during this outbreak， but a full description of the physi-cal setup of such clinics is limited and no use of telemedicine technology is discussed in these reports. One commentary sug-gests the use of telemedicine in order to \"forward triage” pa-tients even prior to their arrival in the ED . This proposed method may help sort and screen patients with symptoms concerning for COVID-19 to help protect other patients in the ED，providers， and the general community from being exposed.\n\n【14】The InTouch Provider@ software (InTouch Health， Goleta， CA， USA) was installed at all workstations in our ED. Providers were trained in real-time while on duty and via electron-ic communications from hospital leadership and the depart-ment of information technology. User interface and naviga-tion was straightforward and similar to other smart device applications. Communication remained remarkably clear usingbuilt-in speakers (tablet device) on the patient-end and head-set on the provider-end. Bluetooth@ stethoscope technology re-quired a temporary pause in all communication while the pro-vider's headset exclusively received sound transmitted by the Bluetooth@ stethoscope. In this way the physician could focus on any transmitted heart or lung sounds. Use of such telemed-icine cart systems has been described in recent internation-al literature as a means of limiting healthcare workers expo-sure . Overall， this method of evaluation was well-received by the patient in our case after explaining the need to help prevent exposure and potential spread of COVID-19.Other re-ports have opined， however， that patients may not be satisfied without a face-to-face encounter with the treating provider .\n\n【15】In efforts to ensure that hospitals have capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide additional access to pa-tients， the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued changes to expand coverage for care using telehealth services in April 2020 . While the primary intention of this govern-mental initiative was to expand at-home care， we report use of telemedicine technology on hospital grounds to care for an active COVID-19 patient. Also， our department's use of tele-medicine systems preceded this rollout of expanded coverage by approximately one month. As use of telemedicine expands， we anticipate that it will be a key player during future pandem-ics and disasters. By instituting remote consultations， this mo-dality can help during times of crisis when provider coverage may be limited as a result of a contracted workforce second-ary to ill or quarantined healthcare providers unable to pres-ent for work . Furthermore， remote care provided via tele-health can help reduce the risk of disease transmission to all of the healthcare workforce within the hospital . Our case highlights utility of telemedicine in potential high-risk clinical scenarios where infection control and PPE shortages  are paramount concerns.\n\n【16】Conclusions\n\n【17】Clinicians should consider telemedicine as an adjunct in the evaluation of COVID-19 or other emerging infections. After carefully screening patients virtually， providers may be able to confidently diagnose and treat patients remotely while limit-ing exposure risks， decreasing PPE usage， and limiting patient traffic through the ED. Patients that require advanced medi-cal care (along with invasive measures) should be treated in the usual manner based on standard of care measures in line with local guidelines of their institution.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

They are generally handled by laparoscopic surgical removal if they are larger than 5 cm. However， very large cysts may require splenectomy. Another factor in the choice of therapy is the patient’s underlying condition. We present the case of a giant splenic cyst in a woman 1 year after a renal transplant.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 28-year-old woman presented with acute abdominal pain and nausea. One year before， she had received an ABO-identical living donor renal transplantation from her father， and was maintained on oral tacrolimus and prednisolone. A CT scan with contrast showed enteric ileus and an abnormal position of the spleen， which was involved by a cyst measuring 12x12.5x9 cm. A nasogastric tube， and later a small bowel tube， were inserted to decompress the ileus. The patient underwent laparotomy 11 days after admission. We confirmed an internal hernia with volvulus due to migration of the spleen； however， there was no evidence of necrosis. The patient was treated with splenectomy and reduction of the hernia. There were no complications.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】This was a very unusual emergency following renal transplantation. Splenectomy has been performed in the past for immunosuppression in cases of donor ABO-incompatibility. We therefore considered that it would be more expedient to remove the spleen than to remove the cyst and perform splenopexy.\n\n【6】MeSH Keywords： Hernia ·lleus· Intestinal Volvulus· Spleen\n\n【7】Splenic cysts are unusual. Approximately 25% are primary(i.e.， containing an epithelial lining)， and can be congenital or the result of parasitic infestation or neoplasm. Secondary cysts are usually due to trauma， and can also be associated with infection and prior splenic infarct. Cysts larger than 5 cm are generally removed laparoscopically . Very large cysts， or cysts in patients with comorbidities， present more of a chal-lenge. Successful laparoscopic cystectomy has been performed in a pregnant patient . A cyst in a wandering spleen is also quite challenging； with its associated risk of splenic torsion， it is usually treated with splenectomy .\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 28-year-old woman presented with acute lower abdominal pain and nausea. Her past history was significant for a live do-nor renal transplant from her father 1 year prior to presenta-tion. Physical examination revealed a mass in the mid-lower abdomen. There was no rebound tenderness. She denied re-cent trauma. Laboratory tests revealed dehydration but normal renal function. A contrast-enhanced abdominal CT \nshowed evidence of ileus， and a wandering spleen with a large cyst (12x12.5x9 cm) was identified in the lower abdomen. We first inserted a nasogastric (NG) tube， which was then substi-tuted with a 16-Fr small bowel tube to decompress the small intestine， and then started infusion of fluids and electrolytes. Tacrolimus and prednisolone were administered intravenously. The abdominal distention and pain gradually resolved， and C-reactive protein (CRP) improved from 44.4 nmol/L on admis-sion to 6.29 nmol/L 10 days later. Laparotomy was performed under general anesthesia via a midline lower abdominal inci-sion on POD 11. A wandering spleen with giant cyst was con-firmed  and was noted to compress the small intes-tine. A small amount of ascites was noted. We drew fluid from the giant cyst by fine-needle aspiration to reduce its volume. An internal hernia was present， with small bowel incarcerated between the spleen and splenic hilum . There was no evidence of intestinal ischemia. We performed a splenec-tomy and reduced the internal hernia. The histopathologicaldiagnosis was epithelial cyst of the spleen. The postoperative course was uneventful and she left the hospital 7 days after the operation.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】The spleen is fixed by the gastrosplenic，splenorenal， phreno-splenic， and splenocolic ligaments. Wandering spleen occurs when these ligaments are not fully developed or are abnor-mally attached . The male-to-female ratio is 1： 4 and occur-rence is highest in young people aged less than 40 years . In the case of splenic infarction， splenectomy is indicated， but splenopexy is an option if the spleen is not ischemic. To date， few studies have reported a wandering spleen with giant cyst ，and the approach to treatment is controversial. In the present case， no splenic infarction was identified on CT， and the kidney graft she received 1 year previously required pro-tection. Accordingly， we inserted a long tube for decompres-sion and corrected her dehydration. Eleven days after admis-sion， she underwent elective surgery. The size of the incision was not conducive to splenopexy， so we performed splenec-tomy. The postoperative course was uneventful.\n\n【12】Splenectomy in liver transplantation has been controversial； it is usually avoided in deceased donor transplants due to an increased risk of sepsis， but is often used with living donor transplantation to reduce portal venous pressure， especially in small-sized grafts， without increasing the risk of sepsis .\n\n【13】In renal transplantation， splenectomy， or its medical equiva-lent， rituximab， has been employed to reduce de novo  or pre-existing  HLA antibody production. An inhibitory ef-fect for rituximab or splenectomy has not been found against de novo Ab production ， while different， desensitizing proce-dures (plasmapheresis， lIg) to remove pre-existing antibodies have been shown to be equally effective as rituximab or sple-nectomy ， although early death rates in ABO-incompatible recipients were higher .\n\n【14】Conclusions\n\n【15】Here， we present an unusual case of wandering spleen with a large cyst causing internal herniation and ileus of the small bowel in a living related-donor renal transplant patient. Given the need for immunosuppression and the need to protect the graft from the risks of a long operation， the decision to re-move the spleen was based on limiting the extent of surgery.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

One hypothesis explaining this con-dition is that the cutaneous branches of these spinal nerves coursing perpendicularly through the multifidus muscle cause them to be impinged， thereby leading to a peripheral sensory neuropathy which can manifest as a persistent itching sensa-tion . However， degenerative changes， which can be seen on imaging of the spine， have also been linked to this syndrome and represent another source of entrapment . The exact in-cidence of NP is unknown as it remains largely underreported.\n\n【6】The presence of intense itch can lead to scratching and hyper-keratosis of the skin which can be seen on physical examina-tion， while skin biopsy can reveal nonspecific post-inflamma-tory hyperpigmentation . Other features associated with a neuropathic process can be present as well， such as paresthe-sia， hypoesthesia， allodynia， or hyperalgesia .\n\n【7】Treatments previously described for notalgia paresthetica in-clude topical agents such as lidocaine  and capsaicin . Unfortunately， their effect is temporary and requires multiple applications per day which can be difficult for the patient to reach when targeting the interscapular area. Systemic agents used in neuropathic pain conditions such as gabapentin and ox-carbazepine have been describes as well  but good quality randomized controlled trials are lacking. Onabotulinum toxin A intramuscular injections in the pruritic area were shown to be ineffective . Non-invasive modalities including transcu-taneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)， physical therapy， and osteopathic manipulation have been reported in a small number of patients with inconsistent relief .\n\n【8】In this article， we present a case of NP that was successfully treated with intravenous lidocaine infusions， a modality fre-quently used in neuropathic pain conditions but not previously described for pruritic nerve entrapment syndromes.\n\n【9】Case Report\n\n【10】A 50-year-old Caucasian woman was referred to our pain man-agement clinic with an eight year history of back and lower limb pain following a T3-T7 laminectomy. The surgical inter-vention was performed for drainage of a thoracic epidural ab-scess in the context of intravenous drug use. The patient suf-fered partial spinal cord damage caused by the abscess and continued to have spasticity and diffuse neuropathic pain be-low the lesion. Following rehabilitation， the patient regainedfull segmental strength in her lower limbs and was ambulat-ing with Canadian crutches. The patient's other comorbidities included longstanding insomnia， generalized anxiety， and gas-troesophageal reflux disease. At the age of 37， she underwent anterior C5-C7 fusion for a herniated disc and spinal stenosis， without any neurological deficit following surgery.\n\n【11】Within the first year after abscess drainage， she developed a pruritic patch of skin medial to her right shoulder blade. The itch was very bothersome and the patient underwent an eval-uation by a dermatologist.A diagnosis of NP was made with-out the need for a skin biopsy. A trial of oral antihistamines and topical hydrocortisone cream was unsuccessful. The symp-toms of intense itching with compulsive thoughts of scratch-ing her back with a sharp object continued to persist.\n\n【12】Prior to her referral to our center， the patient had undergone successful treatment for her addiction at a detoxification cen-ter and was started on maintenance methadone for both ad-diction and pain.\n\n【13】Over the course of three years since her initial evaluation at our clinic， the management focused on treating her neuro-pathic pain and spasticity. She was started on pharmacolog-ical therapy， including pregabalin 300 mg (orally two times a day)， methadone was maintained at 30 mg (orally， three times per day)， and nabilone 0.5 mg (orally at bedtime). Her break-through medication was acetaminophen 300 mg/codeine 30 mg tablets of which she would take 2-4 tablets per day. To treat her insomnia， she was started on mirtazapine 15 mg orally at bedtime and quetiapine 12.5-25 mg orally at bedtime. For the management of her spasticity， she was taking orphenadrine200 mg orally at bedtime after failing to respond to cycloben-zaprine， methocarbamol， and baclofen. None of these treat-ments had any effect on her itch， which she continued to de-scribe as pervasive because it was constant and unreachable.\n\n【14】At our Pain Management Center， a series of intravenous lido-caine infusions were proposed as a treatment plan for her neu-ropathic sublesional pain syndrome. At that time， she presented three different sources of discomfort. The first was a burning pain in her feet， posterior thighs， and buttocks which she rat-ed as 8/10 on a 0 to 10 numerical pain rating scale (NRS) . She also described stabbing and burning pain in the midline thoracic area as 6/10 on the NRS. The second source of pain corresponded to the surgical incision site. Both sources of pain were independent of spinal mobility and were worsened by light touch or pressure. The third source of discomfort was the itch due to NP which was rated as 3/10 on the NRS， constant， and without any day to night variability. On physical exami-nation of the patient's back， a diffuse allodynia and pressure hyperalgesia was noted over her entire back region. The pru-ritic patch of skin did not show any hyperpigmentation butseveral auto-induced scratch marks were visible medial to the tip of the right scapula. The area of pruritus  did not demonstrate hypoesthesia.\n\n【15】She underwent a series of three infusions of lidocaine at two week intervals， at a dose of 1 mg/kg bolus followed by4 mg/kg infusion over one hour (75 mg bolus and 300 mg in-fusion for 78 kg female). Following the first two infusions， no change was noted in the level of neuropathic pain. However， a significant improvement of the itch was noted. Specifically， after a 12 hour delay， a 90% improvement was reported last-ing seven days after the first treatment and 10 days after the second. When the itch progressively reoccurred， it was less intense than at baseline and reached only 80% of its origi-nal severity. After the third infusion， the patient experienced a profound decrease in lower limb pain with a NRS of 1/10for the duration of 14 days. The thoracic pain remained un-changed. The itch disappeared completely for the duration of three weeks with a progressive return to baseline within themonth . The patient reported a high level of satisfac-tion during periods of relief as she had been able to forget about the itch and had good pain control. The patient also noted improved activities of daily living and social activities. However， the dimensions of the pruritic region on examina-tion remained unchanged upon reassessment. Subsequently， lidocaine infusions were continued at four week intervals. She did not experience any adverse effects during the infusions.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】The pathophysiology of NP， which by definition is a sensory pe-ripheral neuropathy， remains hypothetical at the present time as cases have been reported with and without thoracic nerve entrapment in corresponding dermatomes . The patient described in our case exhibited evidence of mild spinal cord at-rophy on magnetic resonance imaging at the thoracic level cor-responding to the notalgia location. A spinal cord injury in asso-ciation with neuropathic itch has been described previously  but attributing it as a cause of NP in our case remains spec-ulative. Spinal cord atrophy does not explain why the pruritic patch is unilateral despite causing bilateral sublesional neuro-pathic pain. Possibly， the development of notalgia in our patient could have been secondary to paraspinal muscle retraction in-traoperatively or due to its spasm postoperatively which could in turn cause cutaneous nerve branch injury. The pruritic area in our patient extended over several dermatomes， as is usually the case， with involvement ranging from one to six dermatomes .\n\n【18】Treatment approaches for NP have been largely adapted from those used for neuropathic pain conditions. Intravenous lido caine has been extensively utilized for pain management in both acute and chronic settings . Systemic lidocaine has been shown to inhibit peripheral and central pain transmission through the blockage of voltage-sensitive sodium channels . However， recent in vitro studies demonstrated that calcium and potassium channels， N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors as well as modulation of the immune response， may also be involved . Several meta-analyses demonstrated that systemic lidocaine，both in parenteral and oral formulations， is superior to place-bo in treating chronic neuropathic pain . The majority of randomized controlled studies looking at neuropathic pain due to various underlying causes have shown 5 mg/kg of in-travenous lidocaine to be effective . Specifically in spinal cord injury， Attal et al. achieved a reduction in spontaneous pain and allodynia . The difference in our case was the administration of a bolus dose of 1 mg/kg to achieve a rapid plasma concentration followed by an infusion of 4 mg/kg. The optimal duration of infusion to deliver this dose has not been clearly established and ranged between 30 minutes and six hours in previous studies . The decision to deliver the in-fusion over 60 minutes was made on the basis of maintaining an adequate plasma concentration while minimizing adverse events which can occur with a rapid lidocaine administration.\n\n【19】Table 1. Pain levels pre- and post-lidocaine infusions according to pain source.\n\n| Source of pain  | Pre-lidocaine pain  | Post-1\\* lidocaine  | Post-2\"d lidocaine  | Post-3dlidocaine  | Maximum duration  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Source of pain  | level (NRS)\\*  | treatment pain level treatment pain level treatment pain level  |  |  | of relief  |\n| Midline thoracic region  | 6/10  | 6/10  | 6/10  | 6/10  | N/A\\*\\*  |\n| Lower extremities  | 8/10  | 8/10  | 8/10  | 1/10  | 2 weeks  |\n| Notalgia paresthetica  | 3/10  | 0/10  | 0/10  | 0/10  | 3 weeks  |\n\n【21】\\* NRS， numerical rating scale for pain； \\*\\* N/A， not applicable.\n\n【22】The use of intravenous lidocaine in pruritus has been limited to patients with renal failure undergoing hemodialysis and those with cholestatic liver disease . To our knowledge， no re-ports have been previously published that describe using intra-venous lidocaine for the management of NP； we performed a search in the PubMed database using keywords： notalgia pares-thetica， pruritus， intravenous lidocaine. The hypothesis concern-ing its efficacy relies on the fact that itch can be the sole mani-festation in a neuropathic state， which is what NP is believed tobe.Therefore， intravenous lidocaine treatments utilized in neu-ropathic pain may be of benefit. In the case presented， an im-portant decrease in the intensity of itch up to 90% in our patient was attributed to the property of lidocaine to decrease the af-ferent transmission of the pain as well as the itch impulse. The effect of the treatment was not sustained，however， and the in-tensity of the itch progressively returned to baseline after a peri-od of three weeks. The implication of this effect could represent the need for maintenance infusions at three to four week peri-ods or a transition to an oral form of lidocaine， in our patient.\n\n【23】Conclusions\n\n【24】In summary， we have reported a case of NP associated with spi-nal cord injury that responded to intravenous lidocaine treat-ment. The relief was temporary but significant for a three week period， with improved daily function. The exact pathophysiol-ogy of NP remains to be elucidated as well as the role of sys-temic lidocaine in the treatment of neuropathic itch.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

After admission， anterior com-pression was detected by X-ray， so lumbar spinal CT was performed. For ligament damage， emer-gency MR was performed. There was acute hematoma at 1 cm diameter， which began at the L3 ver-tebra superior surface and spread to L4 vertebra corpus； therefore the patient was informed and surgery recommended. The patient rejected the surgery， and medical management was designed. At day 45， lumbar MRI was performed. There was no evidence of traumatic epidural hematoma.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】The purpose of this study is to report a case with post-traumatic spinal epidural hematomas with normal neurologic findings and spontanecus regression.\n\n【6】key words： trauma · spinal epiydural hematoma · spontaneus resorbsion\n\n【7】Spinal subdural and epidural hematomas are blood collec-tion in subdural and epidural spaces， causing mechanical compression of the spinal cord. Bleeding is usually seen at thoracic and lumbar regions and can accur spontaneous-ly or with spinal trauma， anticoagulant thrombolytic treat-ment， bleeding diathesis or after lumbar puncture .\n\n【8】Initial symptoms can be local or radicular back pain. Cauda equina syndrome and paralysis of the lower extremity may occur according to width and localization of the hemato-mas. Deficits can accur in a short periad， but in some cas-es there may be no symptoms or findings.\n\n【9】In this case the traumatic spinal hematomas resolved spontaneously.\n\n【10】CASE REPORT\n\n【11】A. 45-year-old man was brought to the emergency depart-ment after falling from a height. In the first assessment， vi-tal signs were stable (blood pressure： 120/80， fever： 36.7， pulse： 74)； the patient was conscious and had no neurolog-ical deficit. Upon inspection there was minimal abrasion at lumbar areas and precision with palpation. Urgent blood tests and spinal X-ray were performed. No pathological find-ings were determined in urgent blood tests. In X-ray， an-terior compression was detected， so lumbar spinal CT was performed. Comminuted fracture was detected at L3 Ver-tebral corpus. For ligament damage， emergency MR was perfermed. There was acute hematoma at l cm diameter beginning at the L3 vertebra superior surface and spread to L4 vertebra corpus ； therefore the patient was informed and surgery recommended. The patient re-jected the surgery， and medical management was designed. Ten days later， there were no deficits detected at physicalexamination and no increase at compression in the X-ray. At day 45， lumbar MRI was performed； there was no evidence of traumatic epidural hematoma .\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n\n【13】Spinal epidural hematomas are seen with anticoagulant drugs， hemophilia A or B， spinal hemangiomas， trauma， sur-gery， or after percutaneous interventions to thoraco-lumbar areas . Spinal epidural hematomas occur at the pos-terior surface of the spinal cord because of the anatomical course of the venous plexus . Groen and Ponssen indi-cated that epidural hematomas were localized at posterior epidural regions in their series . Spontaneous epidural hematomas at lumbar regions are rare， and usually occur at thoracic regions . In Mahkam's 49-case serial there were5 cases with lumbar hematomas .\n\n【14】Clinical findings of spinal epidural hematomas are broad. Neurological examination can be normal， or back pain，pa-resis or paraplegia may present .\n\n【15】Some investigators suggest that the fragility of epidural ve-nous plexus should increase bleeding tendency. Epidural hematomas can be distinguished from subdural hemato-mas with MRI findings. Epidural hematomas have bicon-vex intensity at MRI . Epidural hematomas should be distinguished from epiduritis， neural cysts， metastatic tu-mors and discs . The treatment is perfomed due to neu-rological examination and radiological findings .Some authors suggest emergency surgery， planning the surgery time according to the lesion’s dimension and neurologic status. Age， sex， the position of the hematoma， and lesion dimension are unimportant for the postoperative treat-ment and prognosis.\n\n【16】Groen et al. evaluated 330 cases in their series， and suggest-ed that the patients'postoperative course correlates with preoperative neurological findings .\n\n【17】As a result， CT and MRI should be urgently performed for patients who come to the emergency department with back pain， paraparesis or paraplegia .\n\n【18】When our patient presented at the emergency department after trauma， we detected a traumatic epidural hematoma. We suggested surgery to this patient， who was neurological-ly stable. The patient rejected the surgery， so we planned medical management. MRI was performed after 6 weeks and there was no evidence ofhematoma. This case is inter-esting because traumatic epidural hematoma was treated with non-surgical management and had a good prognosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The patient collapsed while on the phone to the next of kin and stopped breathing. She was initially revived but suffered a cardiac arrest and died. At autopsy an undiagnosed adrenal pheochromo-cytoma was found.\n\n【2】Conclusions： When considering a diagnosis of anxiety and depression， medical causes of the symptoms must be excluded. Common conditions， such as thyroid disorders， stimulant abuse， asthma， cardiac arrhythmias， alcohol with-drawal and rarely pheochromocytoma， causing a similar spectrum of symptoms should be excluded by histo-ry and clinical examination.\n\n【3】Key words： phaeochromocytoma · anxiety ·depression\n\n【4】Phaeochromocytoma is a rare catecholamine-producing tu-mour with an annual incidence rate of 2 cases per 1 million per year in the general population . The incidence of pha-eochromocytoma in autopsy studies is under 0.1% and au-topsy studies have also shown that up to 50% of phaeochro-mocytomas are unrecognized . The tumour has protean manifestations， mimicking a variety of conditions， earning the title “great mimic\" and often resulting in erroneous and de-layed diagnosis， which if missed or not properly treated， will almost invariably prove fatal . Phaeochromocytomas are most frequent in individuals between 40 and 50 years， with very slight predilection in females. The tumours occur in all races， but have been predominantly reported in Caucasians. Phaeochromocytomas typically arise in the adrenal med-ullary chromaffin tissue but in about 15% of cases from ex-tra-adrenal chromaffin tissues. Those arising from extra-adre-nal tissue are commonly known as paragangliomas . Almost all phaeochromocytomas are abdominal tumours with >90%arising in the adrenal glands. Extra-adrenal phaeochromocy-tomas develop in the paraganglion chromaffin tissues of the sympathetic nervous system from the base of the brain to the urinary bladder .\n\n【5】An undiagnosed fatal case of Phaeochromocytoma in a patient with a 15 year history of anxiety and depression is presented.\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】A 36 year old female had been feeling unwell for 6 months， presented with cough and shortness of breath. She was giv-en antibiotics and the B blocker Propranolol. A few hours lat-er she contacted her next of kin and asked her to collect her children from school because she was not feeling well. During the phone conversation， the patient collapsed and the next of kin contacted the Emergency Services. When the ambulance officers arrived， they found her to be short of breath and blue. Her heart rate was 186/minute but blood pressure was ap-parently not recorded. She then stopped breathing while be-ing assessed and went into a cardiac arrest. She was success-fully resuscitated and taken to hospital where she went into another cardiac arrest， which was soon followed by profound metabolic acidosis，from which she did not recover. Death was attributed to acute cardiac failure due to a phaeochromocyto-ma crisis. Toxicological analysis showed blood propranolol lev-el of <0.1 mg/L (Therapeutic level 6-701 mg/L).\n\n【8】Her past medical history included “anxiety and depression” for approximately 15 years， for which she had been taking 100mg Sertraline per day. Her blood pressure，6 month earlier had been recorded at 146/103 mm/Hg， which was attributed toher anxiety and 3 months later her blood pressure had been found to be 140/80 mm/Hg. There is no record of blood pres-sure during the final event. Immediately prior to death she had been investigated for hiatus hernia.\n\n【9】At autopsy， an 80 mm cystic mass was found in the right adrenal gland . No other endocrine abnormali-ty was found. The heart showed left ventricular hypertro-phy， the lungs were markedly congested and oedematous and small amounts of straw coloured fluid were present in each pleural cavity. The liver was enlarged and appeared pale. The kidneys， ureters， bladder and genitalia were nor-mal. No Lymphoreticular， nervous system or musculoskele-tal system abnormality was detected. Microscopic exami-nation showed the tumour to be a phaeochromocytoma， which was confirmed by immunereactivity of the tumour cells for the neuroendocrine markers Chromogranin A and Synaptophysin. No other significant microscopic abnormal-ity noted in the deceased.\n\n【10】Patients with phaeochromocytoma may present with symp-toms of excess catecholamine production， such as hyperten-sion， headache， perspiration， forceful palpitations，tremor and facial pallor. This patient did not appear to show these symp-toms but if she did they must have been either very minor or misinterpreted as anxiety. These symptoms are often parox-ysmal， although sustained hypertension in between paroxys-mal episodes occurs in 50% of the patients . Hypertension is not recorded in deceased's notes. This raises the possibility that hypertension if present， would have been paroxysmal. Hypertensive crisis can lead to cardiac arrhythmias， myocar-dial infarction， and even death. This is the most likely expla-nation in the deceased. Approximately half of the patients with phaeochromocytoma are asymptomatic because their neoplasms are discovered in the presymptomatic state by ei-ther abdominal imaging for other reasons or genetic testing in at-risk family members . There is no family history in the current case and disease was not suspected， hence not investigated by imaging. The diagnosis of phaeochromocy-toma is established by biochemical testing to document ex-cess catecholamine secretion. Because the disease was not suspected during like not biochemical investigation were per-formed. In this case， the patient had been treated for anxi-ety and depression for 15 years and there was no history of high blood pressure. The first real presentation in this case was a fatal crisis.\n\n【11】Most phaeochromocytomas arise sporadically as an inciden-tal unifocal and unilateral adrenal mass. The majority of these neoplasms are potentially curable benign tumours but approx-imately 10% are malignant. Unfortunately， no other reliable clinical， biochemical， or histological features distinguish a ma-lignant from a benign tumours .\n\n【12】Although the tumour in this case was pathologically benign， its metabolic effects caused a fatal outcome.\n\n【13】Although the patient received the a blocker propranolol， post-mortem blood levels of propranolol were very low and propran-olol may not have contributed to death\n\n【14】Conclusions\n\n【15】Phaeochromocytoma is a very rare potentially lethal disease of many guises. These are variable and often non-specific symp-toms， leading to long time delays between onset and diagnosis. Hypertension is not always a feature and when present is may be episodic. Suspected cases should be investigated by measure-ment of catecholamines in 24 hour urine collection or in plasma. Although the usual manifestations of the disease are very well doc-uments， a fatal outcome in an otherwise well patient is not well documented. This case heights the fact that a tumour does not have to be malignant to cause a fatality. a blockers should not be prescribed in patients suspected of having phaeochromocytoma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

However， other less common conditions can lead to hyperammonemia in adults， such as fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma. Clinical awareness of hyperammonemic encephalopathy in patients with normal liver function is paramount to time-ly diagnosis， but understanding the underlying physiopathology is decisive to initiate adequate treatment for complete recovery.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 31-year-old male with fibrolamellar carcinoma and peritoneal carcinomatosis presented with rapid onset hy-perammonemic encephalopathy. Despite usual treatment for hepatic encephalopathy， his hyperammonemia was aggravated. A physiopathological pathway to encephalopathy resulting from hepatocellular dysfunction or portosystemic shunting was suspected and proper treatment was initiated， which resulted in complete remis-sion of encephalopathy. Thus， we propose there is a physiopathology path to hyperammonemic encephalop-athy in non-cirrhotic patients with fibrolamellar carcinoma independent of ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) mutation. An ornithine metabolism imbalance resulting from overexpression of Aurora Kinase A as a result of a single， recurrent heterozygous deletion on chromosome 19， common to all fibrolamellar carcinomas， can lead to a c-Myc and ornithine decarboxylase overexpression that results in ornithine transcarboxylase dysfunction with urea cycle disorder and subsequent hyperammonemia.\n\n【4】Conclusions\n\n【5】The identification of a physiopathological pathway allowed adequate medical treatment and full patient recov-ery from severe hyperammonemic encephalopathy.\n\n【6】MeSH Keywords： Ammonia · Brain Diseases， Metabolic · Liver Neoplasms·\n\n【7】Ornithine Carbamoyltransferase Deficiency Disease\n\n【8】Protein digestion results in the production of amino acids， which are metabolized by the liver by oxidative deamination or transamination into ammonia， which are then converted to urea and excreted by the kidneys. Any disturbance of this cy-cle may lead to hyperammonemia and as a result， hyperam-monemic encephalopathy (HE).\n\n【9】There are three well stablished physiopathological pathways that lead to disruption of the nitrogen excretion cycle. An ex-cessive nitrogen load， for instance in the case of gastrointes-tinal bleeding or urinary diversion， may oversaturate the he-patic metabolization capacity. Another pathway disruption is an inability of the urea cycle to metabolize a normal nitrogen load， as in hepatic failure or in specific enzymes deficiencies. Additionally， the nitrogen load coming from intestinal protein digestion may bypass the liver， which occurs with portosys-temic shunting .\n\n【10】The most common cause of hyperammonemic encephalop-athy is liver failure. Hepatocellular dysfunction and porto-systemic shunting are the most important causes of inabili-ty of the urea cycle to properly excrete nitrogen metabolites resulting in hyperammonemia in patients with cirrhosis . Nevertheless，there are many non-hepatic causes of HE relat-ed to inborn errors of metabolism， such as ornithine transcar-bamylase (OTC) mutation.\n\n【11】We present the case of non-cirrhotic patient with fibrolamel-lar hepatocellular carcinoma (FHC) who developed hyperam-monemia and encephalopathy despite having normal hepa-tocellular function. A physiopathological path involving an overexpression of Aurora Kinase A (AURKA) due to a hetero-zygous deletion on chromosome 19 (which is present in ev-ery FHC) is proposed.\n\n【12】Case Report\n\n【13】A 31-year-old male with no comorbidities and no risk factor for chronic hepatic disease presented with a history of three weeks of abdominal circumference enlargement. A comput-ed tomography (CT) disclosed a large 18 cm hepatic mass oc-cupying the right liver， as well as ascites and signs of carci-nomatosis . Serum bilirubin level was 0.9 mg/dL(reference interval： 0.2-1.0 mg/dL)， INR was 1.34 (reference interval： 0.8-1.2). He had normal hepatic enzymes at presen-tation. There were no stigmata of chronic hepatic disease at physical examination， other than ascites， that could be ex-plained by peritoneal carcinomatosis.\n\n【14】The patient underwent diagnostic laparoscopy and biopsy of the hepatic tumor， and peritoneal implants were obtained. A large hepatic mass was found on the right liver with signs of rupture. Ascites and carcinomatosis were also present. The left lobe was enlarged probably due to compen-satory hypertrophy as a result of the right portal vein tumor thrombosis. The non-tumoral liver was normal， with no signs suggesting chronic hepatic disease\n\n【15】The patient's postoperative period was uneventful and the patient was dismissed from the hospital two days after the procedure. Pathology identified hepatic fibrolamellar hepato-cellular carcinoma (FHC) with metastatic peritoneal seeding. Immunohistochemistry examination determined a profile con-sistent with FHC .\n\n【16】One week after surgery， he was admitted to the hospital due to vague symptoms such as fatigue and mild abdominal pain. Moderate ascites had returned. He presented no signs of in-fection or dehydration. Laboratory tests disclosed normal liv-er function， with serum bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL (reference interval：0.2-1.0 mg/dL)， INR 1.16 (reference interval： 0.8-1.2)， serum venous lactate 11 mg/dL (reference interval： 6.3-18.9 mg/dL). One day after admission， he presented with lethargy and con-fusion and was admitted to the ICU.\n\n【17】A head MRI disclosed no secondary malignancies， no signs of intracranial hypertension， and no other significant findings. Blood ammonia level was 204 mcmol/L (reference interval：9-30 mcmol/L). Usual treatment for hepatic encephalopathy was initiated with neomycin， lactulose， and L-ornithine-L-aspartate. A continuous 18-hour electroencephalography dis-closed lowered basic rhythm， frequent diffuse triphasic waves， and sporadic outbreaks of moderate amplitude theta waves， consistent with HE.\n\n【18】Despite initial therapy， blood ammonia level increased to 280mcmol/L and the patient presented with neurological deteri-oration and coma. He required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Hemodiafiltration and proper paren-teral nutrition were initiated. Despite all procedures to treat HE and continuous hemodiafiltration， his serum ammonia lev-el reached 312 mcmol/L.\n\n【19】At this time， as treatment was not achieving the therapeu-tic results expected， another physiopathological cause oth-er than the usual excessive nitrogen load， hepatic dysfunc-tion， and portosystemic shunting to HE was suspected. In fact， the reticulocyte production index was 0.5% (reference inter-val： 0.5-2.5%)， lactic dehydrogenase was 280 IU/L (reference interval： 105-333 IU/L) and the hematocrit was stable， sug-gesting there was no hemolysis secondary to portosystemic shunting. Moreover， hepatic function laboratory tests were stillbetween normal range and the compensatory hypertrophy of the left lobe as a result of tumor thrombosis of the right por-tal vein suggested healthy non-tumoral. hepatic parenchyma.\n\n【20】This led to the investigation of less common causes of hyper-ammonemia， such as a urea cycle disorder. Since ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency is the most common urea cycle enzymatic defect associated with late onset HE in adults without hepatic dysfunction， this diagnosis was suspected. As urinalysis disclosed very elevated orotic acid (10 mmol/mol of creatinine，reference interval： 0.4-1.2 mmol/mol of creatinine) and plasma amino acid chromatography revealed reducedcitruline (3.0 mcmol/L， reference interval 16-51 mcmol/L)， very low arginine (15.5 mcmol/L， reference interval 43-407mcmol/L) and reduced ornithine (19.0 mcmol/L， reference in-terval 15.0-80.0 mcmol/L)， confirming OTC deficiency， treat-ment with sodium benzoate (3 g) and arginine (3 g) admin-istered every four hours via nasogastric tube was promptly initiated. A multi-gene panel genetic testing for inborn errors of metabolism was performed and no mutations were ob-served . OTC gene was tested and was not mutated.\n\n【21】Within 18 hours， blood ammonia level had reduced to 107mcmol/L. As the conscious level improved， the endotrachealtube was removed. The patient was dismissed from the inten-sive care unit one day after， with no clinical signs of HE. After treatment was initiated， there were no more clinical episodes of encephalopathy and the patient’s neurological examinations were normal. Before hospital discharge， the patient had che-motherapy treatment with a multikinase inhibitor (sorafenib) and GEMOX (gemcitabine-oxaliplatin). After two months on chemotherapeutic treatment， an abdominal CT disclosed sta-ble disease.\n\n【22】Table 1. Immunohistochemistry profile of the hepatic tumor.\n\n| Antibody  | Clone  | Interpretation  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Ki 67  | 30-9  | Positive in 70%  |\n| Polyclonal CEA  | Polyclonal positive membranous  | Positive， membranous staining  |\n| CAM 5.2  | CAM 5.2  | Moderately positive， diffuse cytoplasmatic  |\n| Glypican 3  | GC33  | Positive， multifocal  |\n| CK19  | RCK108  | Negative  |\n| CK7  | SP52  | Positive， intense  |\n| Hepatocyte  | OCH1E5  | Intense positive， granular staining  |\n\n【24】Three months after the introduction of sodium benzoate and arginine， and adequate diet， without any other medical treatment for HE (i.e.，neomycin， lactulose， and L-ornithine-L-aspartate were discontinued)， even with ongoing chemotherapypattern， mild confusion， lethargy， and personality changes. There may be asterixis. However， HE can develop into sOM-nolence， disorientation， marked confusion， and even coma. If left untreated， it may lead to intracranial hypertension， sei-zures， and death .\n\n【25】Early diagnosis relies on measuring plasmatic ammonia level in suspected patients. Although plasmatic ammonia levels do not always correlate directly with the degree of encephalop-athy， subsequent dosages may be used to monitor treatment response， and clinical improvement usually accompanies de-creasing levels of blood ammonemia .\n\n【26】Image studies such as CT and magnetic resonance imaging(method of choice) may help stablishing diagnosis. Typical findings of hyperammonemia are hyperintense lesions in the globus pallidus . Other image study modalities， such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy， single-photon emission CT， and positron emission tomography may add some informa-tion on the degree of impairment of cerebral water hemosta-sis， metabolic changes， brain edema， and astrocyte dysfunction and contribute to assessment of the severity and prognosis of neurological impairment 小.\n\n【27】Another useful diagnostic modality is the electroencephalog-raphy. Common findings are abnormal power of theta activity in mild or latent encephalopathy and low mean dominant fre-quency identified by biphasic power spectrum (delta and theta peaks) or high power delta activity in more severe cases .\n\n【28】As long as the diagnosis HE persists， proper treatment must be initiated， and it depends of identifying and understanding the myriad of conditions and physiopathological pathways that may lead to HE in patients with normal liver function.\n\n【29】Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma is a rare tumor of un-known etiology that almost always arises in non-cirrhotic liv-ers of young adults without chronic viral hepatitis. It was first described in 1956 by Edmonson as a subtype of hepatocel-lular carcinoma . Since 2009， this specific type of hepat-ic tumor has been associated with hyperammonemia in the literature.\n\n【30】There is no consensus in the literature about the exact caus-ative physiopathological mechanism of hyperammonemia in patients with FHC. Some authors propose that a portosystem-ic shunt resulting from large tumors occupying significant por-tions of the liver may impair the hepatic capacity of nitrogen waste clearance 13，14.\n\n【31】However， despite the fact that our patient had an 18 cm tu-mor occupying almost the entire right hepatic lobe with tumor thrombosis of the right portal hepatic veins， the left hepaticlobe was substantially enlarged probably as a result of com-pensatory hypertrophy. This compensatory hypertrophy of the left liver along with normal reticulocyte production index， se-rum lactic dehydrogenase， unconjugated bilirubin， and sta-ble hematocrit suggested no significant portosystemic shunt bypassing the liver. It also demonstrated regenerative capac-ity of the non-tumoral liver that requires healthy parenchy-ma. Pathological examination of the liver from biopsies that were performed during the exploratory laparoscopy showed no signs of chronic hepatic disease and there were no labora-tory or physical signs of hepatic failure. All these factors raise questions regarding why the liver lost only the capacity to per-form nitrogen waste clearance and no other energy consum-ing metabolic pathways were affected.\n\n【32】Another explanation to hyperammonemia in patients with he-patic cancer is chemotherapy-related toxicity . Several chemotherapy agents have been associated with HE， such as oxaliplatin， vincristine， 5-fluorouracil， cyclophosphamide， meth-otrexate， etoposide， and gemcitabine . Nevertheless， our pa-tient had never received chemotherapy before developing HE.\n\n【33】As previously reported in the literature， a more convincing ex-planation to the development of HE in patients with FHC is a disorder in the urea cycle . The urea cycle (also known as ornithine cycle) was described by Krebs and Henseleit in1932， being the first metabolic cycle discovered . It is re-sponsible for converting waste nitrogen from protein diges-tion and protein catabolism into urea， which is than excreted by the kidneys. The urea cycle consists of five consecutive re-actions， two mitochondrial and three cytosolic， and converts one amino group from ammonia， two molecules of nitrogen from ornithine， and one molecule from aspartate to urea. Two transporters (citrin and ornithine transporter-1) and a cofac-tor enzyme (N-acetyl glutamate synthetase) are also involved in the urea cycle . Therefore， a total of eight enzymes are involved is this metabolic cycle：\n\n【34】\\- N-acetylglutamate synthetase (NAGS)；\n\n【35】\\-Carbamoy.phosphate synthetase (CPS1)；\n\n【36】\\- Citrin (aspartate glutamate translocase)；\n\n【37】\\- Argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS)；\n\n【38】\\- Argininosuccinate lyase (ASL)；\n\n【39】\\- Arginase (ARG)；\n\n【40】\\- Ornithine translocase (ORNT1)；\n\n【41】\\- Ornithine transcarboxylase (OTC).\n\n【42】Disorders in the urea cycle are deficiencies of any of these factors and result in the accumulation of ammonia and other precursor metabolites. In fact， OTC deficiency has been pre-viously associated with FHC . However， the specif-ic reason for the suppression of OTC enzyme activity or for a deficiency of ornithine availability and consequent decreased ornithine cycle functioning has never been determined .\n\n| ABCC8，ABCD1，ACADM，ACADVL， ACAT1，AGL，ALDH7A1，ALDOB，ARG1，ARSA， ARSB，  |\n| --- |\n| ASAH1，ASL， ASS1，ATP7A，ATP7B， AUH，BCKDHA，BCKDHB， BCKDK， BTD，CBS，CQQ2，C0Q9，CPS1，  |\n| CPT1A，CPT2，CTNS，CYB5A，CYB5R3，CYP11B1，CYP17A1，CYP21A2，CYP27A1，DBT， DLD， ETFA，  |\n| ETFB，ETFDH，ETHE1， FAH，FBP1，FOLR1， G6PD，GAA， GALE，GALK1， GAT， GAMT， GATM，  |\n| GBA，GBE1，GCDH，GCH1， GCK，GLA， GLB1， GLUD1， GUSB，GYS2，HADH，HADHA， HADHB，HGD，  |\n| HLCS，HMGCL，HMGCS2，HPD，IDS， IDUA，INSR，IVD，KCNJ11，LIPA，LMPRD1，MMAA，MMAB，  |\n| MMACHC，MMADHC， MOCS1，MPI，MTHFR，MTR，MTRR， MUT， NAGLU， NAGS，NPC1，NPC2，OTC，  |\n| OXTC1，PAH， PCBD1，PCCA， PCCB， PDSS1， PDSS2，PHGDH，PHKA2，PSAT1，PSPH，PTS，PYGL，  |\n| QDPR，SGSH，SI，SLC16A1，SLC19A2， SLC19A3，SLC22A5，SLC25A13，SLC25A15，SLC25A20，SLC2A1，  |\n| SLC2A2，SLC37A4， SLC46A1，SLC52A2，SLC52A3，SLC7A9，SMPD1，SPR，TAT，TCN2，TH，TTPA.  |\n\n【44】The answer to that question probably began to be solved in1972 by Weber and colleagues . They demonstrated in rats a decrease in OTC activity reaching 1% of that observed in normal livers of control animals parallel to the increase in the hepatomas growth rate. This decrease had a close link to the increase in hepatomas growth rates， thus providing support to the Molecular Correlation Concept described by Weber and Lea . A decrease in the urea cycle functioning determined by the reduction on OTC activity results in a decline in the uti-lization of aspartate and carbamoy! phosphate that could be spared for biosynthesis of DNA and RNA and thus become a biological advantage to the hepatic tumors.\n\n【45】It was also demonstrated that， despite the fact that OTC is not a rate-limiting enzyme of the urea cycle， its metabolic lo-cation in the cycle puts it in competition with other enzymes that use ornithine as a substrate. This has been shown to be the case with ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) .\n\n【46】Ornithine decarboxylase catalyzes the decarboxylation of or-nithine， which is the first rate-limiting and committed step in polyamines synthesis， particularly for putrescine， spermine， and spermidine molecules that are indispensable for mam-malian cell growth. They are key substrates for DNA stabiliza-tion and repair and are important antioxidants. So， ornithine decarboxylase activity is essential for cell growth and the re-duction of this enzyme may induce apoptosis in DNA damaged cells . Weber et al. also demonstrated an imbalance in the activities and ratios of OTC and ODC. While in normal rat liv-ers the OTC activity is very high compared to ODC， in hepa-tomas there is a proportional reduction on OTC parallel to in-crease in ODC activity . Thus， the ratio of activity of ODC/OTC rise along with the increase in hepatomas growth rates， resulting in an augmented utilization of ornithine for polyamine synthesis and the resulting nucleic acid biosynthesis by hep-atoma cells. This imbalance becomes progressively increased parallel to the tumor growth rate， as showed by the Molecular Correlation Concept of an imbalance in enzymatic activities in opposing and competing metabolic pathways involved in tu-mor growth . Therefore， in contrast to recent publications on the association of FHC and HE that focused on a probable paraneoplastic effect of the tumor on the direct reduction onthe activity of OTC， the hypothesis is that an augmented acti-vation of ODC results in the consumption of ornithine， and re-sulting urea cycle disturbance . However， the reason for this ODC activation is still missing in this clinical scenario.\n\n【47】This takes us back to the characteristics of the FHC itself. The etiology of this tumor is unknown and there is limited data on its pathophysiology. Elevations on blood alpha fetoprotein in patients with FHC are less likely to occur than in patients with traditional hepatocellular carcinoma and the genome sequencing of such tumors (mutations， pathways and structural variants) have demonstrated that it is in fact a distinct disease .\n\n【48】The analysis of fresh frozen specimens of FHC has demonstrat-ed the presence of a single， recurrent heterozygous deletion of chromosome 19 that resulted in a functional chimeric protein of the heat shock protein DNAJB1 and a catalytic subunit of protein kinase A， PRKACA . This finding was very sen-sitive and specific (100% of the FHC presented this chimeric transcript) for this tumor .\n\n【49】The lack of a high background of mutations throughout the genome of this tumor and the absence of an identifiable sec-ond hit mutation necessary to carcinogenesis suggests that the chimeric DNAJB1-PRKACA kinase is necessary and prob-ably sufficient for the tumorigenesis of FHC . The most probable molecular pathway involved is that of the DNAJB1-PRKACA chimera， which results in changes of AURKA expres-sion within the tumor . Transcriptome sequencing has demonstrated increased expression of AURKA (a known on-cogene) in FHC samples .\n\n【50】It has been previously demonstrated that AURKA accumulations in the nucleus of hepatocellular carcinomas upregulates c-Myc transcription by binding to its promoter， which contains a high conserved CCCTCCCCA in the NHE region of CpG islands . C-Myc is a regulator gene that codes a multifunctional nucle-ar phosphoprotein that is a transcription factor of paramount importance to cell cycle progression， apoptosis， and cellular transformation. It was first described in patients with Burkitt lymphoma . A persistent expression of c-Myc leads to over-expression of many genes involved in cellular proliferation， re-sulting in carcinogenic effects . AURKA and c-Myc mediate each other's expression at the transcriptional level， affecting cellular proliferation， growth， and ATP production， and playing an important role in the carcinogenesis of hepatic tumors . So， increased expression of AURKA correlates with that of c-Myc.\n\n【51】Finally， one of the c-Myc oncogene targets is ODC . Overexpression of ODC secondary to c-Myc signaling result-ing in increased polyamines has been observed in many tu-mors samples and is one of the first and most important car-cinogenic steps in a variety of cancers .\n\n【52】To summarize， a recurrent heterozygous deletion of chromo-some 19 common to all FHCs results in an increased expres-sion of AURKA. This leads to an overexpression of c-Myc that upregulates ODC function that consumes ornithine in poly-amines synthesis. The consequence is a reduction on intracel-lular ornithine bioavailability and consequent decreased urea cycle functioning resulting in HE.\n\n【53】In our particular patient， a multi-gene panel genetic testing for in-born errors of metabolism was performed，including the OTC gene， and no pathological variants were observed . He also presented very elevated plasmatic histidine level (451.0 mcmol/L reference interval 6.0-250.0 mcmol/L) and low serine plasmat-ic level (19.0 mcmol/L，reference interval 20.0-120.0 mcmol/L) that could be indicative of ODC overexpression.\n\n【54】As the fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma presents in-creased expression of AURKA， the chemotherapeutic regimen option for this patient was sorafenib (a multikinase inhibitor) and GEMOX. Two months after beginning chemotherapy， a CT of the abdomen and thorax disclosed stable disease. Fourmonths after the acute encephalopathy episode and treatment with sodium benzoate and arginine was introduced， ammonia blood levels remained low and there were no other signs of HE.\n\n【55】Conclusions\n\n【56】Hyperammonemic encephalopathy in patients with normal he-patocellular function is a potentially fatal complication of rap-idly growing liver tumors. A high level of suspicion is neces-sary to prompt diagnosis， and adequate treatment relies on the proper understanding of the physiopathological mech-anism involved in order to reach complete remission of en-cephalopathy. We advise that all patients with large hepatic tumors should have ammonia blood level dosed at initial eval-uation and repeatedly during treatment. We propose that an overexpression of AURKA， which occurs in all FHCs， is the ini-tial key event that results in ornithine metabolism imbalance that leads to a urea cycle disorder resulting in hyperammone-mia and encephalopathy.\n\n【57】We want to thank Valdemir Carlos Moraes de Menezes and Erica Santos Flora da Silva for the continuous and relentless support.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The mech-anism of injury is usually associated with vascular and organ damage， and the course is dynamic， with high morbidity and mortality. Post-traumatic presence of glass pieces in the peritoneal cavity after an old impale-ment injury is rare.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 52-year-old woman sustained a 4-cm laceration in her lumbar region after falling on a glass table that shat-tered. After a physical examination and wound exploration in the emergency room， no foreign body was found. The laceration was sutured without X-ray imaging. She was admitted to the Surgical Department 9 months lat-er for diagnosis of lower abdominal pain. In a CT scan of the abdominal cavity a 19-cm fragment of glass was found intraperitoneally， inter-looped in the pelvic cavity. A laparotomy was performed， during which the foreign body was found and removed. No abdominal organs were injured. Further outpatient treatment was normal.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】Potentially minor abdominal impalement injuries can cause serious organ damage. Every patient， even if as-ymptomatic， and even after trivial injury with a small skin wound， must be suspected of having a hidden for-eign body. Accurate visual， manual， and instrumental wound exploration is always necessary. Imaging exams are an important diagnostic method when the presence of a post-traumatic foreign body is suspected.\n\n【6】MeSH Keywords： Foreign Bodies · Glass · Wounds and Injuries\n\n【7】Intra-abdominal impalement injuries are rare and often fa tal . The extent of damage caused depends on the energy of the injury， the track of penetration， and the structure and size of the foreign body . This mechanism of injury has a high rate of serious complications， such as damage to major ves-sels， gastrointestinal tract， and genitourinary system， as well as infections. Deep wounds can cause life-threatening bleed-ing . Therefore， in most cases， acute symptoms occur short-ly after the event. Extremely rare cases of long-term presence of a post-traumatic foreign body in the abdomen after an im-palement injury have been reported. We report a case of pel-vic and abdominal trauma caused by a sharp glass shard， in which the patient had no specific symptoms. Nine months af-ter the initial injury， the patient only had periodic hypogas-trium and hip pain.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】In September 2018， a 52-year-woman fell on a glass table， which broke into pieces， causing her to fall on the broken glass. She sustained a 4-cm laceration on the left lower lumbar region as a result of the fall. Soon after the incident， she was seen in the Emergency Department. The medical documentation from that hospital visit is scant. The patient was discharged from the Emergency Department less than 1 hour after arrival.\n\n【10】No surgical consultation was documented. According to the patient， a physician performed an inspection of the laceration and no foreign body was found. No additional imagingexams were performed. The wound was washed with antiseptic and sutured. An anti-tetanus injection was administered. During the next 9 months， due to persisting pain of the right hip，she was seen by several doctors， including an orthopedist， who performed an X-ray of the right hip . The radiolo-gist and orthopedist reported no abnormalities in the exam-ination. The patient was next referred to a doctor of physio-therapy and was qualified for physiotherapy treatment. Before starting the treatment， the patient's GP decided to refer her to a surgeon. In May 2019， she was admitted to our Surgery Department for an abdominal CT scan. The patient was a reli-able source of information without a prior history of any men-tal health diseases. Her past medical history included hyper-tension， well-controlled asthma， and overweight， with a body mass index of 26. She had no melena， vomiting， or gross he-maturia. An abdominal examination revealed palpation pain in the right hypogastrium， a protrusion in the right groin， and a scar on the left side of the lower back . The CT scan  showed the presence of a foreign body(190x38 mm and 11 mm thick) located in the pelvic cavity between the intestinal loops， running from the left hip bone obliquely downwards， anteriorly to the bladder， superiorly fromThe patient was qualified for elective laparotomy. Before the surgery， she had an indwelling catheter inserted into the blad-der， and tetanus prophylaxis was administered. The abdom-inal cavity was opened through a lower median incision andinspected. A large fragment of glass was found in the pelvic cavity， surrounded by granulomatous tissues. Upon further investigation， no localized peritonitis or organ damage were noted. The foreign body was removed without complications. The operative field was irrigated with saline solu-tion. There were no complications in the postoperative period.\n\n【11】She was discharged home on the 4h postoperative day. Further outpatient treatment was normal.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Foreign bodies may be found in the peritoneal cavity after im-palement injuries， abdominal surgery， or translocations from the visceral lumen due to long-term migration or perforation of swallowed objects or those inserted via the rectum. The over-whelming majority of such cases involve ingested foreign bod-ies such as toothpicks or chicken bones . Chronic perforationis most often caused by blunt foreign bodies and usually oc-curs in the sigmoid colon . Intrauterine contraceptive de-vices have been reported to migrate through the uterus in-traperitoneally .\n\n【14】Impalement injuries are one of the most difficult challenges for trauma surgeons due a high incidence of visceral or vascu-lar injuries with significant morbidity and mortality . Visible post-traumatic foreign bodies in the wound， hemodynamic in-stability， deterioration of the patient， and bleeding all raise con-cern of an intra-abdominal process and surgical exploration is needed. After the event， our patient was stable. She had slight pain， and a small wound without significant bleeding and the foreign body was not physically detectable. Although a 19-cm sharp glass fragment was in the peritoneal cavity for 9 months， there was no organ damage or migration. Such a case is high-ly unusual because most impalement injuries present acutely severe pain and injury to intra-abdominal structures.\n\n【15】In the literature， we only found 4 other cases of long-term pres-ence of a piece of glass in the peritoneal cavity with delayed presentation after an impalement injury  . All described cases had a common mechanism of injury-impact on a stationary object (type l by clinical classification of im-palement injury) . In our case and 2 other cases， the pa-tient fell on a glass table and suffered a small wound in the back. Probably， the structure of the broken glass in the formof a sharp triangular fragment facilitated deep penetration into the body. After the event， patients were in good condi-tion and did not raise suspicion of serious abdominal injury. Unfortunately， physical examination and wound exploration were insufficient to identify a foreign body， and only diagnos-tic imaging prompted by chronic abdominal pain showed the presence of a foreign body.\n\n【16】Table 1.

In 1 patient， delayed closure of a colonic perforation with a linear stapler without resection was performed  and the late results were good.\n\n【19】Our case is unique because of 3 features. First， the mecha-nism of the injury is extremely rare. Second， the symptoms that were seen for 9 months after the injury where very unspecific and slight， and the patient only had chronic lower abdominal pain. Third， the piece of glass left the organs and blood ves-sels undamaged， although it is the largest piece of glass de-scribed in the literature that remained long-term in the peri-toneal cavity without any organ damage.\n\n【20】Even a small torso wound in an asymptomatic patient must be suspected of having a foreign body and serious visceral injury. In any such case， visual， manual， and instrumental wound exami-nation is always necessary. Ifexploration of the wound is trou-blesome and painful for the patient and full accuracy cannot be guaranteed， the procedure should be performed under anesthe-sia. Imaging tests are an important diagnostic method when a post-traumatic foreign body is suspected， especially when the fascia is damaged. Radiological diagnostics is also needed as a check for residual foreign bodies after cleaning the wound.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Previous disease history includes gastric ulcer， which was treated with Helicobacter pylori eradication， and parox-ysmal atrial tachycardia for more than 40 years， which was managed using oral medication of pilsicainide hydrochloridehydrate， verapamil hydrochloride， and adenosine triphosphate disodium hydrate， only when a tachycardia attack persisted. Otherwise， he was nonsmoking， enjoyed running regularly(about 10 km/every 2 or 3 days)， and had a body mass index of 24. He had not had SARS-CoV-2 infection to date.\n\n【11】The patient received the first dose of intramuscular BNT 162b2anti-COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (EP2163， Pfizer-BioNTech) on March 9， 2021. He then experienced mild symptoms of sore-ness and redness at the injection site and myalgia lasting for more than 24 h. He had a fever of approximately 38C， which was managed through the oral intake of acetaminophen.On March 30， 2021， a second intramuscular injection of the anti-COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (EP2163， Pfizer-BioNTech) was admin-istered. This time， the fever was higher than the first， and fre-quent intake of acetaminophen was necessary. On December10， 2021， a third dose of the anti-COVID-19 mRNA vaccine(FJ5929， Pfizer-BioNTech) was administered intramuscularly. On that occasion， symptoms including swelling and redness at the injection site and fever were milder than those on the previ-ous 2 occasions， and were followed by an uneventful recovery.\n\n【12】Fifty-eight days after the third injection， discomfort from the upper abdomen to the right side of the abdomen was felt. Because the pain worsened and nausea emerged， the patient visited the Emergency Department. The systemic and neuro-logical examinations were unremarkable except for persistent epigastric pain. The patient had stable vital signs.\n\n【13】An abdominal dynamic CT angiography showed stenosis and dilatation of multiple visceral arteries， including the middle and right colic arteries . In the omental ar-teries， spindle-shaped dilatation and stenosis were identified. The left epiploic artery was not visual-ized， suggesting the development of occlusion due to arterial dissection .\n\n【14】Blood counts and the metabolic panel at the patient’s presen-tation showed no remarkable findings except for a slight el-evation of C-reactive protein (CRP) . The GeneXpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction assay (Beckman Coulter， Tokyo， Japan) yielded a negative result for SARS-CoV-2infection . A subsequent examination of vasculitis， thrombosis， and collagen disease screen showed no significant abnormal findings except for some minor changes . Further genetic diagnosis for collagen vascular disorders was not performed because no physical or laboratory findings in-dicated such a background. On magnetic resonance imaging angiography of the brain， abnormal findings of the blood ves-sels were unidentified.\n\n【15】Based on these findings， we diagnosed SAM of the multiple visceral arteries . Because the patient's vital condition wasstable， treatment by observation with restriction of daily living was chosen after the patient denied the recommendation to admit for observation. Then， the abdominal discomfort grad-ually lessened， without secondary attack.\n\n【16】On follow-up CT imaging， 21 days later， spontaneous resolu-tion of dilatation in the affected vessels was observed. Fifty-two days after symptom onset， a spindle-shaped aneurysmal structure was observed in the left gastric artery . From this point on， the restrictions on daily activities were stopped. Seventy-five days after symptom onset， aneurys-mal dilatation of the left gastric artery spontaneously subsided. Subsequently， the disease course was un-eventful， and observation was discontinued.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】SAM is a rare vascular disorder resulting from degeneration of the arterial media； its exact developmental mechanism is un-known . Serological examination does not usually show elevated inflammatory markers， including CRP and erythrocyte sedimentation rate . However， acute dissection or intra-ab-dominal hemorrhage in cases of SAM can cause a temporary(T)： higher than normal value； () lower than normal value.\n\n【19】Table 1.

In the present case， it was assumed that a slight CRP value elevation at triage could have been due to acute dissection and subsequent occlusion of the left epiploic artery.\n\n【26】In a surgically obtained SAM specimen ， the characteristic pathological findings of the affected vessel include lysis and vacuolization of the outer media originating from the arterial gaps and patchy transmural loss of the external elastic lami-na， followed by separation at the adventitial medial junction. Then， it is speculated that these changes can form aneurysms and dissecting hematomas due to weakening of the arterial wall， as was observed in the present case.\n\n【27】With the recent accumulation of conservatively managed cas-es without surgical excision ， the findings on CT imaging to characterize SAM are now becoming more important . They include arterial dilation and stenosis showing a “bead-ed\"appearance， dissecting hematoma，pseudoaneurysm， sin-gle or multiple aneurysms，end-organ ischemia or infarct， and rarely arteriovenous fistula ， some of which were observed in the present case.\n\n【28】Because of the low recognition and characterization of SAM， its true incidence has not yet been clearly demonstrated . SAM affects middle-aged and elderly patients， with a median age at onset of 55 years， and tends to be slightly more com-mon in men. Abdominal pain， as observed in the present case， accounts for approximately 10% of presenting symptoms of SAM in the emergency department .\n\n【29】However， SAM presents diagnostic and therapeutic challenges because various infectious， inflammatory， neoplastic， obstruc-tive， and idiopathic disorders must be excluded. Among vas-cular disorders， the principal differential diagnoses of SAM， fi-bromuscular dysplasia， which usually lacks symptoms， is more common in young patients and predominantly involves the re-nal arteries and polyarteritis nodosa .\n\n【30】Although new antivirals， including nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir(Paxlovid； Pfizer， New York， NY， USA)， have been approved now for COVID-19 infection， it is still believed that the best strate-gy to terminate the pandemic depends on timely and appro-priate immunizations worldwide . Because the efficacy and safety of anti-COVID-19 vaccines were shown in the registra-tion trials， their benefits are believed to outweigh the poten-tial risk of complications.\n\n【31】Nevertheless， the anti-COVID-19 mRNA vaccine was developed faster than any vaccine in the past (thanks to the collabora-tion between researchers， scientists， manufacturers， and dis-tributors in a never-before-seen approach)， and it should be cautioned that immunization with limited experiences such asthis can induce unexpected de novo vaccine-related disorders， including autoimmune diseases， particularly in predisposed in-dividuals . Furthermore， in addition to complications with a relatively clear causal relationship occurring in the early pe-riod after vaccination， associated morbidities manifesting in later periods with less unclear causal relationships should be carefully monitored.\n\n【32】In conjunction with the SARS-CoV-2 infection or anti-COVID-19vaccination， vascular disorders have been recognized as or-gan-specific immune-mediated complications， and the num-ber of reported cases is increasing .\n\n【33】A recent report has shown that spontaneous dissection of vis-ceral arteries without aortic involvement， which shows a sim-ilar clinical presentation to SAM， has occurred after anti-COV-ID-19 mRNA vaccination  . Furthermore，spontaneous pseudoaneurysm of the visceral artery with rupture after an-ti-COVID-19 mRNA vaccination has been presented . In these cases， the potential association of vascular disor-ders with anti-COVID-19 mRNA has been discussed， although rare coincidences are undeniable .\n\n【34】Vascular complications can occur early after the onset of COVID-19 or anti-COVID-19 vaccination， at less than 2 weeks apart . Alternatively， the complications can manifest lat-er during the course of the disease or vaccination， as in the present case， and can be associated with significant morbidi-ty. Although the determination of the causality or coincidence between a COVID-19 infection or vaccination and vascular dis-orders is extremely difficult to ascertain， it has been suggest-ed that both possibilities should be included as potential risk factors causing or promoting systemic vascular disorders .\n\n【35】The developmental mechanisms of COVID-19-related vascular disorders remain unelucidated . It has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2re-ceptors expressed on endothelial cells of the arterial wall by using surface spike proteins. Despite the controversy about whether this binding of the spike protein can lead to direct vi-ral infection of the endothelial cells， the binding can eventually result in the dysfunction of the endothelial cells through dam-age. Furthermore， a suggestion has been made that SARS-CoV-2infection can also induce giant cell arteritis .\n\n【36】Because all these mechanisms can also play a similar role in the development of anti-COVID-19 mRNA vaccine-associated vascular disorders ， it could be wondered whether the an-ti-COVID-19 mRNA vaccine， which allows for the endogenous production of the viral spike protein， has induced any type of arterial wall injuries. Alternatively， it could be hypothesized that bystander hyperactivation of the immune surveillance system， molecular mimicry， neoantigen production， and disturbance ofimmunological tolerance play a substantial role in triggering and developing vascular disorders .\n\n【37】Table 3.

Given the rare manifestation of SAM and its chronological relationship to the third dose of anti-CO-VID-19 mRNA vaccination in the present case， we still wonder whether SAM or mimics might have been related to the anti-COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in our patient's case. However， to date， such reported cases are limited in literature .\n\n【40】It is understood that there is the possibility that the patient in the present case may have had a previously undiagnosed SAM by chance， which subsequently resulted in the eventu-al formation of arterial dissection of the visceral arteries fol-lowed by occlusion by coincidence， without an unknown trig-ger at present.\n\n【41】Current information on the risk of vascular disorders due to anti-COVID-19 mRNA vaccination remains controversial. Thus. our experience concerning the development of SAM after an-ti-COVID-19 mRNA vaccination was presented in this case re-port. In fact， it is not our intention to deny the benefit of mass anti-COVID-19 vaccinations in preventing potential morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19.\n\n【42】We hope that this case of the relationship between anti-Co-VID-19 vaccination and SAM will add to the literature on the various potential manifestations and complications either in\n\n【43】Conclusions\n\n【44】SAM is a potentially life-threatening rare condition charac-terized by the disruption of visceral arterial media. While it could all be a rare coincidence， reporting such adverse events regardless of any potential causality will help add to the body of literature that is important for phase Ⅳ post-market sur-veillance to monitor for any late adverse complications relat-ed to anti-COVID-19 vaccines.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Mucormycosis has a very high mortality rate， especially among immunocompromised individuals. Due to the morbid and progressive nature of opportunistic fungal infections， early diagnosis is paramount for effec-tive disease management. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI) and Sanger sequencing are useful methods for rapid diagnosis of unusual fungal pathogens.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】We report a fatal case of mucormycosis caused by A. etegans in an immunocompromised man. The pathogen was isolated from a large nasal septal black eschar that developed rapidly during tooth extraction in a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome and diabetes mellitus. After unsuccessful identification by conventional meth-ods， A. etegans was identified using MALDI and Sanger sequencing\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】Diagnosing fungal organisms poses many difficulties， but amidst the technological evolution in pathogen iden-tification， there are useful methods for rapid identification， including MALDI and sequencing. With these power-ful tools， earlier diagnosis will give health professionals an advantage against potentially fatal fungal infections.\n\n【6】MeSH Keywords： Mucormycosis· Myelodysplastic-Myeloproliferative Diseases · Sequence Analysis， DNA·\n\n【7】Spectrometry， Mass， Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-lonization\n\n【8】The genus Actinomucor belongs to the phylum Zygomycota and order Mucorales. The pathological agent in this case， A. ele-gans， is ubiquitous in nature . Many Zygomycetes， includ-ing A. elegans， are used in soy fermentation as a source of fla-vor and texture . In a review of Mucormycetes from global and regional studies， it was shown that Rhizopus，Mucor，and Lichtheimia accounted for almost 80% of reported cases. However， there are still a large number of cases involving less common Mucomycetes， such as A. elegans.\n\n【9】There have been 5 previous cases of A. elegans reported. These include an 11-year-old female with sinusitis ， a necrotic foot ulcer in a diabetic male ， a lethal case from combat trau-ma confirmed post-mortem ， a lethal infection from an arm wound in an immune-compromised man ， and a sinus infec-tion in a patient receiving high-dose corticosteroids after stem cell transplant . All cases received debridement and antifun-gal therapy for treatment. Dissemination was documented in2/5， and both cases were lethal. This is consistent with other mucormycoses， in which mortality is greater than 95% for pa-tients with disseminated disease . Early diagnosis and treat-ment are vital for control of infection and patient survival.\n\n【10】Case Report\n\n【11】A 70-year-old white man with a history of myelodysplastic syn-drome (MDS) and diabetes mellitus presented with a history of nosebleeds， recent weakness， falls， and tooth pain. He was previously treated for MDS with decitabine therapy and was on azacytidine (VIDAZA) at the time of presentation.\n\n【12】On admission， the patient was found to be hyperglycemic and was started on an insulin drip. An X-ray of the mandible showed a peri-apical abscess at the root of tooth #15， and the left mandibular molar had a large carious erosion involving the crown. Both teeth were extracted on the morning of admis-sion.Although the patient had experienced tooth pain for sev-eral months， dental care was delayed due to chemotherapy-induced leukocytosis. During tooth extraction， a black eschar rapidly developed on the hard palate . Although not draining， it was tender and grew in size during the procedure. Right periorbital swelling also developed during the procedure. Further examination identified an eschar extending into the nasal septum. A fungal smear was immediately performed on a swab of the septal eschar， revealing pauciseptate hyphae suggestive of a zygomycete and a budding yeast. The patient was then started on liposomal amphotericin B (Ambiosome)， posaconazole (Noxafil)， and micafungin (Mycamine). Magnetic resonance imaging of the head with contrast confirmed acuteinvasive fungal rhino-orbital sinusitis and revealed disseminat-ed multifocal mycotic emboli in the brain .\n\n【13】Two distinct fungal colony morphologies were identified in cul-ture on Sabouraud dextrose agar incubated at 30°C. Smooth colonies with \"feet\" developed after 24 hours and were quickly identified as Candida albicans. This is a common colonizer of the nose and was not thought to contribute to the disease in this patient. On day 3 of culture， a cottony mold with abundant aerial hyphae developed and quickly filled the plate by day 5. The mold was subcultured on day 3 to potato dextrose agar to promote spore production. Lactopheno. cotton blue tape preps of the mold and evaluation of sporangia were unable to iden-tify genus or species . Further analysis with MALDI-TOF identified the mold on day 5 as an Actinomucor species.\n\n【14】The definitive treatment for rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormyco-sis is extensive surgery， including enucleation and removal of nose/maxilla， along with combination antifungal therapy . Survival of patients with disseminated disease is less than5%. Our patient failed to improve with antifungals alone and had significant comorbidities， including poorly controlled DM and decreased immune function related to his MDS. Due to the poor prognosis of disseminated mucormycosis，the pa-tient and family decided to decline extensive and painful sur-gery and instead transferred the patient to comfort care. The patient died 1 hour later. It had been 14 days since the first symptoms appeared (nosebleeds) and 8 days since hos-pitalization and tooth extraction.\n\n【15】Phenotypic identification\n\n【16】Hyphal growth was white and fluffy， filling the plate by day 5. After 6 days of culture， the sample began to turn tan with slight browning at the top. Hyphae were noted to be broad and nearly aseptate. Septa were mostly found near the spo-rangiophores and as the hyphae aged. Sporangiophores dis-played multiple branches  and formed round sporangia that produced smooth， round sporangiospores. These spores were released when the sac dissolved， revealing the columella. Abundant branching rhizoids were observed， and they were not localized under sporangiophores. Unlike Lichtheimia， no apophysis or collaret were observed .\n\n【17】The procedure was performed according to the manufacturer's specifications using MALDI Biotyper Compass software (Bruker Daltonik). Extraction of fungal elements followed the protocol outlined by the NIH  and the data were compared to the NIH mold  library. Hyphae were analyzed on day 5of culture after unsuccessful identification by morphology. At the time of this analysis， there was only a single entry in the fungal database for comparison - A. elegans. We applied the standard cutoff values for interpretation of results where iden-tification of species cutoff is ≥2.0 and genus is 21.7. With a top score of 1.8， we reported“Actinomucor species\".\n\n【18】Genotyping\n\n【19】We identified Actinomucor elegans to the species level using Sanger sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and D1/D2 divergent ribosomal RNA genes. DNA was extract-ed using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit Tissue Protocol (QIAGEN， Hilden Germany). Target genes were amplified using HotStarTaq Master Mix Kit (QIAGEN， Hilden Germany)， ITS-2b and ITS-3a， and NL-2b， and NL-3a (IDT， lowa) primers according to the man-ufacturer's conditions. PCR products were bidirectionally se-quenced according to the manufacturer's instructions on an Applied Biosystems 3500 (Thermo Fisher Scientific， Waltham， MA). Sequencing results were aligned based on ITS and D1/D2nucleotide-nucleotide searches using the NCBI BLASTn algo-rithm.\n\n【20】Genotypic characterization.\n\n【21】BLASTn consensus results demonstrated a 100% match for A. elegans. The ITS amplicon showed greatest homology with A. elegans accession no. F176396， 100% (395/395 bp)； and A. elegans var. meitauzae accession no. AY492087，100%(395/395 bp). The D1/D2 amplicon showed greatest homol-ogy with A. elegans var meitauzae accession no.JN206492，100%(389/389 bp) and A. elegans var kuwaitiensis accession no.JN206493， 100%(389/389 bp).\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】Over the years， major advances in healthcare have led to an increase in numbers of immune-compromised individuals and a concomitant increase in life-threatening infections due to op-portunistic fungi . Mucormycosis is the second most fre-quent mold infection in immune-compromised patients and can progress rapidly in both immune-compromised and im-mune-competent individuals. Mortality rates are very high with54% overall mortality and 96% for disseminated infections . Unfortunately， high mortality and inadequate treatment persistdue to the difficulty of diagnosing mucormycosis . Early diagnosis， surgical debridement， systemic antifungal therapy， and control of underlying conditions are paramount to suc-cessful management of disease . While early diagnosis did not save our patient's life， it did allow the care team and fam-ily to make an informed decision to withhold painful surgical interventions for a patient with a poor prognosis due to dis-seminated infection.\n\n【24】This case report is the first to identify A. elegans after tooth ex-traction and the first to address early diagnosis through the use of MALDI， which is a fast， reliable， and cost-effective method for identifying microorganisms . It also highlights the util-ity of Sanger sequencing for fungal identification. Fungal se-quencing is currently underutilized in clinical settings. Diagnosis to the genus level of a lethal case of mucormycosis was ob-tained from an isolate in under 2 hours by MALDI， and iden-tification to the species level was possible 2 days later by se-quencing. Traditional phenotypic methods require 4 or more days for development of conidia， subjective identification of sporangia， and expertise in rare and unusual fungi. Microscopic evaluation alone was not sufficient to identify this pathogen in our institution. Early diagnosis could have aided in getting quicker antifungal susceptibility testing results. In our case， this testing was discussed but declined because it would not affect the family's decision to withdraw care. MALDl and se-quencing offer fast and less subjective diagnostic methods to provide clinicians and families with a complete diagnosis in an actionable amount of time. These techniques are broadly applicable to other fungi， which further suggests they should be routinely available in clinical labs.\n\n【25】Conclusions\n\n【26】This case offers multiple learning opportunities. Disease was first recognized in the unusual setting of tooth extraction when the black eschar on the hard palate rapidly developed during the procedure. The patient had a classic history for mucormy-cosis - sinus infection in a patient with diabetes and immune compromise. However， the etiologic agent was unusual and hard to diagnose. Through the use of MALDl and sequencing， the lab was able to overcome the limitations of subjective phenotypic methods and identified A. elegans as the cause of disease. Providing a complete diagnosis assisted the care team and family to make an informed decision regarding pa-tient management. With early detection， decreased delays in treatment could offer patients a greater chance for survival", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

FNAB smears dem-onstrated highly atypical squamous cells and a diagnosis positive for malignancy was rendered. CNB and a surgical resection specimen revealed invasive squamous carcinoma with keratin pearl formation and intercel-lular bridges. Further study demonstrated this was an unusual metaplastic SCC case with basal-HER2 (+) phe-notype. HER2 has been linked to poor prognosis and response to therapy\n\n【4】Conclusions： The pathological diagnosis of the breast metaplastic SCC was made initially by FNAB and CNB. Identification of basal-HER2 (+) phenotype was critical for selection of hormonal therapies and chemotherapy.\n\n【5】MeSH Keywords： Breast Neoplasms· Genes， erbB-2· Mass Behavior· Metaplasia ·Neoplasms， Squamous CellBreast squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a rare and aggressive neoplasm， and accounts for less than 0.1% of all breast car-cinomas . Metaplastic SCC refers to carcinoma that shows dominant areas of non-glandular squamous differentiation； other components could include ductal cells， spindle cells， chondrocytes， osteocytes， and striated muscle cells . The broad range of microscopic appearances of breast metaplastic SCCs has resulted in significant diagnostic challenges. Clinical and radiological signs of metaplastic SCC are also non-specific.\n\n【6】Overexpression of HER2， one of the transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors from the epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR) family， is uncommon in breast SCCs. Without targeted therapy， HER-2 overexpressing breast carcinomas are associ-ated with poor prognosis. Most breast SCCs， regardless of the type of metaplastic elements， are CK5/6， CK14 positive， and according to immunohistochemistry/gene profiling classifica-tion， belong to the basal-like phenotype . It has been as-sumed for a long time that HER-2 overexpression and basal-like breast carcinomas are mutually exclusive . This concept has been challenged recently and the basal-HER2 (+) pheno-type has been linked to poorer survival prognosis than either HER-2 overexpression or basal-like subtype . Breast carci-nomas of this phenotype benefit from anthracycline treatment and are resistant to trastuzumab or tamoxifen therapy .\n\n【7】In our case report， we reported a metaplastic SCC initially diag-nosed by fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) and core needle biopsy (CNB). Further excisional specimens showed the tumor overexpressed HER2. Thus， we reported a metaplastic SCC of extremely uncommon phenotype.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】In March 2017， a 48-year-old female patient presented with a painless rapidly growing palpable mass of about two months， in her right breast. Physical examination found a 4x4 cm mass in the upper-outer quadrant. There was no retracted nipple or orange-peel appearance of the breast skin. Enlarged lymph nodes were palpable under the right axillary area. Ultrasound diagnostic was a solid mass with cystic region in the right breast which was classified as BI-RADS 4C.\n\n【10】FNAB was conducted to aspirate cystic fluid with rapid on-site evaluation prior to a surgical procedure. The FNAB cy-tology smears demonstrated highly atypical squamous cells scattered with large amounts of erythrocytes and necrotic tis-sue . The tumor cells were scattered or loosely cohe-sive； with tadpole， irregular， or polygonal shape and rich， eosino-philic cytoplasm. Hyperchromatic， large， and pleomorphic nucleiwere identified with prominent nucleoli and coarse chromatin. Atypical mitotic figures and tumor giant cells were also observed. Some cells presented with denatured nuclei. The FNAB morpho-logical features rendered the diagnosis as positive for malignancy and consistent with SCCs. CNB specimen revealed ductal struc-tures with mostly benign metaplastic squamous cells； one core illustrated invasive squamous cell carcinoma with pleomorphic squamous tumor cells infiltrative to surrounding parenchyma. The moderately differentiated tumor contained regions of rib-bon-like architecture with polygonal cells， eosinophilic cytoplasm， keratin pearl formation， and intercellular bridges. Furthermore， there were areas with mixed ductal and squamous epithelial cells that demonstrated the metaplastic processing . The surgical resection specimen demonstrated a metaplastic SCC of 3.5×3.5x4.0 cm. Microscopically， the tumor was com-posed of moderate differentiated metaplastic SCC， confirming the findings of FNAB and CNB . The tumor cells were located near the base of the breast. Because of palpable swol-len lymph nodes， the axillary lymph node was removed. One out of 19 axillary lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcino-ma. Interestingly the metastatic carcinoma was breast ductal carcinoma in morphology ； the other lymph nodes were not involved. No tumor was found in the nipple nor skin.\n\n【11】Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed that the primary meta-plastic SCC was ER negative， PR negative， HER-2 positive (3+)， EGFR (1+)， CK5/6(2+)，34BE12(2+)，P63 positive (the P63 pos-itive cells were located around the cancer nest)， P53 negative， SMMHC positive (1+)， E-cadherin (2+)， and Ki-67 was positive in 95% tumor cells. The positive IHC images of HER2， CK5/6， and EGFR are presented in Figure 2.\n\n【12】After right modified radical mastectomy， doxorubicin， docetax-el， and cyclophosphamide (TAC) chemotherapy was selected for our patient； in addition， radiotherapy was selected because of lymph node involvement. The patient was asymptomatic and disease-free four months after surgical resection.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Primary metaplastic breast SCCs are uncommon， aggressive car-cinomas and their diagnoses can only be made after exclusion of SCCs from skin and other organ systems of the body such as oral cavity or esophagus. In addition， >90% of tumor cells are usually metaplastic squamous cells . Shuai et al. reported that SSC only account for 0.1% of all invasive breast carcinoma (30 out of 25，232 cases). The current  World Health Organization classification distinguishes five subtypes of metaplastic breast carcinomas .\n\n【15】Our case presented as squamous cell carcinoma. Etiology and pathogenesis of breast metaplastic SCC is uncertain .\n\n【16】In our case study， FNAB and CNB were taken prior to the sur-gical excision and the diagnosis of malignancy， consistent with SCC. The FNA exfoliative cytology smear presented squamouscarcinoma cells and this finding was further confirmed by CNB. It is important to note that the role of FNAB combined with CNB as a primary diagnostic tool for breast carcinomas is not settled. This is partly because a lot of breast carcinomas are well differentiated， and it can be difficult to differentiate var-ious atypical and metaplastic changes. In addition， it is diffi-cult to differentiate ductal carcinoma in situ or lobular carci-noma in situ from invasive carcinomas . However， our case report clearly demonstrated that FNAB combined with CNB was highly useful in diagnosing subgroups of breast car-cinomas， including metaplastic SCCs.\n\n【17】Lymph node involvement of breast metaplastic cancer is typi-cally lower than non-specific invasive breast cancer. However， Brenner et al. reported that local and/or distant metastases were observed in more than 50% of cases within five years of poor prognosis . Our patient presented with one out of 19axillary lymph nodes as metastatic and microscopically showed invasive ductal carcinoma. The components of the metastat-ic carcinoma matched with the surgical resection specimen， which contained mixed ductal and squamous epithelial cells and demonstrated metaplastic processing.\n\n【18】Only 15% to 25% of invasive breast cancers overexpressed HER2 . According to CK/TN classification ， breast car-cinoma can be divided into three subtypes based on five cy-tokeratin markers： basal (CK5/6， CK14， CK17)， luminal (CK8， CK18)， and null. It has been assumed for a long time that HER-2overexpression and basal-like breast carcinomas are mutually exclusive . This concept has recently been challenged， and the HER2+ cases have been further divided into three sub-types： luminal-HER2+ (ER+， basal CK-)； HER2+ (ER- and bas-al CK-)； and basal-HER2+ (ER-， basal CK+). Each subtype was correlated with clinical pathologic features， OS，and therapies. Our patient was ER negative， HER-2 positive (3+)， CK5/6(2+)， and EGFR(1+)， which was classified as basal-HER2(+) pheno-type. This was extremely unusual (only 9% of HER2+ cases) . Basal-HER2 (+) phenotype has been linked to poorer over-all survival compared with two other subtypes . Tumors of this phenotype benefit from anthracycline treatment and might be resistant to trastuzumab or tamoxifen therapy .\n\n【19】Conclusions\n\n【20】FNAB combined with CNB are useful diagnostic approaches for breast carcinomas， and accurate diagnosis of metaplastic SCC can be rendered. Immunohistochemically markers are es-sential and sufficient to subtype breast metaplastic SCCs. The basal-HER2 (+) phenotype is a rare case in metaplastic SCC； identification of it is critical for selection of hormonal thera-pies and chemotherapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

In cases of persistent cloaca， prenatal ultrasonography shows fetal ascites， cystic tumor in the abdomen， oligo-hydramnios， and hydronephrosis. There are various types of persistent cloaca， and symptoms vary.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 38-year-old pregnant woman was referred to our hospital because of suspected fetal expansion of the intes-tinal tract. Prenatal ultrasonography revealed a fetal growth restriction， oligohydramnios， fetal abdominal cyst， and bilateral hydronephrosis， and persistent cloaca was suspected. Also， magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a double uterus and bilateral hydronephrosis， hydrocolpos； as such， persistent cloaca was diagnosed. Cesarean section was performed at 36 weeks+3 days gestation and delivered a female infant weighing 1957g with Apgar scores of 9 (1 min)/9 (5 min).\n\n【4】Conclusions： We report a case of persistent cloaca detected in the prenatal ultrasonography and MRI examination. Prenatal diagnosis is important because it can lead to a better outcome for infants with persistent cloaca. In the image inspection in persistent cloaca， there are characteristic findings such as ascites， cystic tumor in the abdomen， difficulty in visualizing the bladder， oligohydramnios， and hydronephrosis. So， if persistent cloaca is suspected， use of ultrasonography and MRI will allow its diagnosis.\n\n【5】MeSH Keywords： Cloaca· Hydrocolpos · Prenatal Diagnosis\n\n【6】Persistent cloaca refers to anorectal malformations occur-ring in females. This is an extremely rare disease in which an abnormality in the formation of the urorectal septum at 5-8weeks' gestation causes the urethra， vagina， and rectum to merge into a common tube - a cloaca - that only opens into the perineum. There are various types of persistent cloaca， and symptoms vary. Accordingly， reported fetal ultrasound findings have included fetal ascites， cystic tumor in the abdomen， dif-ficulty in visualizing the bladder， oligohydramnios， and hydro-nephrosis/hydroureter . We report a case involving a pa-tient who underwent prenatal imaging and was diagnosed with persistent cloaca.\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】Expansion of the intestinal tract in the fetus was revealed on ultrasound at 35 weeks’ gestation， and the woman was re-ferred to us for more detailed examination. Fetal growth re-striction， oligohydramnios， fetal abdominal cyst， and bilateral hydronephrosis were observed， and persistent cloaca was sus-pected . Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a double uterus and bilateral hydronephrosis and hydrocolpos； as such， persistent cloaca was diagnosed . Due to fe-tal distress， an emergency cesarean section was performed at36 weeks+3 days gestation. The woman delivered a female in-fant weighing 1957 g， with Apgar scores of 9 (1 min)/9 (5 min). The external genitals of the baby were female. Imperforate anus and imperforate vagina were evident， and the urethral opening was unclear. The lower abdomen was remarkably dis-tended but no other external malformations were observed. At 1 day of age， a cystostomy and a double-hole colostomy were created in the transverse colon. A contrast radiography after birth visualized the site where the 3 tracts of the blad-der， hydrocolpos， and intestinal tract merged . In ad-dition， a distended bladder and double uterus and hydrocolpos were found intraoperatively in the abdomen， and persistent cloaca was confirmed.\n\n【9】Subsequently， the infant underwent laparoscopically-assisted rectoplasty and labiaplasty. She is currently undergoing regular check-ups at our Departments of Pediatric Surgery and Urology.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Persistent cloaca is a congenital anomaly in which the rectum， vagina， and urethra open into a common cavity due to ab-normal separation of a cloaca . A cloaca， which is a com-mon cavity into which the hindgut and allantois open， sepa-rates into the urodeum and rectum at approximately 6 weeks'gestation. Then， the Mullerian duct fuses with the mesoneph-ric duct to form the uterine tract and， at the perineum， the ure-thra， vagina， and rectum are formed. Cloacal anomalies are a disease state in which the developmental process is impaired， and results in persistent cloaca. The incidence rate is approx-imately 1 per 50 000 live births . The symptoms vary de-pending on the position of confluence， length of the common cavity， and other combined malformations. The higher the position of confluence， the more frequently dysuria/dysche-zia occur. Approximately 40% of patients develop combined double uterus and approximately 30-50% of fetuses present hydrocolpos .\n\n【12】In general， prenatal diagnosis of anorectal malformations is dif-ficult. Most cases of persistent cloaca present specific abnor-malities during a fetal period and， when cysts are observed in the lower abdomen， discrimination from expansion of the in-testinal tract，expansion of the renal pelvis and， in the case of a female fetus， ovarian cysts， becomes necessary. Bischoff et al. reported the frequency of abnormal prenatal ultrasound find-ings in patients with persistent cloaca as follows： abdominal cystic mass (41.1%)， hydronephrosis (37.9%)， oligohydram-nios (24.2%)， distended bowel (20%)， ascites (15.8%)， 2-vessel cord (14.7%)， dilated bladder (14.7%)， dilated ureter (14.7%)， polyhydramnios (10.5%)， echogenic bowel (8.4%)， multicys-tic kidneys (8.4%)， hydrops fetalis (7.4%)， hydrocolpos (4.2%)， absent kidney (3.2%)， abnormal spine (3.2%)， and anorectal atresia (3.2%) .\n\n【13】In general， only cystic pelvic masses in female fetuses are unlikely to be persistent cloaca. But， if there are 2 or 3 cyst structures， it is likely to be a persistent cloaca (bladder and hydrocolpos). Differential diagnosis of a female fetus with an abdominal cystic mass includes ovarian cysts， intestinal du-plication cysts， cystic lymphangioma， intestinal obstruction， and small cystic colon cystic small bowel syndrome. However， by confirming the location and number of cysts， meconium， and intestinal peristalsis， it can be distinguished from persis-tent cloaca. Ovarian cysts are the most common cystic lesions found in the female fetus， but the cyst is lateral， not near the midline. In addition， since there is no abnormality in the ana-tomical structure of the kidney and the intestinal tract， it can be distinguished from persistent cloaca. Duplicate intestines are usually isolated abnormalities， but the cyst walls are thick， with multiple echogenic walls and peristalsis. An isolated mid-line cystic mass in a female fetus is either the bladder or the hydrocolpos. The distinction between the bladder and vagina is possible by the presence or absence of paravesical vessels in color Doppler imaging. If the cyst is in the bladder， mega-cystis microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS) is also possible. The presence or absence of meconium in the rectum is useful for discrimination from MMIHS. Meconium is present in the rectum in MMIHS， but there is no meconiumin the rectum in persistent cloaca. If there are 1 or 2 cysts be-hind the bladder， suspect hydrocolpos due to persistent clo-aca. However， these may also be found in the genitourinary sinus with normal rectum or in a perforated hymen. In these diseases as well， there is meconium in the rectum in the geni-tourinary sinus and non-porous hymen， so it is possible to dis-tinguish it from persistent cloaca. Based on these facts， it is considered that discrimination is possible by observing the fol-lowing points carefully： 1) female fetus， 2) multiple cystic mass in the pelvis， 3) cysts near the median， and 4) no meconium in the rectum . In the present case， there were character-istic ultrasonographic findings such as abdominal cystic mass and hydronephrosis， oligohydramnios， hydrocolpos. In the fe-male fetus， there were multiple cysts near the median in the abdominal cavity， and the cloaca was easily shown by the ul-trasound image .\n\n【14】Characteristic imaging findings such as fetal ascites， cystic mass， insufficient amniotic fluid， and hydronephrosis show that refluxed urine flows into the abdominal cavity through the fallopian tube， resulting in ascites and obstruction of the fallopian tube due to chronic inflammation due to urine and meconium. In 1988， Petrikovsky and colleagues reported that urine and meconium accumulate in the vagina and uterus and cause hydronephrosis .\n\n【15】In fetal ascites in persistent cloaca， urine and meconium re-flux to cause meconium peritonitis. Moreover， the mixing ofurine and meconium results in calcification； therefore， intra-peritoneal calcified images may be observed .\n\n【16】Therefore， although it is relatively easy to find persistent clo-aca on ultrasound images， MRI may be helpful in diagnosis because it may show findings similar to those of other dis-eases. Fetal MRI has the advantage of facilitating the diagno-sis of persistent cloaca by defining the anatomy of the cloaca， urogenital organs， and intestinal tracts， and has been recog-nized as a useful complement to uitrasound. In our case，MRI was performed， and images of bicellular cysts， hydronephro-sis， and duplicated uterus were clearly shown， enabling diag nosis prenatally.\n\n【17】Fetal imaging assessment using ultrasound combined with MRI is important for prenatal diagnosis. In recent years， many stud-ies have reported use of prenatal MRI. MRI has been shown to be more useful for clear visualization of lesions in the pel-vis and screening for combined malformations than is ultra-sound .\n\n【18】The optimal management of pregnancy and timing and meth-od of delivery in cases of persistent cloaca have not been de-termined. When this disease is suspected，the case should be managed at a high-level facility with a department of pediat-ric surgery due to the possibility of other combined malfor-mations. Because a fetus may die in the uterus due to high-grade urinary obstruction ， and a newborn may die due to pulmonary hypoplasia and renal impairment caused byoligohydramnios ， mental health support is need-ed for the mother， in addition to the management of the fetus as a high-risk pregnancy . Although the prognosis of per-sistent cloaca is not poor， persistent cloaca involves complex malformations spanning the digestive organs and the urinary and genital tracts； thus， surgical treatment and management of newborns at specialized facilities are needed. Regarding the timing and methods of delivery， delivery at term is the goal when the fetus is in good condition. However， polyhydramnioscan cause threatened premature delivery， and premature rup-ture of the membrane can cause preterm delivery. Although vaginal delivery is the principle delivery method， in the case of an increase in the baby's abdominal circumference， oligo-hydramnios， or fetal growth restriction， cesarean section is considered. In the present case， fetal growth restriction and oligohydramnios were observed. Considering the possibility of fetal distress， the patient was hospitalized and managed.\n\n【19】Cloaca is a complex malformation that spans the digestive tract， urinary tract， and genitals and requires advanced management. Therefore， based on prenatal images， information was shared in collaboration with the Neonatology Department， Pediatric Surgery， and Urology Department. The management and treat-ment policy should be assessed in cooperation with related de-partments， and explanations of the disease and mental sup-port should be given to parents. In our case， the pregnancycontinued while carefully evaluating the fetus， but because of fetal bradycardia and fetal distress， an emergency cesarean section was performed. If fetal growth restriction and oligo-hydramnios are detected， it is considered a higher-risk case. After birth， a neonatologist， pediatric surgeon， and urologist manage the child as a team . Usually， drainage of hydrocol-pos is performed after birth because delaying treatment withhydrocolpos can cause urinary tract infection， pyocolpos， and vaginal perforation due to worsening urinary tract obstruction. In our case， remarkable bladder dilatation and dysuria in the common cavity were observed after birth. On the first day af-ter birth， a colostomy and vesica! fistula were performed. As a result， the ureteral compression by the expanded bladder and vagina was released， and the hydronephrosis was relieved. The bowel was dilated due to impaired defecation， and， if left untreated， abdominal distension and intestinal perforation can occur， which necessitates stoma construction after birth . The timing of radical surgery can vary； as such， the timing de-pends on the type of disease， length of the cloaca， and oth-er combined malformations. In our case， a postnatal contrast examination confirmed the urethra， rectum， and bilateral va-gina opening into the common cavity . The child un-derwent vaginoplasty 1 year after birth and laparoscopically-assisted rectoplasty 2 years after birth.\n\n【20】Accurate diagnosis before birth and confirming detailed pathol-ogy on fetal imaging findings are useful for perinatal manage-ment and contribute to appropriate explanations to the fam-ily and improved prognosis of the child.\n\n【21】We report a case of persistent cloaca detected by prenatal ul-trasonography and MRI examination. Persistent cloaca is an anorectal malformation occurring in females. Therefore， pre natal diagnosis is important and can lead to a better outcome for infants with persistent cloaca. Ultrasonography findings in persistent cloaca are ascites， cystic tumor in the abdomen， dif-ficulty in visualizing the bladder， oligohydramnios， and hydro-nephrosis. But these findings are also observed in bowel ob-struction and meconium peritonitis， so differentiating these conditions from persistent cloaca is difficult. However， if the fetus is a female and there are multiple cysts near the mid-line in the abdominal cavity， the possibility of cloaca is high， and detailed diagnosis by MRI can be made. In our case， both MRl and ultrasonography were performed， which facilitated the diagnosis. Our experience suggests that MRI is useful for accurately diagnosing fetal persistent cloaca.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Treatment consists of excision of the entire stom-ach. Malnutrition is a common problem in patients diagnosed with gastric cancer and has a negative impact on the course of treatment and the quality of life.\n\n【1】Case Report： The paper presents a case report of a patient after total gastrectomy performed on 11/04/2016 due to G3 mu-cocellulare carcinoma. The patient had been on home parenteral nutrition for 2.5 years due to chronic malnutri-tion. After this period of time， an attempt was made to introduce an exclusion diet with the addition of Modulen IBD (Nestle Health Science)， which is routinely used in the nutritional treatment of patients with Crohn’s dis-ease， with simultaneous discontinuation of parenteral nutrition.\n\n【2】After 3 months， the patient was readmitted to the hospital to assess his nutritional status. He continued the diet as recommended. He maintained his body weight and reported improvement in eating habits.\n\n【3】Conclusions： In the described case， the patient presented with symptoms of impaired bowel function resulting from long-term cessation of oral nutrition. It is possible that the nutritional and immunomodulatory effect of Modulen，in combination with the anti-inflammatory elimination diet， resulted in better nutrition of intestinal epithelial cells and gradual improvement ofintestinal motility and absorption， which in turn enabled the patient to com-pletely withdraw from parenteral nutrition. We propose that this type of nutritional management could also be considered in other cases of intestinal dysfunction.\n\n【4】Keywords： Postgastrectomy Syndromes· Malnutrition· Enteral Nutrition· Nutrition Disorders·\n\n【5】Nutrition Therapy\n\n【6】Gastric cancer is the 5th most common malignancy worldwide and the annual incidence is estimated at about one million cases . Surgery is the only radical treatment for advanced cancer， often in combination with chemotherapy or radiother-apy. The operation consists of excision of the entire stomach with as many lymph nodes as possible from the direct and dis-tant vicinity of the tumor . The gastrectomy procedure car-ries the risk of complications， of which the problem of mal-nutrition is very important from the point of view of further treatment and prognosis. Appropriate planning and monitor-ing of nutritional treatment is therefore a necessary element of holistic patient care.\n\n【7】Malnutrition is a common feature of patients diagnosed with gastric cancer， but cancer-related malnutrition is underestimat-ed and often untreated worldwide . Malnutrition has a neg-ative impact on the course of treatment and the quality of life of patients. It is estimated that 10-20% of cancer patients die as a result of malnutrition， not the tumor itself . Total gas-trectomy increases the risk of malnutrition due to early sati-ety and changes in dietary tolerance， among other post-gas-trectomy symptoms， resulting in unintentional weight loss as well as high risk of micronutrient deficiencies. Gastrectomy disrupts reservoir capacity， mechanical digestion， and gastric emptying . Proper nutritional status plays a key role in the care of cancer patients and in postoperative recovery， so nutri-tion intervention to optimize nutrition status should be prior-itized at the time of diagnosis and conducted in parallel with anti-cancer treatment.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 52-year-old man was admitted to the Department of General and Minimally Invasive Surgery， University Hospital in Bydgoszcz on March 14， 2022. The purpose of admitting the patient to the hospital was to facilitate evaluation of chronic abdominal pain and malnutrition reported by the patient. He had been on parenteral nutrition for 2.5 years. In the history of the disease6 years earlier (11/04/2016) a neoplastic process in the stom-ach was suspected in an endoscopic examination and the di-agnosis was confirmed in a histopathological examination as carcinoma mucocellulare G3. In May 2016， a total gastrecto-my with an “omega\" type esophageal-intestinal anastomosis with a Brown loop was performed. In June 2016， leakage of the esophageal-intestinal anastomosis and pleural empyema were revealed. In the therapeutic process， a stent was placed at the site of the anastomotic leak.\n\n【10】Healing was achieved and the stent was removed after 1 month. In October 2018， a positron emission tomography (PET) scanusing 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) showed no recurrence of the neoplastic process. One year later (09/2019)， a decision was made to implant a permanent vascular access for paren-teral nutrition. The reason for this decision was severe abdom-inal pain after eating by mouth and progressive weight loss(about 2 kg/month). The control computed tomography exam-ination in November 2019 showed no pathological changes in the gastrointestinal tract and other organs of the abdomi-nal cavity .\n\n【11】The patient denied other diseases. He chronically used bu-prenorphine patches for 2.5 years. He denied smoking ciga-rettes， drinking alcohol， and using other drugs.\n\n【12】Diagnostic and Therapeutic Procedures\n\n【13】On the day of admission to the Department of Surgery， the gen-eral condition of the patient was good (height 180 cm， weight66 kg， BMI： 20.4， 2 points on the NRS 2002 scale \\[Nutritional risk score\\]). He had been on home parenteral nutrition for 2.5years， which provided 1100 calories and 65 g of protein per day. He reported that if he remained without parenteral nu-trition， he lost weight.\n\n【14】Due to increasing abdominal pain after oral intake， a decision was made to perform X-ray examination with the small bowel follow-through while the patient was fasting. The examination showed no features of contrast agent leaking and the esoph-ageal stump was described as having 'smooth wall outline and normal peristalsis’. There was no mechanical obstruction in the small intestine or in the large intestine. The consultingpsychiatrist ruled out psychogenic causes of the symptoms. Angiology and gastroenterology consultation were requested. In the ultrasound examination， the venous and arterial flows in the visceral circulation were normal and the consulting an-giologist excluded a vascular cause of the abdominal pain. In the gastroenterological consultation， a gradual reduction of parenteral nutrition was recommended， while an attempt was made to load the gastrointestinal tract with oral nutrition.\n\n【15】Nutritional treatment was started based on the recommenda-tions of a dietitian. In the nutritional interview， the dietitian determined that the patient ate about 7 meals a day， with a volume of up to 150 g each， and he was in pain after eating these meals. During the analysis of a sample food diary， it was calculated that the patient consumed about 1700 kcal/day orally. He reported symptoms of intolerance to dairy prod-ucts， constipation， and abdominal pain. During the examina-tion， 2 weeks after admission to the hospital， his weight was64 kg and his BMI was 19.75. The calculations established a daily energy requirement of approximately 2400 calories. At the time， he was on a hospital diet that was light， dairy-free， and low-residue. Due to the proposed attempt to abandon parenteral nutrition， abdominal pain after consuming a stan-dard diet， and the need to ensure proper caloric content of the diet， a decision was made to include Modulen IBD (Nestle Health Science) in the patient’s diet， in the amount of 2 por-tions a day with a volume of 6 scoops dissolved in 210 ml of water. This amount provided the patient with 500 kcal and17.5 g of protein. He was instructed to take Modulen IBD in small sips and to drink it between the main meals as a sec-ond breakfast and afternoon snack. In addition， an easily di-gestible， dairy-free， low-residue diet was recommended， and due to constipation reported by the patient， probiotic thera-py was proposed (Vivomix 450 1-2 sachets/day). Modulen IBD was introduced in the absence of specific nutritional recom-mendations to test the patient's tolerance of the preparation before possible treatment modification.\n\n【16】Two days later， another dietary consultation was held， dur-ing which the patient was found to have very good tolerance of Modulen IBD. In addition， he reported improved rhythm of bowel movements and reduction in abdominal pain after eat-ing. He was offered implementation of the principles of the ModuLife nutritional program， based on the CDED diet (Crohn Disease Exclusion Diet)， and he received brochures about the program and access to the ModuLife mobile application. The nutritional plan was based on food products recommended during phase I of the ModuLife program， with a daily ener-gy supply of 2000-2100 calories and supplementation with 6scoops of Modulen IBD twice a day， which increased the en-ergy supply by about 500 kcal. The recommended calorie goal was 2400-2500 calories per day. In addition， it was decided to maintain probiotic therapy with Vivomix 450 in the scheme of20 days of taking 1-2 sachets a day of the probiotic， with 10days off， for a total of 3 months.\n\n【17】On March 21， 2022 he was discharged home with a diagno-sis of impaired bowel function resulting from long-term dis-continuation of oral nutrition. Dietary recommendations were maintained， including gradual reduction of parenteral nutrition.\n\n【18】About 3 months later， he was readmitted to the Department of Surgery to assess his nutritional status after implementing the recommendations. A dietary consultation was ordered. During the nutritional interview， he reported continued adherence to the ModuLife program. During the consultation， he was in the124h week of the diet (6h week of phase Il). He expanded the diet in accordance with the program's instructions. He main-tained a consistent body weight of 64 kg. He reported hav-ing a very good mood， no abdominal pain， and regular bow-el movements (once a day， stool with a formed consistency). Laboratory test results， including electrolytes， albumin， creat-inine， glucose， lipid profile， and C-reactive protein， were with-in reference values.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】In the described case， the patient underwent a total gastrectomy due to gastric cancer. Despite effective treatment of the under-lying disease， there were significant adverse effects of surgical treatment in the form of chronic malnutrition， which required years of parenteral nutrition. The need for long-term parenteral nutrition made it impossible for the patient to return to normal life activity. An attempt to extend the oral diet resulted in intensi-fication of abdominal pain， and he also had chronic constipation.\n\n【21】After excluding mechanical， vascular and psychogenic causes of symptoms， it was decided to try to include Modulen IBD in the patient's oral diet. The preparation was well tolerated， so he was offered to implement the principles of the CDED diet(Crohn's Disease Exclusion Diet) - ModuLife Diet. The diet is effective in pediatric patients， and， according to the latest re-search， also in adult patients with Crohn's disease in inducing remission of the disease . In a typical nutritional regimen， which was also used in this case， the CDED diet supplemented with Modulen (providing 50% of caloric intake) is maintained for 6 weeks， followed by the recommendations of the CDED diet supplemented with Modulen， providing 25% of caloric needs. Modulen is a nutritionally complete diet， normocaloric and normoprotein， rich in medium-chain fatty acids， and con-taining the transforming growth factor TGF-B2. TGF-B2 plays a role in the processes of cell differentiation and proliferation， wound healing， as well as the functioning of the immune sys-tem. Its effect， even on the same cell lines， is varied and may vary depending on the clinical situation \n\n【22】The goal of the CDED diet is to limit exposure to nutrients that have an adverse effect on the intestinal microbiota and per-meability and functioning of the intestinal barrier. Another argument in favor of using the CDED diet in Crohn's disease， but also in the case of impaired bowel function， as in the de scribed case， is the avoidance of pro-inflammatory factors of the diet， such as food additives . Recommended foods include chicken breast meat， eggs， potatoes， various fruits， and vegetables. Some products are prohibited， includ-ing processed foods， animal fat， gluten， and dairy， and the list of prohibited foods is shortened in the next phase of the nu-tritional program. The effectiveness of such management in children with Crohn's disease was confirmed by Levin et al， including a prospective randomized study . In children receiving CDED in combination with partial enteral nutrition， the acceptance of the nutritional program was definitely bet-ter than only enteral nutrition with an industrial preparation administered orally or， in the case of poor tolerance， through a gastric tube . Achieving clinical remission was associat-ed with a reduction in inflammation expressed by a decrease in the concentration of CRP in the blood serum and calprotec-tin in the feces. Beneficial changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota were also observed， namely an increase in the amount of Firmicutes and a decrease in Proteobacteria in the feces . The results of some clinical trials indicate improvement in the nutritional status of patients after use of the CDED diet by supplementing the deficiencies of nutrients， trace elements， and vitamins involved in the mechanism of tis-sue repair and immune defense . The authors of stud-ies in which CDED was used in combination with partial en-teral nutrition with Modulen in patients with Crohn's disease discussed its anti-inflammatory effect and improvement ofnutritional status due to continuous contact of the prepara-tion with the pathologically changed mucosa of the gastroin-testinal tract. Such dietary management improves diet toler-ance with the use of the gastrointestinal tract and allows for a gradual increase in meal portions .\n\n【23】Conclusions\n\n【24】In the described case， the patient did not have inflammato-ry bowel disease， but presented with symptoms of impaired bowel function resulting from long-term cessation of oral nu-trition. We hypothesize that the nutritional and immunomod-ulating effect of Modulen， in combination with an anti-inflam-matory elimination diet， results in better nutrition of intestinal epithelial cells and a gradual improvement in intestinal motil-ity and absorption， which in turn enabled the patient to com-pletely discontinue parenteral nutrition and return to normal life activity. It seems， therefore， that this type of nutritional management may also be considered in other cases of im-paired bowel function.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Because no single clinical， biochemical， or radiological sign or investigation can be relied on to diagnose Ewing sarcoma， practitioners should send such cases to an Ewing sarcoma multidisciplinary team even there is just a little suspicion of malignancies.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Magnetic Resonance Imaging， Ewing Sarcoma， Osteomyelitis， Radiograph Study\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Ewing sarcoma is a highly aggressive bone and soft tissue tu-mour (primarily bone) with a peak incidence in children and young adults (<30 years)， with Asian and black populations be-ing particularly rare. In the Western world， the annual incidence of Ewing sarcoma has been reported around 2.93/1，000，000 cases. Survival rates for patients with a localized disease with mul-timodal therapy are approaching 70%. Patients with metastatic， refractory， or relapsed disease， on the other hand， have a poor prognosis (5-year overall survival is about 42%).\n\n【4】Clinically， Ewing sarcoma in the bone can look like os-teomyelitis (both can cause fever， increased serum inflamma-tory markers， and bone pain) and on imaging tests (both may present with aggressive periosteal reaction， cortical destruc-tion， and articular involvement). Indeed， it has been reported that up to 50% of subacute osteomyelitis cases in children are misdiagnosed as tumours. However， quickly and accu-rately distinguishing between these two entities is critical be-cause treatment and outcome are completely different . Thedifferential diagnosis for osseous lesions in individuals with pain and/or swelling includes benign and malignant tumours， pseudo-tumours (eosinophilic granuloma)， and osteomyelitis. Acute， subacute， and chronic osteomyelitis relate to infections lasting weeks， one to three months， or more than three months， respectively. In addition， purulent collections in the bone might develop into abscesses over time. In individuals with a soft-tissue mass， differential diagnoses include benign and malignant tumours， fluid collections (hematoma， abscess)， and granuloma-tous infections .\n\n【5】The narrowing of the differential diagnosis is complicated by two additional factors. For starters， age does not effectively restrict the differential diagnosis because primary bone tumours and osteomyelitis are more common in children and adolescents. Second， in rare circumstances， infection and tumour may coexist. As a result， a pain and swelling presentation's underlying diag-nosis may be confusing. According to one study， 50 percent of all incidences of pediatric subacute osteomyelitis are misdiagnosed as tumours at first. Blood tests for the acute phase response，as well as imaging tests like radiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)， and， lastly， a biopsy with culture and histological examination are all common.\n\n【6】Imaging of ewing sarcoma\n\n【7】Conventional radiology (CR)， which facilitates examination of the biological behaviour of isolated bone lesions， is the foun-dation of the initial approach to disorders of the bones and joints. It generally shows the lesion's location， internal matrix， borders， and accompanying periosteal reaction in great detail. When these lesion characteristics are paired with the patient’s age， differential diagnoses of bone lesions are usually made . Identifying and describing periosteal reactions is an important aspect of determining the behaviour and aggressiveness of such lesions. The classification of periosteal reactions is frequently divided into classical subtypes， and each of these categories might lead to the diagnosis of a disease or a specific type of malignancy. For example， the solid subtype of periosteal re-action strongly implies nonaggressive， slow-growing lesions， whereas the laminated (\"onion skin\") subtype strongly suggests processes with intermediate aggressiveness. On the other hand， interrupted， spiculated， or complex periosteal reactions can sug-gest aggressive or fast-growing bone lesions， which have a bad prognosis . Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)， which has a strong negative predictive value for malignant bone tumours， is now used as the primary diagnostic work-up for bone pain， particularly in children. However， if the MRI results are incon-clusive， projection radiography or， in the case of overlapping regions， computed tomography (CT) must be used. On projec-tion radiography/CT， permeative osteolysis (stage ⅢI， according to Lodwick-Madewell classification)， periosteal reactions with interrupted compacta (onion skin phenomenon， spiculae， Cod-man triangle)， and matrix mineralization are all signs that point to a suspected malignant bone tumour such as Ewing sarcoma. In addition， solid displacement of bone marrow， extraosseous tumour expansion， and joint infiltration are all indicators of malignancy on MRI.\n\n【8】The MRI provides more information about differential di-agnoses. Choosing the correct sequences is critical： while the classic T1 and T2 contrast are required， proton-weighted and gradient-echo sequences are ineffective for tissue characteriza-tion. Ewing sarcoma appears as a solid tumour mass in bone on MRI， with a low signal intensity in T1 and a high signal intensityin T2. There is frequently a sharp transition zone in the bone portion of the tumour. Peritumoral oedema and gadolinium enhancement are seen in the tumour. There is frequently a soft-tissue mass present. In contrast to osteomyelitis， MRI does not reveal specific signs that can include or exclude Ewing sarcoma.\n\n【9】MRI is highly sensitive for detecting bone abnormalities be-cause it can characterize bone marrow involvement， soft tissue invasion， and fluid content of lesions . In addition， MRI hasutility in detecting periosteal reactions. However， there was no significant difference in the utility of CR and MRI in detecting periosteal reactions. Our findings indicate that the two meth-ods for detecting periosteal reactions have a high interobserver agreement. The interobserver agreement between CR andMRI for identifying aggressive periosteal reactions by subtype was variable， with a better agreement for the Codman's triangle sub-type and worse agreement for the laminated and spiculated subtypes. MRI had a high specificity and a low sensitivity for di-agnosing periosteal reaction compared to CR . The native T1sequence-\"trust in T1\"-is best suited for determining resection height. Different sequences， such as T2 TSE and T1 TSE with contrast media and fat saturation， must be added to the protocol to address extraosseous tumour infiltration of adjacent vascu-lar/nervous bundles or joint compartments. These findings will influence the extent and technique of local therapy .\n\n【10】The presence of a soft-tissue mass is the most significant MRI marker for separating Ewing sarcoma from osteomyelitis， according to Kasalak， Mer， et al.， with diagnostic accuracies of around 80%. This feature can be used to tell the difference between Ewing sarcoma and other cancers and osteomyelitis and other benign diseases. The transition zone of the bone lesion was only good predictive， with diagnostic accuracies of around60%. The penumbra sign， intramedullary and extramedullary fat globules， and diagnostic accuracy were all 50% . In a small dataset， radiologists were 100 percent sensitive but only55 percent specific and 73 percent accurate in identifying bone cancer using plain radiographs and MRI. Considering the limits of advanced imaging and the rarity of bone malignancies in clinical practice .\n\n【11】Ewing sarcoma has a heterogeneous appearance on MRI. It can be difficult to clinically diagnose in its earliest stages prior to the significant cortical destruction following spread beyond the bone marrow .\n\n【12】Biopsy in ewing sarcoma\n\n【13】The biopsy method of choice in Ewing sarcoma remains debat-able. An open or core needle biopsy (CNB) is advised if Ewing sarcoma is suspected. Furthermore， if possible， suspected soli-tary bone metastases and lymph node metastases should be biopsied at the time of presentation. According to some pub-lished studies， the accuracy of open biopsies is close to 100%. CNB-reported biopsy success rates range from 50% to 98 per-cent in sarcoma patients. The success rate of needle biopsy may be lower than that of open biopsy particularly in Ewing sarcoma patients. However， inexperienced centres， sampling errors may be as low as in open biopsies. Importantly， Ewing sarcoma can clinically and radiologically mimic osteomyelitis(fever， increased infection values， isolated bone pain). There-fore， the possibility of a biopsy material sampling error with merely reactively altered tissue must always be considered， and if in doubt， new sampling should be considered. Regardless of the biopsy method used， it is critical to avoid hematomas and contamination of neurovascular structures or joints because all contaminated tissue must be resected if Ewing sarcoma is diagnosed .\n\n【14】Therapy of ewing sarcoma\n\n【15】Patients with Ewing sarcoma require highly personalized local therapy. Therefore， patients and families should be allowed to investigate local treatment alternatives as soon as possible afterbeing diagnosed， and local therapy decisions should be made in consultation with them. Expert interdisciplinary tumour boards are required to establish the optimal course of action in each case. The optimum technique for local control in Ewing sarcoma patients is governed by some parameters， including the patient’s age， tumour site， size， and local extension .\n\n【16】Unless emergency surgery is required at the time of diagno-sis， such as spinal cord compression， definitive surgery normally follows neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients should be referred to a reliable hospital for their procedure， which is critical. The duration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is the primary determi-nant of the timing of local surgical therapy. It is also influenced by the availability of the required technical devices (e.g.， custom-made implants， scheduling an irradiation appointment) as well as the most experienced interdisciplinary surgical and /or radia-tion therapist team. It may look desirable to maintain high-dose intensity by scheduling 1-2 extra cycles of chemotherapy before adequate local treatment to obtain the optimal logistical and technical execution .\n\n【17】Reconstructive surgical procedures should be performed wherever possible， although oncological control should take precedence over limb preservation. Bone reconstruction surgery is required in most patients undergoing local surgical therapy. Biological reconstruction with bone grafts is one option， which is particularly beneficial in intercalary bone lesions where the original joint must be preserved. Allografts， vascularized fibula grafts， and irradiated autografts are all common procedures. These excel at various advantages and disadvantages in terms of complexity or reconstructive survival .\n\n【18】Primary amputation is rarely required in Ewing sarcoma due to tumour reduction after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the availability of definitive RT as a viable option to surgery. How-ever， patients with severe postoperative complications and tu-mours in which limb salvage would jeopardize the required sur-gical margin， such as extended infiltration of the neuro/vascular bundle， cases of tumour progression during neoadjuvant treat-ment， or very young patients under the age of 3-6 years with lower extremity tumours， should have ablative surgery per-formed. Local recurrence or periprosthetic infection are the most common reasons for subsequent amputation. In comparing the quality of life of patients who underwent amputation or limb-salvage surgery， no long-term outcomes were discovered. Rotationplasty is a type of lower-leg amputation that allows patients to preserve a functional hip and a modified knee joint. This procedure is most suited for children under six .\n\n【19】Sarcoma or infection process\n\n【20】Sarcomas are rare malignant tumours of the mesenchymal type that make up less than 1% of all malignant neoplasms. The most common signs of bone and soft tissue sarcomas are pain and swelling. These are， however， the hallmarks of inflammatory， benign neoplastic， and infectious illnesses， making clinical diag-nosis challenging. As a result， numerous clinical specializations are required for prompt and correct diagnosis .\n\n【21】A study of bone and soft tissue infections that mirror sarcoma infections was published by J. R. LEX et al. When patients were referred for a probable bone sarcoma， the rate of osteomyelitis was rather high， at 2.1 percent， compared to 0.7 percent for soft-tissue infections that were initially assumed to be soft-tissue sarcomas. In addition， patients with osteomyelitis are 18 years old on average， compared to 46 years for patients with soft-tissue infections .\n\n【22】The pain was the most common symptom in patients with os-teomyelitis， whereas swelling was the most common symptom in soft tissue infections. On the other hand， soft-tissue infec-tions were frequently associated with discomfort (70 percent)， but soft-tissue sarcomas are typically painless masses. The sys-temic disturbance occurred in just 9.0 percent and 7.4 percent of individuals with bone and soft-tissue infections， respectively. These signs and symptoms are very common in sarcoma. As a result， based on clinical presentation and anatomical location， it is impossible to distinguish sarcoma from infection .\n\n【23】Inflammatory markers were more likely to be increased in the soft-tissue group. Radiological tests could not distinguish between tumour and infection in 59.7% of osteomyelitis patients and 81.5% of soft-tissue infection cases. No organism was de-tected in 64.9 percent of patients who received a percutaneous biopsy culture .\n\n【24】Osteomyelitis\n\n【25】A bone infection causes osteomyelitis， with bacteria being the most prevalent causative agent (Staphylococcus aureus). In chil-dren， hematogenous osteomyelitis is the most common cause， with trauma， surgery， or infected adjacent soft tissue being less common . Acute osteomyelitis affects roughly eight children per 100，000 each year. In nearly half of the instances， children under five are afflicted， with a male/female ratio of 2：1. Acute os-teomyelitis is nearly twice as prevalent as septic arthritis， and its incidence is on the rise (due in part to the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance among Staphylococci).\n\n【26】Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sen-sitive imaging modality for identifying osteomyelitis， imaging characteristics can be deceiving， frequently mimicking severe infiltrative malignancies. In addition， the overlapping clinical characteristics of osteomyelitis and skeletal tumours， such as lo-calized pain， fever， and high inflammatory markers， complicate the diagnosis. In the past， osteomyelitis has been reported as a skeletal neoplasm that mimics Ewing sarcoma，chondrosarcoma， and other skeletal neoplasms. Radiographic misinterpretation of osteomyelitis is widespread in children， with 50% of all in-stances of subacute osteomyelitis being misdiagnosed as ma-lignancies. Extraosseous marrow fat in the location of marrow signal abnormalities is a specific observation in acute and aggres-sive osteomyelitis that may help in imaging-based separation of these entities. Acute suppurative reaction to medullary bacterial proliferation can cause an increase in intramedullary pressure， rupturing the cortex and causing medullary fat to be expelled into the surrounding soft tissues .\n\n【27】CRMO is a rare idiopathic inflammatory condition character-ized by recurring episodes of non-infectious osteomyelitis. The slow onset of nonspecific pain， swelling， and discomfort over an afflicted joint characterize CRMO. CRMO is characterized by musculoskeletal pain that alternates between exacerbation and improvement. The average age at which symptoms first appear is between 8 and 14 . Radiographs are the most common type of first imaging， and they can be normal or show abnor-malities near the metaphysis and growth plates. Lesions can be entirely osteolytic， mixed lytic and sclerotic， or solely sclerotic， depending on the chronicity. The lesions have a symmetrical appearance， involving the metaphyses and epiphyses of long bones. Clinical and temporal symmetry are typically absent in lesions. The femur and tibia are the long bones that are most typically impacted. The spine， pelvis， mandible， hands， and feet are potential involvement locations. CRMO is distinguishedfrom other procedures because it involves the clavicle . The presence of osseous involvement on imaging that is not clinically evident distinguishes CRMO. As a result， whole-body imaging， such as Tc-99 bone scintigraphy or MRI， is routinely done to aid in finding asymptomatic lesions and establishing a baseline of disease burden. Increased uptake is visible in radionuclide in-vestigations， with early uptake indicating inflammation and late uptake indicating bone sclerosis. Bone scans are not conducted as often as they used to be because of absorption in the growth plates and patient radiation exposure. Because it does not expose the patient to radiation and provides more accurate anatomy and soft tissue assessment， whole-body MRI has become the rec-ommended investigation. An MRI can reveal marrow oedema， periostitis， soft tissue inflammation， transphyseal illness， and joint involvement. Acute signs on MRI are hyperintense and increased with contrast on fluid-sensitive sequences.\n\n【28】On the other hand， chronic lesions are hypointense on both T1 and T2 due to lesion sclerosis. The limited examination of the ribs and skull due to the considerable slice thickness is one of the potential limitations of MRI. Increased costs and the require-ment for general anaesthesia， usually required in children ， are further drawbacks. The clinical course and radiological and histopathological picture of ES and osteomyelitis are so similar that objectively distinguishing these two diseases is difficult. A biopsy may provide a more accurate diagnosis， but it has limitations. The diagnostic utility of FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared) spectroscopy helps distinguish between these two clin-ically significant diseases. The chemical composition of normal， osteomyelitis， and ES bone tissue was determined using FTIR spectroscopy. The greatest differences in the osteomyelitis group were related to maximum absorbance values in the FTIR regio：n1，which corresponded to lipid functional groups. The altered lipid content could be due to increased lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) concentration. This enzyme is a marker of oxidative stress be-cause it is responsible for the oxidative degradation of lipids to reactive aldehydes like malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal.\n\n【29】Conclusion\n\n【30】This study emphasized distinguishing Ewing sarcoma and bone and soft-tissue infection difficulties. A thorough investigation is recommended given the similarities in age， anatomical location， and clinical features of infections and tumours. Because no sin-gle clinical， biochemical， or radiological feature or investigation can be relied on for diagnosis， clinicians should refer such cases to an Ewing sarcoma multidisciplinary team if there is a little suspicion of malignancies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

On the most recent hospital admission， abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed an internal hernia of the gastroduodenal junction through the tissues used as a fundoplication wrap of the abdominal esophagus. The imaging findings were confirmed at exploratory laparoscopy， at which time surgical takedown of the fundoplication was performed.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】This report is of a rare case of gastroduodenal hernia through a fundoplication wrap two years after a Nissen fundoplication. However， clinicians should be aware of this rare diagnosis in patients with a history of Nissen fundoplication who present with acute upper gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\n【6】MeSH Keywords： Fundoplication· Hernia · Laparoscopy\n\n【7】Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is common in Western countries， and there has been an increase in prevalence since1995， particularly in North America and East Asia . The prev alence of GERD has been estimated to be between 18.1-27.8%in North America，8.8-25.9% in Europe， 2.5-7.8% in East Asia，8.7-33.1% in the Middle East， 11.6% in Australia， and 23.0%in South America . The symptoms of GERD can be well con-trolled medically in most patients with the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Despite their widespread use， PPIs are asso-ciated with complications that include gastrointestinal infec-tion， hypocalcemia， hypomagnesemia， osteoporosis， and an increased risk of bone fracture . However， some patients are refractory or resistant to medical treatment and require surgical management . The most common indications for surgical treatment of GERD include lack of response to medi-cal treatment， erosive GERD， Barrett esophagus， hiatus her-nia， and severe symptoms of GERD， particularly at night time. Before surgical treatment， three tests are required that in-clude gastroscopy， 24-hourly ambulatory pH measurement with multichannel intraluminal impedance monitoring， and esophageal manometry.\n\n【8】Laparoscopic surgery for GERD is now the gold-standard treat-ment for patients with symptoms that are refractory to PPIs， with the most common procedure being laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication， which involves the use of the upper part of the gastric fundus as a fundoplication wrap for the abdominal esophagus . The efficacy and the longterm effects of laparo-scopic Nissen fundoplication were initially described in 1994 by Cadiere et al. Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is a safe and effective procedure， but as in other surgical procedures， complications may occur， which include bleeding， gastric fistula formation， migration of the fundoplication wrap， tissue isch-emia， postoperative dysphagia， and residual symptoms of re-gurgitation . However， in 2013， a cost-effectiveness study showed that laparoscopic surgery was more cost-effective than medical management for GERD . This report is of a rare case of internal gastroduodenal hernia through the fundoplication wrap as a late complication of laparoscopic Nissen fundopli-cation for the management of GERD in a 19-year-old woman.\n\n【9】Case Report\n\n【10】A 19-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency depart-ment with a three-day history of epigastric pain， anorexia， and altered bowel habit. Two years previously， the patient had undergone a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication at a dif-ferent institution for the treatment of gastroesophageal re-flux disease (GERD).\n\n【11】On hospital admission， physical examination revealed that the patient was hemodynamically stable. She had generalized abdominal pain and tenderness on palpation and rebound in the epigastric and left hypochondrial regions with absent bowel sounds. Laboratory tests revealed an increase in se rum C-reactive protein (CRP)1 (35.6 mg/L) without leukocyto-sis. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed that fol-lowing Nissen fundoplication two years previously there was an internal hernia of the gastroduodenal junction through the gastric fundus used to wrap the abdominal esophagus， with no other abnormalities .\n\n【12】The patient underwent an exploratory laparoscopy that con-firmed the CT findings . An internal hernia of the gas-troduodenal junction through the gastric fundus used to wrap the abdominal esophagus was identified with complete her-niation of the stomach， but no attachment was found to the esophagus， and no intrathoracic hernia was found. The tissues forming the fundoplication wrap were poorly vascularized， and a decision was made to resect the tissue using an endoscopic linear cutter. A drain was sited， and surgical takedown of the fundoplication was performed. Because no clinical notes were available to identify the nature of the surgical procedure per-formed two years previously， the findings at exploratory lapa-roscopy identified that a Nissen fundoplication had been pre-viously performed. Also， at exploratory laparoscopy， the tissue used as a fundoplication wrap was found to have no esopha-geal attachment.\n\n【13】The postoperative clinical course for this patient was un-eventful. The nasogastric tube was removed， and the patient was able to drink on the first postoperative day. On the sec-ond postoperative day， she began to eat a soft diet. On the third postoperative day， the patient underwent a water-sol-uble esophagogram that confirmed the restoration of the esophagogastroduodenal outlet . The patient was discharged from the hospital on the fourth postoperative day. At a three-month follow-up， the patient was in good health， and her symptoms of GERD were well controlled with the use of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux dis-ease (GERD)， and the most common complications of this sur-gical procedure are now well known . A feature of laparo-scopic Nissen fundoplication is the use of the upper part of the gastric fundus as a fundoplication wrap for the abdomi-nal esophagus . This report presented a rare case of internal gastroduodenal hernia two years after laparoscopic Nissen fun-doplication， which occurred through the fundoplication wrap.\n\n【16】In the English literature， there have been few previously re-ported cases of this rare complication of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication .\n\n【17】During laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication， the attachment of the fundoplication wrap to the lower esophagus and the use of posterior gastropexy are used to prevent complications that include para-esophageal herniation and migration of the19-year-old woman who developed an internal gastroduodenal hernia two years after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The images taken during exploratory laparoscopy show the appearance of the stomach (A) and the Nissen fundoplication wrap (C). Progressive laparoscopic reduction of the internal hernia through the fundoplication wrap (B).\nfundoplication wrap . However， in this case， no esopha-geal attachment was found， which might explain the migra-tion of the fundoplication wrap and the development of an in-ternal gastroduodenal hernia.\n\n【18】In cases of internal gastroduodenal hernia， the lack of specific symptoms can result in a delay in diagnosis. Late diagnosis can result in gastric perforation and peritonitis， or respiratory com-promise. Early abdominal computed tomography (CT) should be performed to identify cases of internal gastroduodenal hernia. However， both radiologists and surgeons should be aware of this rare complication of fundoplication procedures. In this case， exploratory laparoscopy confirmed the imaging findings and allowed surgical takedown of the fundoplication. This surgical approach was chosen， rather than anti-reflux surgery， because the patient was at high risk of ischemia of the stomach due to occlusion of the arteries in the fundoplication wrap. Also， further surgery may have extended the duration of the para-lytic ileus and resulted in bowel perforation. The alternative surgical procedure for GERD， laparoscopic Toupet fundoplica-tion， was not routinely used at our center. Therefore， to control the patient's symptoms of GERD， she was medically treated postoperatively with a proton pump inhibitor (PPl). This case also highlights the importance of accessing accurate details of previous surgical procedures performed on all patients who present to the emergency department with acute symptoms.\n\n【19】Conclusions\n\n【20】A rare case is presented of a 19-year-old woman who developed an internal gastroduodenal hernia two years after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication for the management of gastroesopha-geal reflux disease (GERD).

Patients with antibodies against adrenal and thyroid cells， thymoglobulin， gastric parietal cells， and pancreatic islet cells have been found to have antibodies against melanocytes.By electron microscopy， some of the melanocytes were shown to have undergone degenerative changes . However， vitil-igo has been reported with autoimmune conditions， includ-ing insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM)， alopecia areata， hypothyroidism， Graves' disease， Addison’s disease， pernicious anemia， melanoma， and uveitis， notably Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome .\n\n【10】Choroidal vitiligo is an acquired condition manifesting flat depigmentation of the normally pigmented choroid. This condition can occur as a primary or secondary process. Primary choroidal vitiligo develops as an idiopathic pro-cess with no previous inflammation， toxicity， or trauma.

We decided to seek assistance from ancillary tests such as OCT， fluorescein angiography (FA)， ultrasonogra-phy， ERG and visual field test.\n\n【15】FA showed choroidal hyperfluorescence and transmission of sclera autofluorescence at the site of choroidal hypopig-mentation in both eyes .\n\n【16】In addition， FA revealed a slight choroidal hyperfluorescence in the region of depigmentation compared with the normal pigmented choroid， without any dye leakage .\n\n【17】OCT  demonstrated normal retinal anato-my and RPE without significant visible choroidal patholo-gy .\n\n【18】Humphrey visual field， ERG， and ocular ultrasonography were normal. The fundus and iris vitiligo remained un-changed during the l-year follow-up.\n\n【19】DISCUSSION\n\n【20】Primary choroidal vitiligo is a rare condition， with only a few reported cases in the literature. Ciardella et al described a 43-year-old Hispanic woman with diabetes mellitus， cuta-neous vitiligo， and bilateral asymptomatic choroidal vitili-go with no signs of inflammation or RPE alterations .\n\n【21】Vingerling et al observed 2 Chinese patients， a 59-year-old man and a 48-year-old woman， with extensive choroidal vit-iligo and cutaneous vitiligo .\n\n【22】Recently， Sheilds et al reported 4 cases of choroidal vitiligo associated with cutaneous vitiligo ：\n\n【23】1\\. A 57-year-old asymptomatic Caucasian woman with hypo-thyroidism and fibromyalgia and an 18-year history of cu-taneous vitiligo；\n\n【24】2.A 59-year-old asymptomatic African American woman with diabetes mellitus and cutaneous vitiligo；.\n\n【25】3\\. A 73-vear-old asymptomatic Hispanic woman with diabe-tes mellitus and faint cutaneous vitiligo；\n\n【26】4\\. A 65-year-old asymptomatic African American woman with a 25-year history of diabetes mellitus and a 4-year history of cutaneous vitiligo.\n\n【27】In all of the reported cases， there was no past or present oc-ular inflammation， the overlying RPE was found intact， and the visual fields were nermal.\n\n【28】This present case is a 12-year-old girl with insulin-depen-dent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and with bilateral asymp-tomatic choroidal vitiligo and no signs of inflammation or RPE alterations. She also had unilateral sectorial iris vitili-go in her right eye， while her skin was not involved. This is the first such published case in the literature.\n\n【29】Some researchers showed that neonatal animals such as mice， suffering from vitiligo， had no uveal pigment. Pigment ap-peared in the iris and ciliary body by day 4 and in the choroid by week 3. On day 4， along with pigmentation， conspicuous spherical amelanotic cells appeared over the anterior border of the iris. They also occurred in the stroma of the iris and the ciliary body， associated with necrotic melanocytes. The spherical cells were identical to the clump cells of Koganei and were way countless in vitiligo mice. Macroscopically， no progressive decrease in iridial pigment was apparent for the life of the vitiligo mouse. In the choroid， an amelanotic patch surrounded the optic nerve. In the pigmented areas， melanocytes showed compartmentalization of melanosomesand degeneration. The retinal pigment epithelium gener-ally appeared continuous .\n\n【30】Some dermatologists have examined patients with cutane-ous vitiligo for ocular abnormalities and reported pigment clumps， focal hypopigmented spots， and choroidal nevi； their findings however， were similar to those patients hav-ing no vitiligo symptoms. The ocular findings included iris involvement， peripapillary atrophy， RPE atrophy， and focal and diffuse hypopigmentation of the retina .\n\n【31】The reports of Sheilds， Ciardella， Vingerling differ greatly from this present case report， in which the patient had cuta-neous vitiligo， which was subtle， in some instances accompa-nied with a slight depigmentation in the skin .However， the absence of any cutaneous vitiligo or skin discolorationin this patient is quite interesting. This is probably due to the young age of this patient in contrast with all those pre-vious reported cases， which were over 40 years old. All of the patients acquired skin vitiligo in a period of their life. Despite the absence of the skin vitiligo in this case， the typ-ical fundus feature， angiographic findings， and iris vitiligo， accompanied with the presence of an autoimmune disease such as IDDM， the diagnosis of choroidal vitiligo is strong-ly supported. According to the studies conducted on ani-mals， the coat of vitiligo mice is progressively lightened as the mice grow older， and the likelihood of future receptive-ness of this present case to cutaneous vitiligo is strong . Although the patients were referred with the diagnosis of suspicious choroidal nevus， both in the present case and those previously reported， it was ruled out with FA and ex-act clinical examination.\n\n【32】In addition， Sheilds et al reported the OCT and autofluo-rescence features of choroidal vitiligo for the first time . All of the cases also had an intact overlying retina without photoreceptor degeneration in OCT， with the preservation of visual acuity when there was extensive vitiligo at the fun-dus. By autofluorescence， the patches of vitiligo closely cor-related with bright transmission of underlying sclera hyper autofluorescence. There was no sign of RPE abnormality on autofluorescence. Fluorescein angiography revealed a slight choroidal hyperfluorescence in the region of vitiligo compared with the normal pigmented choroid； however， no leakage or staining was seen .\n\n【33】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【34】In conclusion， we present a young diabetic patient with bi-lateral asymptomatic choroidal vitiligo signs accompanied with unilateral sectorial iris vitiligo， with no cutaneous vitili-go； we subsequently coined the term“Irido-Choroidal Vitiligo”.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Primary tumors such as myxomas and metastasis from breast cancer， lung cancer， or melanomas account for many of the re-maining cases. Burkitt lymphoma manifesting as an intracardiac mass is a rare entity， with 21 cases reported in the English literature.\n\n【2】Case Report： We report the case of a man infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who presented with non-spe-cific cardiac symptoms and was later found to have intracardiac mass caused by Burkitt lymphoma. His rapid decline with unexpected complications was reversed with prompt management. Subsequent to induction， the patient achieved a near complete response with considerable improvement in his conditionConclusions： Lymphoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis ofintracardiac masses. Associated cardiac symp-toms are frequently non-specific and can often be overlooked or underappreciated. Burkitt lymphoma has a short doubling time and an intracardiac lesion can become life-threatening in a matter of days. Early recogni-tion and prompt treatment are crucial to achieving optimal outcomes.\n\n【3】MeSH Keywords： Burkitt Lymphoma· Heart Neoplasms · Lymphoma， Non-Hodgkin\n\n【4】Burkitt lymphoma (BL) constitutes less than 1% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) ， and this percentage increases to 25% to 30% in patients with human immunodeficiency vi-rus (HIV) infection . The incidence of cardiac involvement with NHL ranges from 9% to 24% in autopsy series . This has increased steadily over time  due to increased life ex-pectancy of immunocompromised individuals and improve-ment in diagnostic tests . Diffuse large B cell lymphoma is the most common lymphoma involving the heart. BL man-ifesting as an intracardiac mass is extremely rare， with only21 reported cases in the English literature. We report a case in an HlV-infected patient followed by a review of the pub-lished literature.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】A 27-year-old white man presented with palpitations and diz-ziness of a few days duration. He also complained of 3 months of fatigue and an 18-kg weight loss. He was diagnosed with HIV infection 5 years ago and was compliant with his antiretroviral therapy (combination of elvitegravir， cobicistat， emtricitabine， and tenofovir). The patient denied any history of substance abuse. Pertinent physical findings included irregular pulse with tachycardia，tachypnea， and elevated blood pressure. His oxy-gen saturation was normal (95%) on room air. An ejection sys-tolic murmurwas heard at the left lower sternal border， and his liver was palpable 3 cm below the costal margin. Laboratory work-up revealed a CD4+ T cell count of 79 cells/pL with HIV RNA copies of 90/mL Complete blood count revealed a white blood count of 9100/pL， hemoglobin 12.3 g/dL， and platelet count of 701 000/uL.Occasional premature ventricular com-plexes were noted on his electrocardiogram.\n\n【7】Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pel-vis showed multiple liver lesions， the largest measuring7.8×6.2×10.1 cm . A CT scan of the chest demon-strated a 7-cm lesion within the right atrium  with bilateral pleural effusions. Masses were noted in the medias tinum， lungs， pancreas， kidneys， and ilium. An initial transtho-racic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed a solid (5x4.3 cm) right atrial mass， invading the base of the right ventricular free wall and the interatrial septum . A small amount of pericardial effusion was also noted. There was no valvular in-volvement and the ejection fraction was preserved. Three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showed that the quantitated volume of the right atrial mass was 29 mL\n\n【8】An ultrasound-guided biopsy of the largest liver lesion revealed a diffuse sheet-like proliferation of intermediate-to-large lym-phoid cells with irregular nuclei . Many areas dem-onstrated a prominent starry sky appearance with scattered macrophages . Scattered mitotic activity was not-ed with areas of apoptosis. On immunoperoxidase stains，the neoplastic cells were strongly and diffusely positive for LCA， CD20， BCL6， and CD10 and had a Ki-67 positivity of 100%. They were negative for CD45RO， BCL1， BCL2， PLAP， AE1/AE3， and Cam 5.2. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed rearrangement of myc and igH t  genes.\n\n【9】A diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) with stage IVB Burkitt lymphoma was made. The insertion of an Ommaya reservoir was planned in anticipation of intrathe-cal chemotherapy. However， the surgery was abandoned when the patient became hypoxic during induction of general anes-thesia. He subsequently developed hypotension and went into cardiogenic shock. A repeat echocardiogram revealed severe tricuspid valve stenosis due to the rapidly growing intra-atri-al tumor， which now extended into the right ventricle. A newright atrial mass consistent with a thrombus was also noted. A diagnosis of cardiac thrombosis overlying the intracardiac tumor was made.\n\n【10】Chemotherapy with modified cyclophosphamide， vincristine， doxorubicin， and methotrexate/ifosfamide， etoposide， cytara-bine (CODOX-M/IVAC regimen) was started. The reason this regimen was chosen instead of a regimen with rituximab is because HIV-positive patients with low CD4 counts often do poorly with rituximab and have increased rates of infection-related deaths. Although recent studies suggest there might be some benefits， these data were not available at the time of this patient's care， and thus it was not incorporated into our management decision. Catheter-directed thrombolytic thera-py with intracardiac infusion of alteplase was given for 5 days. The patient showed a rapid response to therapy with improve-ment in organ function and he was discharged 3 weeks lat-er. He completed 4 cycles of chemotherapy with a completeresolution of his symptoms and cardiac murmur. The intracar-diac mass was notably decreased to 2.0x1.4 cm (previously5×4.3 cm) on TTE  with quantitated volume reduced to 5 mL (previously 29 mL) on TEE. CT scans of the chest and abdomen revealed complete resolution of his pleural effusions and renal masses， with the mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy showing significant response.\n\n【11】Table 1.

HIV patients have a 200-fold increased risk of devel-oping NHL， with 25% to 30% of these being BL or Burkitt-like lymphoma . Unlike other types of HIV-associated lympho-mas， these patients often have CD4 counts greater than 200cells/pL . HIV-associated BL are more likely to have atypi-cal presentations with extra-nodal disease and liver，lung， and other organ involvement .\n\n【18】Intracardiac mass secondary to BL is rare. The usual causes of intracardiac masses are non-neoplastic (e.g.， structural ab-normalities， infections， thrombi，and hamartomas). Neoplastic causes can be metastasis to the heart or primary cardiac tu-mors， with the former being more common . About 90% of all primary cardiac tumors are benign and include myxomas， papillary fibroelastomas， fibromas， lipomas， angiomas， and rhabdomyomas . Sarcomas are the most common malig-nant primary cardiac tumors， accounting for 95% of cases，and mesotheliomas and lymphomas account for the rest . The metastatic intracardiac tumors usually arise from breast or lung cancer， melanoma， or lymphomas .\n\n【19】Primary cardiac lymphomas (PCL) or lymphomas involving only the heart and/or pericardium has an estimated incidence of less than 0.05%. According to the largest published review of PCL， only 197 published cases of PCL were report-ed from 1949 to 2009. Of these， only 13 (6.6%) were BL . Disseminated NHL with cardiac involvement has a higher inci-dence (9% to 24%)  compared to PCL， but there are sug-gestions that these entities might not be as distinct as pre-viously thought. PCL has a propensity to involve the superior vena cava (SVC) and the right side of the heart， which are the areas that receive lymph drainage from the thoracic duct. lt is hypothesized that PCL could be merely a manifestation of occult systemic lymphoma (spreading to the heart by the tho-racic duct) instead of a primarily cardiac issue . Regardless of the origin， an intracardiac mass caused by BL is exceeding-ly rare. To the best of our knowledge， there are only 21 report-ed cases in the English literature . We excluded 4 cas-es that might have met our criteria， because the articles were not available in English. Older cases reported as Burkitt-likeor small non-cleaved cell type on pathology were included un-less otherwise specified.\n\n【20】Among the 22 cases (including present case)， all 3 types of BL were represented (9/22 (41%) sporadic， 4/22 (18%) endem ic， and 9/22 (41%) immunodeficiency-associated). Most were men (17/22 (77%)). The age ranged from 4 to 78 years， with a median of 38 years， much younger than the median age for PCL in adults， which is approximately 60 years . The rea-son for this predilection for intracardiac involvement in young-er patients remains unclear. Common presenting symptoms include dyspnea， palpitation， dizziness， and B-symptoms， which are consistent with prior studies on cardiac lympho-ma . There were 9/22 (41%) HIV-positive cases，7/22(32%) HIV-negative cases， and HIV status was not reported in6/22 (27%). The disease was right-sided in 16/22 (82%) cas-es. Patients received standard chemotherapy regimens such as EPOCH (etoposide， prednisone， vincristine， cyclophospha-mide，and doxorubicin) or CHOP (cyclophosphamide，doxoru-bicin， vincristine， and prednisone) with or without rituximab， Hyper-CVAD (cyclophosphamide， vincristine， doxorubicin， and dexamethasone)， and CODOX-M. A total of 10/22 (45%) pa-tients died. No treatments were reported for 6/10 (60%) pa-tients that died. Most of these patients died within a few days of diagnosis， 9/10 (90%)， and 1 died 6 weeks after diagno-sis. BL was diagnosed at autopsy in 2 cases. The longest sur-viving patient was reported to be alive at 36 months after di-agnosis. It is well known that BL is a highly aggressive tumor， but in the presence of cardiac involvement， it seems to lead to even more complications and worse outcomes.\n\n【21】Symptoms of dyspnea or palpitations are common in BL pa-tients， most of whom do not have any intracardiac involve-ment. BL has a rapid doubling time， and intracardiac involve-ment can become life-threatening very quickly， as seen in our patient. Keeping a high index of suspicion for possible intra cardiac involvement is vital. Pericardial effusion and arrhyth-mias frequently accompany intracardiac lymphomas . TTE is the preferred diagnostic modality . Trans-esophageal echocardiogram (TEE) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are helpful in equivocal cases . Immunosuppression， presence of extra-cardiac disease， left ventricle involvement， and absence of arrhythmia are associated with poor progno-sis . Surgery and radiation therapy have not shown any ben-efit . Early treatment with anthracycline-based chemo-therapy is associated with the best outcome .\n\n【22】Conclusions\n\n【23】BL causing intracardiac mass is rare， with only 21 cases reported in the English literature. The cardiac symptoms are frequently non-specific and can often be overlooked or underappreciatedin the presence of the impressive extra-cardiac disease. Due to the aggressive nature of BL， the cardiac tumor can progress and become life-threatening very quickly. Any delay in diagno-sis or treatment can decrease the chances of survival. Our pa-tient is a good reminder that early detection， treatment， and optimization of cardiac parameters can potentially mean the difference between life and death in these patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "857b4e6b-c276-4884-a933-a1b0e51a31d1", "title": null, "text": "【0】ABSTRACT The risk of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) transmission is increased by crowded indoor settings. Many sites have been identified in the published medical literature as causes of outbreaks but Muslim congregational prayer areas， mosques or masjids， have unusually not been implicated as outbreak sources to date. This article gives a detailed description of this particular setting and a description of the crowd behavior which may account for this finding. Factors identified include open layout， decreased generation of fomite transmission as a result of the physiology of worship， short duration of worship， low sound levels during worship， linear and directional arrangement of worshipers， rules based filling and emptying dynamics， and localisation of crowds.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Prayer， COVID19，transmission\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) is caused by positive sense ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus， severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has a detailed summary of the current ev-idence regarding transmission. Transmission is mainly through person-to-person contact of respiratory droplets， and direct con-tact of an infected person through hand mediated transfer via the nose， mouth or eyes. There have been many outbreaks in con-fined indoor spaces including factories， churches， restaurants， ski resorts， shopping centres， worker dormitories， cruise ships and vehicles， or events occurring indoors such as parties， and dance classes but no recorded cases of outbreaks from mosques also called masjids.  This naturally raises the question of whether there is a significant difference in the transmission char-acteristics of worshippers in masjids? This article discusses some of the key differences in the behaviour of people attend-ing a masjid which may provide valuable insights into crowd dynamics and raise further avenues of research on transmission dynamics of respiratory viruses such as COVID-19.\n\n【4】Muslim worshippers who attend congregational prayers in a masjid are predominantly male and can attend a variable num-ber of times up to a maximum of five times per day. Attendance is considered by most Muslims to be optional， and this results in relatively low numbers of a given population attending. Most attendees tend to live locally to their masjids. Given this move-ment of these worshippers is on the whole confined to a local area.\n\n【5】The inner space of a masjid is usually a carpeted space where shoes are not permitted and devoid of any furniture. It is effec-tively an open space indoors. Space is marked with lines which run perpendicular to the geographical direction of Makkah. This direction is known as the Qiblah or direction of prayer that all Muslims are required to face when performing their worship. To date， there have been no documented cases of transmission of respiratory viruses from fomites. The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through fomites has been criticised by Professor E Gold-man， Professor of Microbiology at New Jersey Medical School Rutgers University， as being based on studies that have little resemblance to real-life scenarios. Writing in The Lancet Infec-tious Diseases， he concludes that the chance of contamination from an inanimate surface is very small and only occurs in in-stances where a surface has been coughed and sneezed upon and touched by another person within 1-2 hours.  The shortest time between two prayers in masjids lies at 1-2 hours boundary between the sunset and evening prayer. All other prayers havelonger durations between them in the majority of countries of the world.\n\n【6】It is interesting to note that the closest a worshipper is to the floor is during the act of prostration. During this act， worship-pers flex their knees to around 140 degrees and the flexion of the torso over the knees， which is achieved by the flexion at the hip joint of another 140 degrees. This applies pressure to the abdomen， causing exhalation prior to reaching the point of prostration. The worshipper then repeats a given formula of prayer with minimal exhalation which lasts for around 3 to 4seconds. Phonation and loudness of phonation are positively correlated to the production of respiratory droplets. During this act of worship， the degree of phonation is very low， under a whisper and is almost inaudible， and due to the position， there is no inhalation during this act of worship. This is likely to reduce both fomite production and inhalation.\n\n【7】Worshippers are encouraged to form rows which are equidis-tant from each other. The distance between subsequent rows is determined by the space required for an average person to per-form the act of prostration. This distance on average is around120-150 cm and universally followed throughout the Muslim world in masjids. Congregational prayers are led by a single wor-shipper known as the imam who stands the closest to Makkah， and subsequent rows are formed behind the imam. All worship-pers in a row face the same direction during the prayer. No one is permitted to be in front of the imam. This natural interrow distance and uniform direction of facing during prayer are likely to reduce the risk of transmission. Cough etiquette to disrupt the chain of transmission of infectious respiratory diseases have been shown to be not effective.  Cough generated transmis-sion in this scenario where people are arranged in similar rows facing each other’s back has not been studied and is an avenue of further research. It would be reasonable to assume that the transmission dynamics are not the same as two people facing each other， and the transmission of droplets would be curtailed.\n\n【8】The Filling and Emptying Dynamics of a Masjid\n\n【9】The movement of worshippers into and out of a masjid is an ordered process which follows some simple rules. Worshippers are required to complete rows that are closest to the imam， and this results in a constrained filling dynamic when worshippers arrive for prayers. Early arrivals will come to the first row and then wait for prayers to commence. They may wait by sitting or praying in silence. Subsequent rows are filled in a layered fash-ion behind the first row once complete. Once the congregational prayer commences， worshippers are not permitted to move their position from row to row except in exceptional circumstances such as the need to attend to an emergency. Once the prayer is complete worshippers are in a sitting position on the floor with the knees fully flexed and the upper body upright. Emptying begins to occur shortly after this time but is constrained by ac-cess to the exit area. Worshippers are not allowed to cross over people who are seated. Usually， they wait for a clear passageway to open when sufficiently worshippers from the rearmost rows have completed their prayers and left clearing an exit corridor.\n\n【10】Due to social distancing recommendations of maintaining a fixed distance between people in a crowd， worshippers in many masjids have arranged themselves in positions where the con-tiguous rows have been interspaced with gaps. The dominant model in understanding the motion of crowds is known as the attraction-repulsion framework and has three basic rules：  attraction- movement to neighbours in a far zone，  repulsion\n\n【11】\\- movement away from neighbours in a near zone and  align-ment - match the velocity of neighbours in an intermediate zone. The counterintuitive effect of the social distancing rules in the specific context of masjids is that the degree of repulsion and alignment is decreased. By providing gaps in subsequent rows， this has created multiple passages from worshippers in the first rows to pass through other worshippers to reach exits which are usually situated at the rear of a masjid. This ironically is likely to increase the intermingling of people and potential transmission of infection.\n\n【12】Sound Levels in Masjids\n\n【13】Conversation between worshippers pre and post prayers times is frowned upon and if occurs is hushed. During prayer， the conversation is strictly not allowed. Praver is coordinated by audible verbal cues from the imam with the assistance of a micro-phone and loudspeaker system. Worshippers behind the imam are required to follow the imam. Thus movements of prayer ar done in a coordinated fashion. During worship only the imam is permitted to raise his voice， other worshippers are required to listen in silence with the exception of a short and audible vocalisation of a single word “ameen\" in prayers performed loudly. The duration of this ranges from three to five seconds. It is known that phonation increases the production of aerosols and droplets produced from the human respiratory tract， and there is an increased production with louder phonation. It is likely that the relatively quiet environment during prayer times is a reductive factor in the transmission of the respiratory droplet and aerosol formation.\n\n【14】Duration of prayers\n\n【15】Prayer lengths vary by the number of units prayed. A single unit consists of a sequence of actions that start withstanding，bowing， standing， prostrating sitting on fully flexed knees， prostrating and so on. Prayer is ended with the last unit of prayer and in a seated position on fully flexed knees. Elderly or ill worship-pers are permitted to use chairs， but these are used infrequently. Though the units of prayer can vary from two to four， the aver-age duration of prayer remains at 10 minutes. The peak density of worshippers is thus confined to 10 minutes with a rapid re-duction within 5-10 minutes after the end of congregational prayer.\n\n【16】The duration people stay in a confined space is related to the transmission risk. Studies showed that a Washington choir practice lasting 2.5 hours showed that 32 confirmed cases of transmission occurred among 61 participants.  Similarly， a study showed that work in South Korea in call centre situ-ated on the 9th floor showed that most infections occurred with employees sitting on the same side of the floor. The Cen-ters for Disease Control and Prevention， USA have thus set a minimal operational duration for the definition of contact at 15minutes. The duration of peak contact in a masjid is under this duration， and this is likely to be another further protective factor.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】Not all crowds are equal， and the behavioural dynamics of a particular crowd in a given situation are likely to be key deter-minants on the rate of transmission of infection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Epidemiological studies have shown that higher sugar-sweetened beverage consumption is associated with increased risk of developing chronic diseases， including cardiovascular disease， type 2 diabetes mellitus， obesity， non-alcoholic fatty liver disease， gout， and rheumatoid arthritis and to worse symptoms in some patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Anabolic metabolism has been demonstrated to favor the differentiation of proinflammatory T lymphocytes while kat-abolic metabolism to favor regulatory Tlymphocyte differentiation.\n\n【2】Case Report： In a 66-year old male， the onset of gonarthritis and enthesitis and worsening of these symptoms 3 months lat-er were associated with excessive intake of desserts. Two weeks after starting strict avoidance of sugar con-taining nutrients and beverages symptoms disappeared. During the next 6 months， on 3 occasions， the excep-tional consumption of a dessert was followed by a mild and transient recurrence of the symptoms.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】The repeatedly observed recurrence of enthesitis/arthritis symptoms following sugar intake and its disappear-ance following avoidance of sugar， represents an extreme example of a link between metabolism and local in-flammation in the reported individual. The rapid absorption of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose from the intestine， where they derive from hydrolysis of the disaccharide sucrose (sugar) might lead to overactiva-tion of mTOR if not counterbalanced by other mTOR interfering mechanisms.\n\n【5】MeSH Keywords： Arthritis · Autoimmunity·Dietary Sucrose ·T-Lymphocytes， Regulatory\n\n【6】TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases\n\n【7】Living organisms have to adapt to the environment and nu-trients availability. A key role in this adaptation is played by the evolutionary conserved enzyme mechanistic (prior mam-malian) target of rapamycin (mTOR)， a threonine-serine pro-tein kinase . Sabatini provides this description： “mTOR，as the catalytic subunit of 2 distinct protein complexes， mTORC1and mTORC2， is the major regulator of growth in animals and controls most anabolic and catabolic processes in response to nutrients and nutrient-induced signals like insulin\" . Hence mTORC1 regulates metabolism and growth and is regulated by nutrients. I addition， mTOR represents a central node of the cellular signaling network， a master regulator， that senses nu-trients and integrates a plethora of other upstream signals into downstream metabolic programming and reprogramming. It drives the physiological oscillation of anabolic processes， nec-essary for growth， proliferation， production of functional pro-teins and storage of energy fuels， and oscillation of catabolic processes including autophagy， necessary for energy produc-tion during fasting， degradation of damaged cells or its com-ponents， and provision of building blocks for new biosynthesis. Activation of mTOR induces anabolic processes and inhibits catabolic processes including autophagy and vice versa . There are 26 proteins that comprise the nutrient sensing arm of the mTOR pathway that have so far been identified reflect-ing a significant amount of protein space regulating mTOR via nutrients .\n\n【8】Under starvation， the levels of nutrients and growth factors drop， inducing a catabolic state in which energy stores are mobilized to maintain essential functions. Meanwhile， it is known that mTORC1 is inhibited under starving conditions. Mice that have genetically manipulated continuously active Rag GTPases， and as a consequence have continuously active mTOR， once born and separated from the maternal supply of nutrients do not survive periods of fasting because they can-not switch from an anabolic to a catabolic state . In addi-tion to a crucial role for mTOR in physiology， metabolism and the aging process， it is known to be deregulated in common diseases .Mechanistical studies using cell or animal mod-els with either enhanced or inhibited mTOR activation suggest analogous mechanisms may occur in overnutrition or prolonged starvation. Importantly， mTOR hyperactivation from genet-ic or dietary manipulation has been shown to result in insu-lin resistance and impaired glucose homeostasis . Likewise， there are reports linking mTOR dysregulation (hyperactivation) caused by overnutrition and/or genetic mutations to common diseases such as metabolic syndrome， diabetes mellitus， can-cer， and neurologic diseases .\n\n【9】The term mosaic of autoimmunity， coined by Yehuda Shoenfeld， alludes to the many genetic， environmental， and behavioralfactors potentially contributing to autoimmunity and autoim-mune diseases . Distinguishing self and non-self is a complex and dynamic process. Because central immune tolerance due to negative selection in the thymus is incomplete， it has to be complemented by peripheral tolerance exerted through specif-ic suppression by the regulatory T cells (Tregs) . Insufficient Treg cell function is considered a main cause of autoimmu-nity . Following specific T cell receptor stimulation， naive CD4 T cells differentiate into effector T cells： T helper 1 (T 1)， T helper 2 (T 2)， T follicular helper (T)， T helper 17 (T 17)，or T regulatory cells (Treg). T cell differentiation depends on the intensity and duration of the specific T cell receptor stimula-tion， costimulatory signals， cytokines， and as a more recent dis-covery， also on metabolic pathways driven by mTOR . Metabolic signaling has emerged not only as an activation sig-nal， but also as one that can influence and shape differentia-tion. The mTOR signaling pathway has an indispensable role in the process of T cell fate determination， including the dif-ferentiation of naive T cells into either effector or regulatory T cells and the development of CD8 memory T cells. Inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin has been shown to facilitate the induc-tion of anergic and regulatory CD4+ T cells -2 crucial compo-nents of peripheral tolerance - as well as the differentiation of memory CD8+ T cells.Over-activation of mTOR in Treg cells was found to reduce their suppressive activity in a T cell-medi-ated mouse colitis model. Furthermore， in inflammatory condi-tions， over-activation of mTOR promoted Treg instability， loss of FOXP3 expression， and conversion to effector T cells that pro-duced proinflammatory cytokines， (e.g.，IL-17 and IL-1B)lead-ing to the loss of suppressive function . Considering these discoveries， it has been suggested that increased met-abolic pressure (overnutrition) might contribute to breach im-munological self-tolerance  .\n\n【10】Observational data suggest that higher sugar-sweetened bev-erage consumption is linked to a host of chronic diseases， in-cluding cardiovascular disease， type 2 diabetes mellitus， obe-sity， non-alcoholic fatty liver disease， and gout . A study of 2 large prospective cohorts comprising 79 570 and 107 570young and middle-aged women， each with >2 decades of fol-low-up， revealed that regular consumption of sugar-sweetened soda was associated with increased risk of seropositive rheu-matoid arthritis (RA)， independent of other dietary and life-style factors . In a diet survey on 217 people with RA 24%of them reported that foods affect their RA symptoms. Soda with sugar (12.7%) and desserts (12.4%) were most often re-ported to worsen RA symptoms among those who consumed them . Another study of 39 345 middle -aged women who had completed a 131-item validated， semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire， revealed that a high intake of rapid-ly digested and absorbed carbohydrates was significantly and positively associated with plasma highly sensitive C-reactive protein， independent of conventional risk factors for ischemic\n\n【11】Case Report\n\n【12】A healthy 66-year old male， a retired hospital physician and passionate hiker， was affected by an enthesitis of the mesial insertion of the musculus quadriceps and an ipsilateral gonar-thritis in May 2017. Since his retirement approximately1-year before the reported episode， he used to hike up to the top of his“house”mountain (altitude difference over 1000 meters) at least once a week and to ran down afterwards. He had done so also on the day before his complaints began. His height was172 cm， weight 75 kg， calculated body mass index (BMI) was25.4 kg/m2. In the past 30 years he had experienced several episodes of mild enthesitis and/or arthritis at different sites(toe， foot， knee， hip， shoulder， finger). These episodes had dis-appeared spontaneously and without treatment within weeks or months. His family history was remarkable in that his father， one cousin on the father's side， and one nephew had been af-fected by autoimmune thyroiditis. Routine medication consist-ed of valsartan 160 mg daily that the patient had been tak-ing for 15 years. Blood pressure was 130/85 mm Hg. Routine blood examinations including red and white blood cell count， liver and kidney function tests， urinalysis， glycemia， bloodsedimentation rate， C reactive protein (0.15-0.34 mg/dL)， had been repeatedly within the reference range except for an ele-vation of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) (133-186mg/dL \\[reference <115 mg/dL\\]). HLA-B27， rheumatoid factor， HlV， and Borrelia burgdorferi antibody tests were negative.\n\n【13】The patient reported a burning pain of the knee disturbing his sleep and decreasing with movement. Furthermore， he felt pain at the tendon insertion site occurring especially when walk-ing downwards， while walking upwards or riding a bicycle were not painful. Therefore， he avoided going downwards for the following 2 months， but without improvement. One day the complaints had worsened. Therefore， he thought about events that might have triggered the aggravation the symp-toms. The only extraordinary event the patient recalled was an exceptional consumption of 3 sweet dishes the day before. Moreover， he remembered that in the 2 days prior to the ini-tial onset of the knee symptoms in May he had eaten more than the half of his birthday cake， which he had never done before. Therefore， he decided to avoid dishes and drinks con-taining sugar， and within 2 weeks his complaints disappeared. Out of curiosity， and because he was not convinced of a caus-al relationship between intake of sweets and his joint com-plaints， the patient exceptionally started to have sweet dish-es again. Over the next 6 months this happened 3 times and each time was followed by transient recurrence of the kneecomplaints， although with weakened intensity . Since then， he definitively avoided food and beverages containing sugar. Moreover， he regularly hiked in the mountains without complaints. Avoiding sugar also has led to a 3 kg weight re-duction and to a BMI of 24.3 kg/m².\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Glucose derived from digestion of carbohydrates is vital for any organismal cell. However， the dose of glucose does matter. An increased dose of glucose due to persistent overnutrition or due to the rapid absorption of glucose derived from rapid en-zymatic scission of the disaccharide sucrose (common sugar) into glucose and fructose in the intestine may lead to over-activation of the mTOR signaling pathway. Overactivation of mTOR， if not counterbalanced by inhibitory mechanisms， may have unfavorable consequences for health . We wonder whether in the participants of the mentioned epidemiological studies  and in the described case， the increased intake of sugar， which most likely had been rapidly absorbed， could have led to an over-activation of the mTOR signaling pathway favoring glycolysis， increasing effector T cell cytokine produc-tion and proliferation as well as promoting the differentiation of naive T cells into T 17 cells (actors in inflammation/autoim-munity) at the expense ofTcells (actors in immunotolerance). Might such a shift of the balance between effector T cells and regulatory T cells， towards effector T cells be at the basis of a shift towards a proinflammatory state and/or autoimmunity? Interestingly， in the described case the excessive consumption of sweets was followed by the onset of enthesitis and gonar-thritis and the less excessive consumption of sweets 3 months later was followed by worsening of the symptoms. While in 3occasions even the ingestion of a single sweet， considered as a\"normal dose\"， was followed by symptom recurrence， only strict avoidance of sugar-sweetened food and beverages result-ed in complete resolution of the symptoms . The factthat the enthesitis/gonarthritis symptoms could be repeated-ly triggered by sugar-containing sweets appears to be strong evidence in favor of a causal relationship between the inflam-matory symptoms and sugar intake. We speculate whether the excessive sugar consumption in the first 2 occasions and the consequently rapid glucose uptake in T cells had enhanced the function and induced the proliferation of autoreactive effec-tor T cells via over-activation of mTOR. Furthermore， the con-sumption of a moderate dose of sugar in the next 3 occasions might have been sufficient to enhance the effector T cell func-tion of a previously increased number of autoreactive T cells， and to weaken Treg cell function causing the mild and tran-sient recurrence of the symptoms. One may hypothesize that running down a mountain in the described individual's case might have caused microlesions to the knee， that usually are repaired by a physiological asymptomatic， transient inflam-matory process. However， in this case this coincided with ex-cessive sugar intake which we believe resulted in an over-ac-tivation of mTOR at the molecular level. This over-activation might have shifted the cellular balance towards a proinflam-matory state and weakened Treg suppressive function caus-ing gonarthritis and enthesitis .\n\n【16】Obviously， such a causal relation is not true for most people who consume sugar. The term mosaic of autoimmunity， coined by Yehuda Shoenfeld， allude to the many factors contributing to pathological autoimmunity . Every individual affected by autoimmune diseases might have their own mosaic of contrib-uting factors. In some individuals excessive sugar intake might be a piece of their mosaic of contributing factors， and in cer-tain circumstances， might function as a trigger of pathologi-cal autoimmunity as was probably repeatedly the case in the described patient. In this patient the enthesitis/arthritis pain recurred following sugar consumption and disappeared after strict avoidance of sugar in 4 occasions .\n\n【17】The positive family history for autoimmune thyroiditis allude to a possible genetic predisposition for autoimmune diseases. It is thought that genetic predisposition is a prerequisite for most autoimmune diseases . A body mass index of 25.4 kg/m2despite regular physical activity (hiking in the mountains) indi-cates overnutrition and， hence， additional metabolic pressure as well as increased production of adipokines (leptin) might have contributed to a proinflammatory state. Leptin， the adi-pose tissue derived hormone， is known to regulate T cell pro-liferation and cytokine production and to contribute to acti-vation of the mTOR pathway in Treg cells .Leptin concentration is proportional to fat mass and is positively asso-ciated with overweight and increased susceptibility to chronic inflammation and autoimmune diseases. Leptin or leptin recep-tor knock out mice display resistance to autoimmune disor-ders including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis， experimental colitis， Ag-induced arthritis， and type 1 diabetes mellitus . Little is known about the effect of food contain-ing sugar or other high refined carbohydrates on gut microbi-ota， which in turn influence the immune system.\n\n【18】The recent discoveries of the molecular mechanisms and sig-naling pathways upstream and downstream of mTOR that drive the oscillation of anabolic and catabolic metabolism and determined differentiation and function of T cells， might contribute to the understanding the described case and the reported epidemiological observations. Thus， this suggests a potential causal association between increased sugar intake and inflammatory or autoimmune reactions， at least in indi-viduals with hypothetic deficits of the various mTOR antago-nizing molecular mechanisms. Because of the complexity of the immune system regulation including the induction andmaintenance of immune tolerance by T cells， it may be dif-ficult to prove such a hypothesis. Nevertheless， the scientific insights on the central regulatory role of the mTOR pathway regarding cell metabolism and its nutrient dependent activa-tion as well as its known impact on T cell differentiation， pro liferation， and function suggest a direct link between overnu-trition and inflammatory states. This is strengthened by results of epidemiological studies indicating that reduction of sugar intake could have a preventive effect on the risk for autoim-mune and other inflammatory diseases and could contribute to clinical improvement in some patients .\n\n【19】Conclusions\n\n【20】Avoiding excessive sugar intake and overnutrition and favor-ing the physiological oscillation between anabolic and cata-bolic metabolism due to physical activity and/or fasting might promote health and contribute to the prevention of autoim-mune and other diseases at least in genetically predisposed individuals. Individuals can try to avoid sugar intake and/or overnutrition， and try to exert more physical activity and/or fasting and observe if this is followed by short-term health benefits. The long-term benefits of such behavior regarding health and prevention of diseases have， for a long time， been widely accepted and demonstrated by epidemiological and in-terventional studies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

This is， to the best of our knowl-edge， the first reported case of a neonatal intussusception with a Meckel’s diverticulum as a lead point in a neurologi-cally impaired child.\n\n【11】Case Report\n\n【12】A term female infant presented at 22 days of age at our Emergency Department in severe condition due to suspected SBS. At admission， the patient was dyspneic and unresponsive；she was immediately intubated and transferred to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. A total-body ultrasound survey， mainly fo-cused on the brain， lungs， and abdomen， was performed and ex-cluded injuries to parenchymatous organs， except for the right adrenal gland， which appeared enlarged and inhomogeneous.\n\n【13】Eight days after hospitalization， a rectal stimulation was per-formed because of persistent constipation for 4 days， consid-ered secondary to the neurological impairment and to seda-tion with intravenous benzodiazepine. During the procedure， a sudden and isolated episode of rectal bleeding occurred， with-out any worsening of general condition or abdominal disten-sion. No signs of pneumoperitoneum or air-fluid levels were shown in the plain abdominal film， while the ultrasonography showed a \"doughnut sign\" with high suspicion of ileocecal in-tussusception . Immediately， a rectal barium contrast enema was performed： during the exam， the liquid contrast identified a minus image localized in the right inferior abdominal quadrant suggesting an ileocecal intussusception. Despite the presence of contrast within the ap-pendix， due to uncertainty about the efficacy of non-opera-tive management and to further investigate possible abdom-inal conditions， we decided to perform an abdominal CT scan， which showed persistent intussusception .\n\n【14】Exploratory laparotomy was planned. Intraoperatively， ileo-cecal intussusception with Meckel's diverticulum acting as a lead point was identified . The intussusception was manually reduced， a 15-cm segment of ischemic small bow-el， including the Meckel diverticulum， was resected with pres-ervation of the ileocecal valve， and an ileo-ileal anastomosis was performed.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Intussusception is the most common cause of intestinal ob-struction in children， with a peak incidence usually before the second year of age . In neonates it is a much rarer entity， with an incidence of about 1 case per 6000 . During an in-tussusception， a proximal portion of bowel pushes inside the adjacent distal segment， leading to intestinal obstruction and， eventually， vascular ischemia and necrosis . The etiology is often unknown， but in 10% of cases an anatomic lead point that predispose to the intussusception can be identified . The etiology of neonatal intussusception presents differences between full-term and premature infants： in full-term babies it is often associated with the presence of a lead point ， the most common being Meckel diverticulum， followed by polyps or duplications ， a malignancy is rarely detected. However， it has been hypothesized that perinatal risk of intestinal hy-poperfusion/hypoxia and dysmotility can act as a lead point for intussusception in premature infants .\n\n【17】About 90% of pediatric intussusceptions are located in the il-eocolic region . Classic manifestations of intussusception in children include crampy abdominal pain， usually accompanied by rectal bleeding， “red currant jelly\" stool， lethargy， and pres-ence of a palpable mass in the right lower abdominal quad-rant . Neonates with intussusception often manifest with non-specific symptoms， such as unstable general condition， abdominal distension， and haematochezia， more suggestive of other abdominal conditions such as necrotizing enterocoli-tis . The atypical presentation may lead to a delay in the di-agnosis and treatment， requiring operative management with extended bowel resection during surgery.\n\n【18】In our case， intussusception was diagnosed incidentally in a pa-tient with severe neurological impairment due to SBS brain injury. The abdominal clinical picture was non-specific and shaded by the neurological impairment with no worsening of general condi-tions， scanty abdominal symptoms， and rectal bleeding only af-ter stimulation. As the initial management consisted of support of vital conditions following SBS， we could not establish the ex-act timing of the intussusception； we might even suppose that the intussusception presented with classical signs of irritability and abdominal pain and it might have been the trigger for SBS.\n\n【19】Early management， either radiological or surgical， is manda-tory to prevent bowel necrosis. A rectal contrast enema is the treatment of choice， but this is usually avoided in neonates because of the high vulnerability of the intestine to perfora-tion and the high incidence of failure of non-operative treat-ment due to the delay in the diagnosis or the presence of a lead point. As a consequence， in neonates， surgical treatment in often considered the safest option . In our case， despite an initial trial of non-operative management， we ended up performing a laparotomy and bowel resection.\n\n【20】Conclusions\n\n【21】Intussusception is a rare entity in neonates and， when severe neurological impairment is present， the diagnosis can be missed because of the compromised condition of the baby and the pau-city of gastrointestinal manifestations.

Fever and respiratory symptom are two of the commonest complaint， but a small amount of patient can have gastrointestinal symptom only. COVID-19 patient with sole gastrointestinal symptom can be difficult to diagnose in clinical practice， especially if the patient does not have a fever. Hereby， we present three cases of confirmed COVID-19 patients who present with sole gastrointestinal symptom and discuss several important clues towards the diagnosis. COVID-19 can present with sole Gastrointestinal symptom. This should raise our awareness， especially in a country where active COVID-19 cases are stil high.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS COVID-19， Gastrointestinal symptom， Indonesia， SARS-COV-2\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Since first reported in December 2019， Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) have become a global public health crisis with at least 210 countries involved. This infectious disease caused by a novel beta coronavirus， Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2)， have brought on 46 million cases with 1.2 million deaths globally. Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 involved almost all organ system， particularly the respiratory system. Patients will present with fever， fatigue， myalgia， cough， sore throat， and dyspnea. However， extra-pulmonary symptom started to raise attention when the first COVID-19 case from the United States also had prominent gas-trointestinal symptoms with SARS-COV-2 nucleic acid detected from a faecal sample. COVID-19 patients also can present with the sole gastrointestinal symptom. A Study from China revealed that 3.2% of COVID-19 patients present only with gas-trointestinal symptoms of nausea， vomiting， and diarrhoea with-out respiratory symptom.  Current meta-analysis by Mao etal.， reported 10% of COVID-19 patients present with gastroin-testinal symptoms only. This should raise awareness， especially in countries where the COVID-19 burden is still high. In this article， we reported 3 cases of COVID-19 patients who present with sole Gastrointestinal symptom.\n\n【4】Case series\n\n【5】Case 1\n\n【6】Twenty-five years old gentleman presenting with diarrhoea for 1day prior to admission. He had 10x of bowel movement without mucus/blood. The patient also reported nausea， epigastric pain， and malaise. The patient denied any history of fever， cough， runny nose， sore throat， anosmia， ageusia， or shortness of breath. The patient worked as a laboratory analyst and conducted a nasopharyngeal swab on several COVID-19 positive patients. Physical examination was unremarkable except for increased bowel movement and epigastric tenderness. A laboratory test was shown in . Chest X-ray was normal. Given the high suspicion of COVID-19 infection， the patient was hospi-talized and treated as suspected COVID-19 infection. IV fluid， Zinc 2x20 mg po， and attapulgite as needed po was given. An oropharyngeal swab was taken， which come back positive for the SARS COV-2 virus. The rectal swab was not done due to our limitation. Azithromycin， chloroquine and oseltamivir were added to the regiment. The patient was discharged after 14 days without any complication.\n\n【7】Fifty-eight years old woman come with nausea and vomiting4 days prior to admission. The patient also had epigastric pain and non-inflammatory diarrhoea 1 day prior to admission. No fever， cough， runny nose， sore throat， anosmia， ageusia， or short-ness of breath was reported. The patient had hypertension but did not take medication regularly. The patient denied any con-tact with COVID-19 positive patients. Physical examination revealed blood pressure 160/95， epigastric tenderness and in-creased bowel sound. Another physical examination was un-remarkable. A laboratory test was shown in . Rapid test for SARS COV-2 antibody was negative. Chest X-ray  showed opacity in left paracardial and cardiomegaly. The patient was hospitalized as suspected COVID-19， Hyper-tension， and Acute Kidney Injury.

An oropharyngeal swab was taken and was positive for the SARS COV-2 virus. The rectal swab was not taken due to our limitation. Oseltamivir and Chloroquine were added to the regiment. The patient was discharged later without complica-tion.\n\n【8】Case 3\n\n【9】41 years old gentleman come with epigastric pain 3 days prior to admission. The pain was non-radiating，sharp， and accom-panied by nausea. No hematemesis/melena was reported. His symptom started with diarrhoea and fatigue five days prior to admission. No mucus/blood reported in the stool. The patient did not have any fever， cough， runny nose， sore throat， anosmia， ageusia， or shortness of breath. No history of Diabetes Mellitus， Hypertension， or Asthma. The patient worked as a driver and denied any contact with COVID-19 confirmed case. Physical ex-amination was unremarkable except for epigastric tenderness. A laboratory test was shown in . Rapid test Ig M antibody for SARS COV-2 was positive. Chest X-ray  showed opacities in both paracardial of the lung. The patient was treated as suspected COVID-19， transaminitis， and acute kidney injury. IV fluid， omeprazole 1x40mg iv， ondansetron 3x8mg iv， Zinc3x20mg po， curcuma 3x1 tab， attapulgite as needed po， and lev-ofloxacin 1x750mg iv was given. An oropharyngeal swab was taken and was positive for the SARS COV-2 virus. The rectal swab was not obtained due to our limitation. Oseltamivir was added to the regiment. The patient finished his isolation in the hospital and discharged without any complication.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】We reported three cases of COVID-19 with the sole gastrointesti-nal symptom. This can be tricky in clinical practice， given most COVID-19 patients present with the respiratory symptom. An early report from Wuhan describe the cough as the second most common (76%) clinical symptoms at the onset of illness after fever (98%)， Sputum production was found in 28% of patients， and dyspnoea was developed in 55% of patients. Chen et al.， found fever in 83% of patients， cough in 82% of patients and shortness of breath in 31% of patients.\n\n【12】The main mechanism for SARS-COV-2 to infect cells is through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors. Current literature showed ACE-2 receptors are expressed in more than 150 different human's cells， including the stomach gland， small intestine， colon， rectal epithelia， and cholangiocyte.\n\n| Case No.  |  | Hb  | WBC  |  |  |  | Platelet  | ALT/AST  | Ur/Cr  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Case No.  | Sex/Age  | (g/dL)  | (g/dL)  | Diff.

During the early phase of the infection (viral phase)， SARS-COV-2 will cause enterocyte dysfunction induced by in crease intestinal permeability. Microbial dysbiosis due to intesti-nal barrier disintegrity will activate both innate and adaptive immune cells， causing systemic inflammation and gastrointesti-nal injury. Therefore， COVID-19， especially in the early phase， can present with the gastrointestinal symptom.\n\n【17】The increasing number of COVID-19 patient with sole gas-trointestinal symptom reported from literature  has been addressed by the current World Health Organization(WHO) COVID-19 case definition. Patient defined as suspected COVID-19 case if they meet clinical and epidemiological crite-ria. Clinical criteria comprise of either the acute onset of fever and cough； or acute onset of any three or more of the follow-ing symptoms (fever， cough， fatigue， headache， myalgia， sore throat， coryza， dyspnoea， anorexia/nausea/vomiting， diarrhoea， and altered mental status). Based on the current WHO COVID-19 case definition， patient linked with epidemiological factors， which have fever， nausea， and diarrhoea， have already fulfilled the suspected COVID-19 criteria. Furthermore， if a patient's chest imaging findings are suggestive of COVID-19， they will be categorized as probable COVID-19 case.\n\n【18】Patient in Case 1 present with diarrhoea， nausea， and epi-gastric pain. No history of fever and respiratory symptom， making a diagnosis of COVID-19 less likely at a glance. How-ever， the patient had a very high Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio(14.7) and low Absolute Lymphocyte Count ， combined with his occupational status， which raised the possibility of COVID-19. Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) is one of the haematological parameter used as an inflammatory marker. COVID-19 will cause severe inflammatory response leading to circulatory white blood cell change. Inflammatory cytokine will increase the neutrophils production， which will lead to an in-crease of Arginase， Nitric Oxide (NO)， and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). Those compounds will suppress the production and hamper the function of T lymphocyte. In conclusion， the more inflammation takes place， the higher NLR and lower ALC can be found.\n\n【19】Patient in Case 2 and Case 3 also present with gastrointesti-nal predominance symptom (nausea， vomiting， epigastric pain， and non-inflammatory diarrhoea). No history of contact with confirmed COVID-19 patient noted in both cases. However， we found a slight decrease in ALC and increase monocyte per-centage from WBC differential count. This is following a study by Peng et al.， which showed that patient with COVID-19would have lower lymphocyte count (1.30±0.57 vs 2.00±0.41×\n\n【20】109/L，P<.001) and higher monocyte percentage (7.71±2.61%vs 5.79±1.26%，P<.001) compared with a healthy subject. In-creased cytokines (IL-6and IFN-&) and chemokines (IL-8， CXCL-10， and CCL-5) are hypothesized to contribute to the increased peripheral blood monocytes in this patient. Both patients had reduced kidney function， probably from dehydration-induced pre-renal injury. Another highlight from our case series is pa-tient in Case 2 and Case 3 had a discrepancy between clinical symptom and Chest X-ray. Even though both patients did not have any respiratory symptom， but we found bilateral infil-trates on their Chest X-ray. Tenda et al.， found a similar phenomenon on their case series in which two of three patients had absent respiratory symptom but had Chest X-ray suggestive of pneumonia. Specifically， they stressed the positive Chest CT findings in all of their patients before RT-PCR confirmed the diagnosis. One retrospective study from Japan also mentions the clinical -radiologic dissociation phenomenon in COVID-19. They found lung opacities on Chest CT in 54% of COVID-19asymptomatic cases. Patient with asymptomatic cases showed more Ground Glass Opacities (GGO) than consolidation pattern on Chest CT. A case series from a family cluster in China also mention two COVID-19 patients with positive Chest CT findings on admission whose develop respiratory symptom lat-ter on their disease course. Since the COVID-19 patient’s gastrointestinal symptom usually occur in the early course of the disease， with pneumonia or other respiratory complications develop in the progressive/late phase， we hypothesize that the positive Chest X-ray finding may precede the pneumonic symptom. However， further study is needed to confirm this finding.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n\n【22】Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) can present with sole gas-trointestinal manifestation. Health care worker should be cau-tious and use a comprehensive approach， including clinical， epidemiological，laboratory， and radiological data， in order to diagnose this disease accurately.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

These models were developed when medical information in a consultation setting was limited and controlled by doctors. The internet has changed the information imbalance. Patients now have access to vast amounts of medical information independent of their doctors. The current， non-evidence based， zeitgeist favours well-informed patients and believes that this has a net positive benefit. Evidence from healthcare outcomes with highly informed patients such as physician patients suggests the opposite. We argue that this arises due to a phenomenon， noted in the industry， called Data Rich Information Poor (DRIP). DRIP points to an underlying relationship between information and benefit as being inversely U'shaped. This DRIP state is negatively impacting the benefit of medical consultations. An ICE consultation model worsens the situation by leading to further information and needs to be either suspended or throttled.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Consultation model， Ideas Concerns Expectations (ICE)， Data Rich Information Poor (DRIP)\n\n【2】Challenging patients are traditionally defined as those who are \"medically challenging， interpersonally difficult，psychiatri-cally ill， chronically medically ill， or lacking in social support.\" In 1978 Groves attempted to understand the reasons motivat-ing such patients， classing them as dependent clingers， entitled demanders， manipulative help-rejecters and self-destructive de-niers. Both descriptions have an underlying assumption that the term patient implies a person whose knowledge of medical information， on average， is significantly less than that of the doctor. Today family doctors face a new and increasing type of challenging patient'fuelled by a relatively recent phenomena：information. Well-informed the explosion of the internet， medi-cal information was less freely available to patients， and most reliable information was largely under the control of doctors， which favours in controlled aliquots during consultations. In the current social media and advanced internet search age， the information gap has been significantly reduced. In some cases， ithas been reversed. The internet informed patient can induce fear in family doctors who worry about coming across as ignorant， incompetent and being undervalued. The new driver for the insatiable demand for health services is information.\n\n【3】The current zeitgeist favours well-informed patients and be-lieves that this has a net positive benefit. Hence we see multiple and well-funded sites that promote high-quality information such as www.nhs.uk offering a “complete guide\" for a com-prehensive list of health conditions. The impact of readily available and large amounts of health information for patients on the effectiveness and efficiency of family doctor consultations undervalued not been studied.\n\n【4】Physicians， as patients， possibly represent the most informed patients of all. Ironically， their informed state results in more negatives than positives. They deny their symptoms， self-diagnoses and self prescribe， all of which can lead to deficient care-seeking.  This seems to indicate that there is likely to be an underlying principle of diminishing returns when it comes to the informed patient.\n\n【5】We know that consultation length increases where consulta-tions are more patient-centred or involve urban versus rural pa-tients . Both of these factors can be explained by the quantity of information that needs to be exchanged in such consultations. In the high-quality the doctor is the greater source of informa-tion such as ‘There is a new study on this topic'， We have thefollowing options.' followed by a list that needs further elab-oration. People living in urban environments are more likely to be exposed to more people， well-funded advertising， a quicker pace of life than their rural counterparts. Overall this will result in them being exposed to and aware of， more information in general， and medical information in particular. If the underlying information explanation is valid how can the family doctor deal with the consequences of this on the consultation? Can there ever be too much information in a consultation? If yes， what is an effective strategy to deal with it?\n\n【6】The concept of Data-Rich Information Poor (DRIP) has been around at least since1976 with an article published by Altman describing public service organizations who were facing this is-sue. It was an attempt to work out why organisations， driven from the early 1900's to collect huge amounts of data to improve their efficiency， were finding it increasingly difficult to translate the data into effective decisions for improvement. What they realised was that organisations were effectively drowning in data， they were unable to sift out the relevant data， information， from the irrelevant. The journey of organisations from the early1900's to the current day mirrors the way the consultation model is evolving between patients and doctors， especially over the last decade.\n\n【7】The information-to-benefit curve is an inverted U'shaped curve. Too little information and there is insufficient information to act upon， too much and the information is lost in a snowstorm of irrelevant information. The effectiveness of consultation as a function of the information exchanged is likely to be similarly related. Where the information gap between the doctor and the patient is very large， the doctor spends a lot of time and effort to bridge the gap-effectively educating the patient but at the cost of losing time in the fixed-length consultation. Where the information is too much， both the doctor and patient， have to spend more time dealing with irrelevant information， once again at the cost of reducing the time to deal with relevant information.\n\n【8】Given this understanding， doctors need to have a modified strategy to make the consultation more efficient. Traditionally， family doctors are trained to elicit Ideas， Concerns and Expecta-tions (ICE) to achieve better consultation outcomes. Where the information level of the consultation has reached a saturation point， especially when the patient has been the main contributor， the doctor has to be careful not to add more information into the consultation mix. The element that is under the doctor's control is the ICE process by which more information is elicited from the patient. Patients as independent agents’ will have a great desire to share their information and this desire is naturally difficult to control.\n\n【9】Further， not being experts in consultation skills， they will not be able to appreciate the unexpected consequences of their desire to share information. To prevent information saturation and an inefficient consultation outcome， family doctors， in such situations， have to suspend their trained response and throttle the information. In other words， we have to put the ICE back in the freezer to prevent a harmful DRIP.\n\n【10】CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n\n【11】The authors declare no conflict of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

There are 3 common motile Aeromonas strain pathogens related to humans，namely， A caviae， A sobria and A. hydrophila. A. hydrophila isthe most common Aeromonas strain in humans. While the overall frequency of Aeromonas as a cause of gram-negative bacteremia is low， Aeromonas bacteremia has a high fatali-ty rate .\n\n【10】In this report， we present a patient with fulminant A. hydrophila septicemia and endotoxin shock after surgery for coronary artery bypass grafts and mitral annuloplas-ty. Clinicians should be aware of the virulence of this rare organism.\n\n【11】CASE REPORT\n\n【12】In February 2010，an 81-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with complaints of exertional chest pain and dys-pnea. In 1998， he was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyop athy and chronic renal dysfunction. Beta-adrenergic antag-onist therapy was initiated. In 2002， he was diagnosed with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and oral amiodarone was start-ed. In 2009， he was diagnosed with interstitial pneumoni-tis and steroid therapy was started. In that period， cardiac echocardiography showed left ventricular generalized hy-pokinesis and the ejection fraction was 45%.\n\n【13】On admission， his heart rate was 92 bpm， blood pressure was78/59 mmHg， and body temperature was 36.5°C. He took oral steroids 15 mg/day. The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 80 bpm and ST depression in leads II，III， aVF， V4， 5， 6. His chest radiograph showed cardiomega-ly (cardiothoracic ratio 65%) and pulmonary congestion. His laboratory findings on admission were as follows： white blood cell count，7，520/mm²， C-reactive protein level，0.08mg/dL， hemoglobin was 9.6 g/dL， and liver functions， nor-mal. Serum creatine phosphokinase level， 34 IU/L (normal，<216IU/L). Blood urea nitrogen level 58.7 mg/dL， creati-nine level， 2.48 mg/dL， estimated glomerular filtration rate，20.3mL/min/1.73 m² and sialylated carbohydrate antigen KL-61evel，163 U/mL (normal， <500U/mL). Brain natriuret-ic peptide (BNP) levels were remarkably elevated at 1989.7pg/mL (normal， <20 pg/mL). Cardiac echocardiography showed left ventricular severe hypokinesis， ejection fraction of 29%， and severe mitral regurgitation due to tethering.\n\n【14】The patient received initial treatment with bed rest， oxygen administration， salt restriction， increase in diuretics， and continuous infusion of low-dose carperitide.\n\n【15】Although his symptoms and BNP improved gradually， he still experienced chest pain during bathroom walking. The coronary angiogram by cardiac catheterization showed very severe stenotic lesions in the left anterior descending artery and the right coronary artery.\n\n【16】In March 2010， surgery for coronary artery bypass grafts and mitral annuloplasty were performed. He received intravenous administration of ampicillin-sulbactam asprophylaxis against postoperative infection (3 g/day， twice a day). However， 2 days after surgery， he suddenly developed a high-grade fever， and his hemodynamics deteriorated rap-idly. The endotoxin concentration of his blood was elevated to 408 pg/mL (normal， <5 pg/mL). Septic and endotoxin shock were strongly suspected， 4 blood cultures were ob-tained immediately. All of 4 blood cultures revealed gram-negative coccobacilli. Ciprofloxacin (600 mg/day) and hu-man immunoglobulin (5.0 g) were started. Resuscitative efforts， including endotoxin adsorption therapy with a col-umn of polymyxin B-immobilized fibers， intra-aortic bal-loon pumps， and percutaneous cardiopulmonary support were performed.\n\n【17】Table 1.

Another 2 days later， the bacterium was identified as A. hydrophila. This bacterium was not sus-ceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam .\n\n【20】DISCUSSION\n\n【21】Aeromonas are gram-negative， non-spore forming rods. Aeromonas are ubiquitous bacteria that are native to aquat-ic environments， and have been found in fresh， brackish， estuarine， marine， chlorinated， and unchlorinated water supplies worldwide.\n\n【22】Miles and Halnan were the first to report the isolation of an Aeromonas strain from the feces of a patient . Thereare 3 common motile Aeromonas strain pathogens relatedto humans， namely， A caviae， A sobria and A. hydrophila. A.\n\n【23】hydrophila is the most common Aeromonas in humans. In a normal human host， infection with Aeromonas may produce mild diarrhea and， accasionally， cellulites. However， severe Aeromonas infection occurs when the host defense is com-promised. Aeromonas causes a variety of systemic infections. By far the most serious and life-threatening complication of systemic Aeromonas infection is Aeromonas septicemia. The3 species (A. caviae， A. sobria and A. hydrophila) account for>95% of Aeromonas septicemia . The majority of patients with Aeromonas septicemia have a history of leukemia ， other malignant diseases， or hepatobiliary disease . In our patient， some predisposing factors have been identified. Just after surgery for coronary artery bypass grafts and mi-tral annuloplasty， the renal failure and oral administration of steroids might be adversely affected.\n\n【24】While the overall frequency of Aeromonas as a cause of gram-negative septicemia is exceedingly low (<0.15%) in one previous survey ， the fatality rate for Aeromonas septice-mia is very high. In 1988， Janda et al. reported that the fa-tality rate for Aeromonas septicemia has exceeded 50%. Lau et al. reported that the overall mortality rate among 42Aeromonas septicemia was 64%， and nineteen patients (70%) died within 7 days after the Aeromonas bacteremia . Ko et al. reported that the overall fatality rate at 14 days among104 Aeromonas septicemia cases was 32%， and two-thirds of the deaths occurred within 72 h after the patients' arrival at the hospital . In a recent report， Kang et al. evaluat-ed the clinical significance of Aeromonas septicemia in 182patients. The mortality directly related to Aeromonas septi-cemia was still 24.1%.\n\n【25】Aeromonas species produce beta-lactamase， and they are of-ten reported to be resistant to penicillin， ampicillin， first-generation cephalosporin， carbenicillin，vancomycin， and clindamycin. Antibiotics include third-generation cephalo-sporins， aztreonam and imipenem， or a fluoroquinolone is consistently effective against Aeromonas species . A recent report demonstrated that either ciprofloxacin or azithro-mycin is recommended as first-line drug in patients with Aeromonas infection . In our patient， l day after cardiac surgery， cultures of sputum grew A.hydrophila. The patient did not have symptoms of either abdominal pain or diar-rhea， the primary portal of entry might have been the re-spiratory tract. Unfortunately， like the blood culture， the organism from sputum was resistant to ampicillin-sulbac-tam， which was administerated as prophylaxis against post-operative infection.\n\n【26】Aeromonas produce an array of virulence factors that include endotoxin. Endotoxin is one of the principal components on the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. Endotoxin causes the release of cytokines such as interleukin-l and tu-mor necrosis factor-alpha and activates complements and co-agulation factors. Endotoxin is considered one of the prin-cipal biological substances that cause gram-negative septic shock. In this case， the endotoxin concentration of the pa-tient’s blood was elevated to 408 pg/mL (normal， <5pg/ml)， thus the patient's condition might have been adversely af-fected by endotoxin. The polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column is a medical device that aims to remove circulating endotoxin by absorption .In patients with Aeromonas sep-tic shock， the use of polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column should be considered without hesitation.\n\n【27】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【28】Clinicians should be aware of the virulence of Aeromonas.\n\n【29】Although rare， bloodstream infections caused by Aeromonas tend to be very severe and progress rapidly. Therefore， when Aeromonas is found in a patient’s bloodstream， clini-cians should start appropriate and intensive treatment im-mediately， including vigorous pulmonary and cardiovascu-lar support.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Gastric MC may be seen with solid organ transplantation， use of aluminum-containing antacids or sucralfate， malignancy， and chronic renal failure. While the incidence of gastric MC in renal transplant pa-tients undergoing gastric biopsy is common (between 15-29%)， to our knowledge esophageal MC has only been previously reported 3 times.\n\n【2】Case Report： A 68-year-old male dialysis-dependent end stage renal disease status-post deceased donor kidney transplant underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for dysphagia and diffuse esophageal wall thickening seen on imaging studies. EGD demonstrated diffuse， circumferential thick white esophageal plaques and mucosal friability. Esophageal biopsies demonstrated erosive esophagitis with basophilic calcium deposits within the fibrinopurulent exudate and squamous mucosa. Stains for fungal organisms and viruses were negative. A di-agnosis of esophageal MC was made. Although the patient had a protracted postoperative course after trans-plantation， he had improvement of the esophageal wall thickening on imaging after transplantation.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】Esophageal MC is a rare phenomenon and all of the previously reported cases of esophageal MC， including our case， have been in patients with end stage renal disease who were on dialysis. Although prolonged hypercal-cemia and hyperphosphatemia， an elevated calcium-phosphorus product， and associated underlying inflam-mation are likely key etiologic factors， the pathogenesis of esophageal MC is not fully understood and is like-ly due to multiple collective etiologies. Likewise， more reported cases are likely to increase our understanding of the clinical significance and management of this rare disorder.\n\n【5】MeSH Keywords： Calcinosis ·Calciphylaxis·Esophageal Diseases\n\n【6】When mucosal calcinosis (MC) occurs in the gastrointesti-nal tract it most commonly affects the gastric mucosa， while esophageal involvement is rare . There are numerous as sociated conditions identified for gastric MC including solid or-gan transplantation， use of aluminum-containing antacids or sucralfate， malignancy， and chronic renal failure. Rarely some cases of gastric MC may be idiopathic in etiology . The reported cases of esophageal MC have been in patients with similar associated conditions， especially end stage renal dis-ease which was present in all 3 previously reported cases . The reported incidence of gastric MC in renal transplant pa-tients undergoing gastric biopsy is relatively high (between15-29%)  but esophageal MC has only been previously reported 3 times . The most common presenting symp-tom of esophageal MC appears to be dysphagia. It may also be a rare cause of an episode of upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding . Given the limited experience with this disease， the treatment is not entirely clear； however， some of the re-ported cases have utilized intravenous sodium thiosulfate in an attempt to improve the condition .\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】A 68-year-old male with dialysis-dependent end stage renal disease due to type 2 diabetes mellitus recently status-post deceased donor kidney transplant underwent an esophagogas-troduodenoscopy (EGD) for dysphagia and diffuse esophageal wall thickening seen on computed tomography (CT) scan . Prior to transplantation， the patient had been dialysis de-pendent for 5 years (hemodialysis). EGD demonstrated diffuse，circumferential thick white esophageal plaques  and mucosal friability. Esophageal biopsies demonstrated erosive esophagitis with active (neutrophilic) inflammation and frag-ments of fibrinopurulent debris. There were extensive baso-philic deposits within the squamous mucosa and fibrinopu-rulent debris . A stain for fungal organisms (Gomori methenamine silver) and immunohistochemical stains for her-pes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus were all negative. A von Kossa stain for calcium was positive highlighting the ba-sophilic deposits within the squamous mucosa and the fibrino-purulent exudate， confirming that the mucosal deposits were calcium . Review of medications revealed use of su-cralfate and the patient was noted to have an elevated calci-um-phosphorus product. The patient had a prolonged hospi-tal course after transplantation and was ultimately discharged home. There was some improvement in the esophageal wall thickening seen on CT scan but not complete resolution. Thepatient was alive 12 months post diagnosis of esophageal MC and his calcium and phosphorus levels normalized after transplantation. He did not receive specific pharmacothera-peutic interventions (i.e.， sodium thiosulfate) targeting solely the esophageal MC while hospitalized.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Gastrointestinal tract mucosal calcinosis (MC) may be dystro-phic， metastatic， iatrogenic， or idiopathic in etiology. The most frequent of these is metastatic calcification in normal tissue secondary to hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia.Dystrophic calcification refers to calcium deposition in damaged tissues without hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia. latrogenic cal-cification occurs secondary to pharmacotherapeutic interven-tion (i.e.， sucralfate or calcium therapy). Idiopathic calcification occurs in normal tissues without hypercalcemia or hyperphos-phatemia . Rarely， gastric MC has been reported without an associated condition in which case it may be considered idiopathic in etiology . MC may be secondary to multiple factors including renal transplantation， sucralfate therapy， an elevated calcium-phosphorus product， and/or dystrophic cal-cification in inflamed/eroded mucosa . All of the report-ed cases of esophageal MC， including our case， have been in patients with end stage renal disease and it seems that the most important etiologic factor in these cases was hypercal-cemia or hyperphosphatemia in renal disease (i.e.， metastat-ic calcification) .\n\n【11】Of the few reported cases， esophageal MC typically presents most commonly with dysphagia and/or upper gastrointesti-nal tract bleeding . The endoscopic findings range from plaque-like areas to nodules and/or ulceration， similar to ourcase which demonstrated diffuse white plaque-like areas and ulceration . Endoscopically， these deposits may resemble candidiasis or eosinophilic abscesses . Histologically， there are basophilic intraepithelial deposits of calcium within the squamous mucosa often associated with erosions/ulcerated mucosa. There is also associated active (neutrophilic) inflam-mation in the squamous mucosa . The calcium deposits are positive on von Kossa stain. The histologic differential diagno-sis mainly includes other mucosal deposits especially iron depo-sition. Iron deposits tend to be yellow-brown in color and will be positive on iron staining. Another consideration， particular-ly in renal failure patients， is sevelamer or kayexalate crystal deposition. Sevelamer is an ion exchange resin used to lower phosphate levels in chronic kidney disease. Histologically， the crystals demonstrate a broad， curved \"fish scale\" appearance and usually a 2-toned bright pink and rusty yellow background appearance. Kayexalate is another ion exchange resin used to lower potassium levels in chronic kidney disease. Kayexalate crystals demonstrate a narrower“fish scale” pattern and the crystals are violet on hematoxylin and eosin stained slides .\n\n【12】In all 3 of the previously reported cases of esophageal MC， the patients also had calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA) or calciphylaxis which has a mortality rate approaching 60-80%and in 2 of these cases the patients died . The patient in the current case did not have evidence of calciphylaxis. Calciphylaxis is usually associated with painful， violaceous skin lesions and has only rarely been reported in the gastro-intestinal tract， once in the rectum and twice in the esopha-gus . Histologically， there is concentric calcification of vessel walls . Therefore， if esophageal MC is associated with calciphylaxis， it may be a harbinger of a poor outcome. Attempts to treat the dysphagia and esophageal calcium de-posits with intravenous sodium thiosulfate do not appear to alter the esophageal deposits， the endoscopic findings， or， in the cases with calciphylaxis， the course of the disease . Currently the appropriate treatment of esophageal MC is un-clear and there is no definitive pharmacotherapeutic man-agement that appears to clear or lessen the calcium deposits within the esophageal mucosa . However， in one of the reported cases there was \"modest improvement\" in symptoms with the use of sodium thiosulfate and cinacalcet (a calcium mimetic agent).\n\n【13】Conclusions\n\n【14】In summary， esophageal MC is a rare phenomenon or at least the paucity of reports in the literature would suggest as much. Gastrointestinal tract MC may be associated with numerous conditions and the etiology and the pathogenesis is likely mul-tifactorial. From the cases in the literature and our current case， it appears that dialysis-dependent end stage renal disease isthe largest risk factor for esophageal MC. More reported cas-es are needed to truly understand the etiology， treatment， and outcome of esophageal MC", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

He had undergone bilateral ureterosigmoidostomy ten years ago after a car accident which caused bladder rupture. Laboratory investigations revealed severe hypokalaemia 1.8 mmol/l(normal range 3.5-5.5 mmol/l). The patient was treated with intravenous potassium chloride and also received oral potassium chloride and acetozalamide. Patient’s clinical condition dramatically improved within 72 hours concomitant with the correction of serum potassium. We present a patient with secondary quadriparesis due to severe hypokalemia caused by ureterosigmoidostomy.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】Hypokalemia should be considered in differential diagnosis of patients with any degree of paresis in patients with a history of ureterosigmoidostomy.\n\n【6】Key words： Hypokalemia · tetraparesis·ureterosigmoidostomy· paresis\n\n【7】BACKGROUND\n\n【8】Ureterosigmoidostomy is the anastomosis of one or more ureters directly into the sigmoid due to removal of urinary bladder or disfunctioning. The reports of this procedure can be found in the medical literature since 1870. At present， this technique is rarely used but still some workers believe it is rather simple in comparison to newer operative techniques. In addition it provides a normal body image with perfect social integration and normal sexual behavior in the long-term. The complications include hyperchloremic aci-dosis， hypokalemia with nephropathy， pyelonephritis and development of colonic malignancy . With the usage of isolated loops of ileum， jejenum or colon， taken as urine conduits， the incidence of electrolyte abnormalities has considerably declined . We report a case of quadriparesis secondary to severe hypokalemia caused by ureterosigmoidostomy.\n\n【9】CASE REPORT\n\n【10】A twenty-four years old young man was admitted to the hospital with tetraparesis. The weakness was gradual in onset and had started in lower limbs and in few hours upper limbs were also involved. He had undergone bilateral ureterosigmoidostomy ten years ago after a car accident which caused bladder rupture.\n\n【11】On physical examination he was conscious and afe-brile. His blood pressure was110/70 mmHg and pulse was 80 beats per minute. There were no pulmonary or cardiac abnormalities. Neurological examination re-vealed generalized muscle weakness and diminished deep tendon reflexes. There were no abnormal cra-nial nerve findings or pathological reflexes. Sensory loss was not detected. Swallowing and breathing capacity were not disturbed. Laboratory investi-gations revealed severe hypokalaemia 1.8 mmol/l(normal range 3.5-5.5 mmol/l)， serum sodium was142 mmol/l (normal range 135-150 mmol/L)， serum calsium 7.6 mmol/l (normal range 8.4-11 mg/dl.)， Urea was 144 mg (normal range 15-50 mg/dl)， cre-atinin 1.17 mg/dl (normal range 0.6-1.1 mg/dl) cre-atinin kinase 738 U/L (normal range 38-254 U/L). His hemoglobin concentration was15.8 gr/dl (normal range11.7-16.1 g/dL.)， white blood cell count was14 x10^3/mikroL (normal range 4.5-11 x10^3/mikroL.). His serum Vit B 12 concentration was136 pg/ml (normal range 120-914 pg/ml.) and his Thyroid stimulating hormone and sT4，sT3 levels were normal. The ECG showed hypokalemic U waves. Chest X-ray was normal. A computed tomography scan of head was done to rule out a stroke or mass and was negative. Ultrasound examination of theupper abdomen (including surrenal gland) showed no pathological lesions. Colonoscopy showed no signs of malignancy.\n\n【12】The patient was treated with intravenous potassium chloride and also received oral potassium chloride and acetozalamide. Patient’s clinical condition dra-matically improved within 72 hours concomitant with the correction of serum potassium. Questioning from the patient at this stage revealed that he had not been taking acetozalamide treatment prescribed to him after the surgical procedure. He was discharged on oral potassium tablet and acetozalamide for preven-tion of hypokalemia.\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n\n【14】Implantation of the ureters into the gut is commonly used for reconstruction of the urinary tract after extirpa-tive surgery or bladder extrophy. A well known problem of diversion of urine through intestinal segments is the development of metabolic complications . Metabolic abnormalities such as hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and hypokalaemia may occur .\n\n【15】Severe hypokalemia is an important metabolic compli-cation. Because urinary concentration of potas-sium is much higher than the serum concentration it is assumed that the rectosigmoid would absorb urine potassium thereby preventing the development of hy-pokalemia. It has been shown， indeed that the ileum is able to reabsorb potassium. Patients with an ileal con-duit do not encounter hypokalemia and have normal potassium body stores. The distal colon is less likely to reabsorb potassium. In one third of patients with ureterosigmoidostomy， hypokalemia and depletion of total body potassium have in fact been observed. Due to renal tubular dysfunction secondary to repeated episodes of pyelonephritis， prolonged1115urine retention in the colon and hypomagnesaemia， metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia in patients with an ureterosigmoidostomy may worsen.\n\n【16】Since most of the potassium lost from the body is from interstitial fluid compartment， losses occur from a vol-ume about twice extra-cellular fluid volume or about40% body weight. Potassium deficit can be calculated by using Formula (potassium deficit in mmol= (nor-mal potassium-measured potassium) x0.4xbody weight in kgs). When administering intravenous potassium preparation， infusion concentration should not exceed40-60 mmol/l . In extremely ill patients， immediate aggressive supplementing might be life saving.\n\n【17】Bicarbonate and potassium should be administered both orally and intravenously to prevent complicationsof hypokalemia including ventriculer arrhytmias and cardiac arrest. Correction of acidosis without potassium replacement might be dangerous， due to progressive paralysis . For this reason， during intravenous potassium therapy， patient’s rhythm， heart rate，ECG tracings and serum potassium levels should be monitored.\n\n【18】In stable patients severe deteriorations of the electro-lyte abnormalities can be avoided by daily dosing of oral potassium and bicarbonate， forbidding of chloride intake， regular emptying of the colon and timely apply-ing of antibiotics in case of renal infection .\n\n【19】The differential diagnosis should be made for periodic paralysis. Thyrotoxic hypokalemic periodic paralysis， laxative abuse， severe diarrhea， alcohol abuse， use of amphotericin B must be considered and essential tests should be done for diagnosis.\n\n【20】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【21】We present a patient with secondary quadriparesis due to severe hypokalemia caused by ureterosigmoid-ostomy. By regular therapy of oral potassium in such circumstances can be avoided. Such patients should be evaluated and treated rapidly.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "623d9d36-30f5-48cb-8c12-0be1086c1dec", "title": null, "text": "【0】ABSTRACT Introduction： Light skin tone has been desired by many Asian women thus the search for effective depigmenting agent. Tranexamic acid， an antifibrinolytic drug， is now gaining popularity as a new depigmenting agent. However， studies on tranexamic acid have shown the mixed result of its comparison to hydroquinone. Galactomyces ferment filtrate， niacinamide and alpha arbutin have been known of their depigmenting effect. Combined materials with different targeting mechanisms are used to enhance the effectiveness of the lighting agent. Objective： To compare the skin lightening effect of the combination of tranexamic acid 3%， galactomyces ferment filtrate 2%， niacinamide 4%， and alpha arbutin 2% to hydroquinone 4%. Methods： In this study， each of 30 participants applied a combination of tranexamic acid 3%， galactomyces ferment filtrate 2%， niacinamide 4%， and alpha arbutin 2% and hydroquinone 4% to the left forearm using a particular patron. The subject then evaluated each week for four weeks. Clinical effects were evaluated using a chromameter including L\\* for skin brightness and a\\* for skin erythema. All measurements were taken three times， and the mean value was used. To assess the comparison of skin brightness score and pigmentation intensity between the two serum groups， the Independent T-test was used. As for assessing the change in scores based on measurement time in each serum group， Pearson’s Correlation was used. The test results are significant if the value of p <0.05. Results： Skin brightness (L\\*)， as measured by chromameter， when sample first came (T0) on the area applied with serum combination of tranexamic acid 3% got the average of brightness of skin 56，81， whereas in the area applied4% hydroquinone got the average brightness of skin 55，66. In the last control of the area applied a serum combination of3% tranexamic acid had an average skin brightness of 58.34 and the area applied with 4% hydroquinone serum had an average skin brightness of 57.48. There was a significant increase of skin brightness of the skin both in the area applied with tranexamic acid 3% (p <0.05) serum combination and in the area applied with hydroquinone 4% serum (p <0.01). The degree of decreased a\\* score was higher in combination with tranexamic acid 3% serum than hydroquinone serum， i.e. 0.314 compared to 0.221. Conclusion： Serum combination of tranexamic acid 3%， galactomyces ferment filtrate 2%， niacinamide 4% and alpha arbutin 2% can be considered as a safe and effective option to increase skin brightness with no significant side effect.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS depigmenting， tranexamic acid， galactomyces ferment filtrate， niacinamide， alpha arbutinHuman skin colour is one of the most apparent phenotypic vari-ations among humans and is determined primarily by the type and amount of melanin synthesized in melanosomes and the distribution patterns of melanosomes in melanocytes. Getting brighter skin tone has attracted much interest in the world， es-pecially for the dark-skinned groups in Asia and Africa with the Fitzpatrick IV-V skin type.  Recognizing the increasing need for brighter skin， many products have been developed to brighten the skin. Hydroquinone is the gold standard for skin lightening agents but the safety concerns on the use of hydroquinone/ are associated with some side effects such as exogenous ochronosis， pigmentation of the eyes and nails， and in some cases corneal damage.  This encourages researchers to find other agents for hyperpigmentation.\n\n【2】The introduction of tranexamic acid as skin lightening is a relatively new concept. Tranexamic acid inhibits melanin synthesis in melanocytes by interfering with the interactions of melanocytes and keratinocytes through inhibition of the plasminogen / plasmin system， which decreases the activ-ity of tyrosinase and leads to decreased melanin synthesis by melanocytes.  The results of some studies showed that the application of single topical tranexamic acid 3% has successfully decreased the MASI score in melasma patients.  The previ-ous study of tranexamic acid produced conflicting data when it was compared to hydroquinone. In this study， we used tranex-amic acid with a combination of several other depigmentation agents to produce better skin lightening products.\n\n【3】Combined materials with different targeting mechanisms are used to enhance the effectiveness of the lighting agent. Skin pigmentation regulation occurs at various levels， and different interferences are required. The combination approach is thought to be more successful than simply targeting tyrosinase.  Galac-tomyces ferment filtrate is known to reduce the appearance of skin pigmentation by reducing melanin synthesis and oxidative stress in melanocyte cells.  Niacinamide has been known to inhibit the transfer of melanosomes from melanocyte cells to keratinocytes.  Arbutin has a mechanism of action of melanosomal tyrosinase inhibition at non-toxic concentrations. We want to use these agents in combination with a tranex-amic acid to produce an effective lightening agent. Thus，this study aims to evaluate the skin lightening effect of the com-bination of tranexamic acid 3%， galactomyces ferment filtrate2%， niacinamide 4%，and alpha arbutin 2% compared to hydro-quinone 4%.\n\n【4】Methods\n\n【5】This double-blind，randomized controlled clinical trial was done at dermatovenereology clinic at Hasanuddin University Hospi-tal， Makassar， between April to May 2018. The subjects were explained the study and those who agreed were asked to sign an informed consent form (Ref. Number；215/H4.8.4.5.31/PP36-KOMETIK/ 2018 from Hasanuddin University Ethics Commit-tee). In total 30 subjects， aged from 25 to 50 years， with skin pho totypes Ⅲ to V according to Fitzpatrick's classification， were in-cluded in the study. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy/lactation，University. Address； JI. Perintis Kemerdekaan KM.11 Tamalanrea， Makassar， Souththe presence of other dermatoses on the arm， history of hyper-sensitivity to a substance used in this study， use of any aesthetic medical procedures or depigmenting agents on the face within one month before the study， and use of systemic tranexamic acid within three months before the study.\n\n【6】All patients enrolled in the study were instructed not to apply any other product on their arms beside the agents used in this study. Subjects in the experimental group received a topical serum formulation containing a combination of tranexamic acid(containing tranexamic acid 3%， galactomyces ferment filtrate4%， niacinamide 2% and alpha arbutin 4%) and hydroquinone4% as a control. Serum combination of tranexamic acid and hydroquinone were placed in two identical containers coded as A and B. To ensure the serum was applied to the same site； a special patron was made. The patron was made of elastic material with two holes， with the distance of the first hole (A) located 4 cm from cubital fossa， and the second hole (B) located4 cm from the first hole. The patron was then placed on the outer side of the left forearm. Serum A was then applied on the first hole (A)， and serum B applied to the second hole (B). In the morning and evening， each subject applied one drop of each serum to the applying site. The subject then evaluated each week for four weeks.\n\n【7】Standardized photographs were taken at a fixed position and a fixed distance from the applying site. Skin pigmentation and erythema were measured using a chromameter (CR-400， Mi-nolta， Japan). The chromameter provides 3 variables L\\*， a\\*， and b\\*， brightness ranging from 0 (black) to 100 (white)， a\\* (degree of redness)， and b\\* (variation in color between blue and where lower values indicate a darker skin and higher values a lighter skin). All measurements were taken three times， and the mean value was used. Standardized photographs， chromameter mea-surement and adverse effects (AEs) were assessed at baseline and during each visit.\n\n【8】Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 22. To assess the difference in skin brightness and pigmentation intensity between the two serum groups， an Independent T-test was used. Change in scores based on measurement time in each serum group was measured using Pearson’s Correlation was used. The test results are significant if the value of p <0.05.\n\n【9】Results\n\n【10】All 30 subjects completed the study in four weeks. No subjects discontinued their participation due to lack of effectiveness or adverse events. The mean L\\* value， as measured by chromame-ter at baseline (T0) and each follow-up per week (T7，T14，T21， T28)， were shown in Table 1.\n\n【11】At baseline， the mean value of L\\* on the area applied with combination serum of 3% tranexamic acid at baseline was 56，81， whereas in the area applied with 4% hydroquinone was 55，66. In the final follow-up， the mean value of L\\* on the area applied with combination serum of 3% tranexamic acid was 58，34 and the area applied with hydroquinone 4% serum was 5748. Based on these data， there was a significant increase of mean L\\* value at both sites applied with serum combination of tranexamic acid3%(p<0.05) and at the area applied with 4% hydroquinone(p<0.01) from baseline to final follow-up timepoint at week 4 . There was not any significant difference in the means of L\\*value between the tranexamic acid and hydroquinone area at allvisits and at the end of follow-up.\n\n【12】In table 3， there was a significant decrease in a\\* score in both groups (p<0.05).

There was no significant change of b\\* score parameter in both groups (p> 0.05).\n\n【20】There were no side effects in both products， and the subjects in this study well tolerated them.\n\n【21】Discussion\n\n【22】There is a high demand for safe and effective skin depigmenta-tion agents. The previously accepted gold standard skin depig-mentation agent， hydroquinone， has some frequently reported adverse events. Because of this potential health risk， in 2001hydroquinone was banned from the use of cosmetic products thereby encouraging the effort to find new depigmentation agents. Among them， it is generally recognised that arbutin， ascorbic acid， azelaic acid， kojic acid， licorice， niacinamide， andgalactomises ferment filtrate have skin depigmentation proper-ties. However， much research has been done still at the in vitro level for most of these agents， and there is still no controlled clinical trial data. \n\n【23】In Table 1 there was an increase in skin brightness from week1 (T7) to week 4 (T28) in both groups receiving serum combi-nation of 3% tranexamic acid and 4% hydroquinone serum. In this study， the group receiving a combination of 3% tranexamic acid showed a higher skin brightness score on T7，T14， T21 and T28 compared to the 4% hydroquinone group， although this difference is not statistically significant (p>0.05). This data sug-gested that tranexamic acid combination serum is as effective as hydroquinone in promoting skin depigmentation. This finding is consistent with previous studies showing the effectiveness of topical tranexamic acid as a depigmentation agent in melasma therapy where MASI score was reduced with no side effects observed. An in-vitro study of human melanocyte cells given galactomyces ferment filtrate 5% every two days showed 35% melanin decrease in 25 days.  Studies on niaci-namide have demonstrated melanosomal transfer suppression resulting in decreased skin pigmentation and 4% niacinamide is an effective agent for the treatment of melasma.  In a study conducted by Lee et al. there was a reduction of facial hyperpigmentation after combination therapy of tranexamic acid and niacinamide.  A study showed that applying 2%alpha-arbutin for one month was effective in brightening the skin\n\n【24】Table 2 showed that there was a significant increase in skin brightness in both areas applied with tranexamic acid 3% serum(p <0.05) and in the area applied with hydroquinone 4% serum(p<0.01). The results of this study are by the research conducted by Banihashemi et al. over 12 weeks compared the MASI score reduction more in the group applied with 5% tranexamic acid cream compared to the group applied with hydroquinone 4%cream， although not statistically significant.  Research by Afeti et al. which compared topical tranexamic acid 5% with hydroquinone 2% in melasma treatment also resulted in a similar12-week MASI score reduction by both groups. \n\n【25】In table 3， there was a significant decrease in a\\* score in both groups (p <0.05). The degree of the decreased score was higher in tranexamic acid than Hydroquinone，i.e. 0.314 compared to0.221. Previous reports have also shown that tranexamic acid reduces erythema in melasma skin， as it is associated with a decrease in the number of blood vessels in the dermis. The anti-angiogenic or anti-inflammatory effects of tranexamic acid have been reported.  Research by Kim et al. indicating a topical tranexamic acid application was found a consistent a\\* decrease in the chromameter examination. \n\n【26】Conclusion\n\n【27】Serum combination of tranexamic acid 3%， galactomyces fer-ment filtrate 2%， niacinamide 4% and alpha arbutin 2% can be considered as a safe and effective option to increase skin bright-ness with no significant side effect.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It has distinct features， the most important of which is short tubular bones and short ribs with platyspondyly， al-lowing a precise radiologic and prenatal ultrasonographic diagnosis. It has been reported to be caused by mutations in the FGFR3 gene， but exactly how cytogenetic abnormalities might lead to TD is unclear.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】We report a case of TD with different prenatal sonographic features compatible with the classifica-tion of type I. In the result of cytogenetic examination， we found de novo CAs in 28% of cells ana-lyzed from the affected infant； 75% of the abnormalities were numerical， and of those， 25% were structural aberrations； 21% of cells revealed predominantly numerical aberrations. Monosomy 18，21 and 22 was observed in 4% of cells， monosomy 20 in 2%， and monosomy 7， 8， 14， 17 and 19 in1%. Structural changes were observed in 7% of cells. Conclusions： It appears that these chromo-somes may be preferentially involved in and important for TD development.\n\n【4】key words： thanatophoric dysplasia·typel· chromosomal aberrations · monosomy\n\n【5】BACKGROUND\n\n【6】TD was first described in 1967 by Maroteaux et al. It is one of the most common forms of platyspondylic lethal skel-etal dysplasias， and is a sporadic neonatal chondrodysplasia causing severe shortening of the limbs with macrocephaly， narrow thorax and short ribs.TD is inherited in an autoso-mal dominant manner； the majority of probands have a de nouo mutation. The 2 clinical subtypes have been recently ascribed to mutations in the fibroblast growth factor recep-tor 3 (FGFR3) gene  which also accounts for achondro-plasia  and hypochondroplasia . TD type I (TD1) is characterized by short limbs， a narrow thoracic cage and curved femora， with or without a cloverleaf skull； whereas TD type II (TD2) is characterized by short limbs， a narrow thoracic cage， straight femora and a cloverleaf skull . Although lethal TDl and TD2 cases are sporadic， in an epidemiological analysis TD was associated with increased paternal age and achondroplasia ， suggesting that TD may be caused by autosomal dominant mutations. This was further confirmed by molecular genetics studies. But， ex-actly how cytogenetic findings might lead to TD is unclear， and there was no evidence of linkage to the cytogenetics in the patients affected with TD. Cytogenetic an alysis is an important step in understanding the genetic background of TD， and may provide a valuable clue to the identifica-tion of target loci and aid in the successful search for ma-jor genes. Here， we report the first case of TD in which an apparent de novo cytogenetic fin ding was present in the af-fected infant. This case is the first report of a TD type I con-firmed by both clinical and cytogenetic findings in Turkey.\n\n【7】CASE REPORT\n\n【8】The patient was born by caesarean section at the gestation-al age of 38 weeks in the obstetrics and gynecology clinic of Adana Numune Training and Research Hospital，Adana， Turkey. The patient was the fifth living baby from the fifth gestation of the mother. The patient's father was 40 vears old and the mother was 32 years old； they were second de-gree consanguineous. It was learned that there was no fol-low-up of the mother during pregnancy. Other siblings were healthy. Apgar score at the first minute was 1. The new-born infant was resuscitated for post-natal respiratory dis-tress， cyanosis and bradycardia. Post-resuscitation fifth min-ute Apgar score was 3. The newborn infant was intubated because of the absence of adequate spontaneous respira-tion. We detected that temperature was 36°C， heart pulse was 100 beats per minute， birth weight was 2900 gr，length was 42 cm and head circumference was 37 cm. Other phys-ical examination findings of the newborn infant were a large cranium， a large anterior fontanel， a depressed na-sal bridge and a small face. The baby was relatively macro-cephalic. We detected atypical facial findings of the new-born infant  -low-set ears， flat face， short neck and small mouth. The frontal and mandibular protrusions were evident. The lower and upper extremities were short and the thorax was narrow. There were coarse crackles in the lungs. Heart rhythm was tachycardic. There was no or-ganomegaly. No additional sounds and no murmur were heard. Newborn reflexes were absent. According to the first examination， we thought that the patient had achondropla-sia， but we were decided on thanatophoric dysplasia due to the narrowness of the patient's rib cage.\n\n【9】Skeletal radiography showed the presence of medial ace-tabula spurs， hypoplastic iliac bones， bowed femora with rounded protrusion of the proximal femur hypoplastic thorax and wafer-thin vertebral bodies . Our case was diagnosed as type l thanatophoric dysplasia be-cause of the bowed and short femur， whereas patients with type 2 thanatophoric dysplasia have longer and flatter fe-murs. Ultrasonographic views of the abdomen and crani-um were performed to search for additional anomalies， but these were normal. We found no pathology in routine blood tests and biochemical analysis. The newborn infant was placed in a mechanical ventilator and died after 33 days of hospitalization.\n\n【10】Cytogenetic analysis\n\n【11】Peripheral blood was taken from the subject (patient) for culture studies. Each sample was examined for cytogenetic anomalies in our genetics laboratory of the Department of Medical Biology， Faculty of Medicine， Cukurova University， Adana， Turkey. A 0.3 ml sample of blood was incubated at37°C for 72 h in 2 media (RPMI-1640). Standard cytoge-netic techniques were used for harvesting and slide prep-aration . The slides were first stained only with Giemsa before the examination in order to avoid missing any gaps. For detailed analysis of the fragile sites， some slides were prepared by GTG banding， and 100 metaphas-es were scored. The classification of fragile sites was done according to the nomenclature established in human gene mapping HGM11.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n\n【13】We observed a significantly greater number of single-cell numerical aberrations in 100 cells . Chromosomal aberrations (numerical and structural abnormalities) (CAs) were found in 28 (28%) abnommal cells of 100 cells analyzed. A total of 18 cells revealed predominantly numerical aber-rations. Of the abnormalities， 75% were numerical aberra-tions， and only 25% were structural . Numerical aberrations consisted of aneuploidies (monosomies) in Var-ious chromosomes (20%). Monosomy 18x4， 20x2， 21x4，22x4，7，8，17， 14， 19， +p? and +mar were found to be the numerical abnormalities. Interestingly， monosomy 18， 21and 22 was observed the 4% in all cells； monosomy 20 in 2cells (2%)； and monosomy 7，8， 14， 17， 19， and trisomy+p? and +mar in l cell (1%). Structural changes were observed in 7% of 100 cells. Structural aberrations usually consisted of deletion， fragility and gaps in chromosomes 1，2， 9 and X in l cell. The gap(2q31) were observed in 4 cells (8%)， fra(Xq22)，del(q21-qter) and del(q13-qter) in l cell.\n\n【14】Skeletal dysplasias are a heterogeneous group ofconditions associated with abnormalities in size， shape and density of the skeleton . Most are heritable and many have elaborate patterns of genetic transmission. TD results from dominantnew mutations and is thought to have an incidence of ap-proximately l in 37，000 live births ， although many cli-nicians suspect that its true incidence is greater. In a typi-cally lethal disorder such as TD， it is necessary to provide appropriate and knowledgeable counseling where surviv-ability is unlikely but conceivable.\n\n【15】Table 1. Cytogenetics results of patient.\n\n| Karyotypes  |\n| --- |\n| 46，XX，gap(q31)(3/100)；46，XX，del(q21-qter) (1/100)；46，  |\n| XX，-19，+p?，del(q13)(1/100)；47，XX，+mar，fra(X)(q22)(1/100)；  |\n| 44，XX，-14，-22(1/100)；44，XX，-18，-21(1/100)；45，XX，-7(1/100)；  |\n| 45，XX，-8(1/100)；45，XX，-17(1/100)；45，XX，-18(2/100)；45，XX，  |\n| \\-20(2/100)；45，XX，-21(3/100)；45，XX，-22(3/100)；45，X(1/100)  |\n\n【17】Wilcox et al.  described phenotypic variability among patients of TD with the same mutation in FGFR3 and sug-gested that the variable presence of radiological and histo-logical findings in each TD might be due to genetic， envi-ronmental and stochastic factors， but we have not perfomed direct sequencing analysis of the FGFR3 gene. The identi-fication of CAs may provide important leads in the search for the chromosomal location of major genes influencing TD. We report the first case ofTD in which an apparent de novo CAs was present in 28% of cells analyzed of the affect-ed infant； 21% of cells revealed predominantly numerical aberrations. Numerical aberrations consisted of aneuploi-dies in various chromosomes (monosomy 18，20，21，22，7，8，17，14， 19， and trisomy +p?， +mar). Interestingly， monosomy18， 21 and 22 was observed in approximately 20% of cells. Structural changes were observed in 7% of cells. This case could have been diagnosed as an unclassifiable TD (like skel-etal dysplasia) if chromosome analysis were not performed.\n\n【18】An increased risk for mental retardation and congenital anom-alies is known to be directly related to the presence of a de novo unbalanced structural rearrangement. Aneuploidy re-fers to losses and/or gains of individual chromosomes from the normal chromosome set. The resulting gene dosage im-balance has a noticeable effect on the phenotype.Autosomal monosomies are lethal and usually not compatible with nor-mal extra-uterine life. At the same time， the chromosome loss might be a hallmark of existing disease， even subclinically， but aberrations of the other chromosomes could be more important in the progression of the disease. The crucial role of chromosomal imbalance in abnormal early human devel-opment is well established. Approximately， 50-60% of first-trimester spontaneous abortions have karyotype abnomali-ties-mainly numerical chromosomal changes. In the present study， we reported the monosomy of chromosomes 18，2l and22 as the most frequent genetic alterations in the affected in-fant， occurring in approximately 20% of cells， but it has not been previously reported that these monosomies contribut-ed to the pathogenesis of TD. It appears that together these monosomies may be preferentially involved and important for our case. Undoubtedly， further studies are necessary to understand the role of these chromosome changes in TD.\n\n【19】In the present study， monesomy 18 is the most commor cytogenetic abnormality in the affected infant. Monosomy18p refers to a chromosomal disorder resulting from the absence of all or part of the short arm of chromosome 18. It was reported in 1963 by the French geneticist Jean de Grouchy  and was the first example of a partial mono-somy compatible with life. The incidence is estimated to be about 1： 50，000 of live-born infants. In the commonest form of the disorder， the dysmorphic syndrome is very moderate and non-specific. Clinical features typically include mild-to-moderate mental retardation， short stature， round face with short protruding philtrum， palpebral ptosis and large ears with detached pinnae. Various skeletal deformities such as scoliosis and/or kyphosis， coxa vara， dislocation of the hip and feet deformities have been reported. In males， genital hypoplasia with small penis and cryptorchidism is accasion-ally observed. Cardiac malformations appeared to be rela-tively uncommon， observed in about 10% of patients， with situs abnormalities in some cases . Various other mal-formations have been rarely or accasionally reported， of-ten for deletion 18p secondary to an unbalanced translo-cation with a concomitant partial trisomy.\n\n【20】Many autosomal monosomies are presumed to end in ar-rested growth in the first few mitoses， prior even to the time of implantation， with possibly some proceeding to the stage of occult abortion. The single exception may be monoso-my 21， although this has been questioned， with most earli-er reports of monosomy 21 recently re-interpreted as being due to an unbalanced translocation involving chromosome21. A fetus with the combination ofTD and monosomy 21has not been reported previeusly. Monosomy 21 mosaicism or full monosomy 21 is another very uncommon chromo-somal abnormality in live-born infants. Only 5 patients have been described， of which 2 were mosaic .On the other hand， a fetus with the combination of TD and triso-my 21 has recently been reported ， and there have been5 cases reported with both trisomy 21 and achondroplasia. Chen et al.  reported craniofacial features typ-ical of Down syndrome， but had skeletal findings character-istic of achondroplasia. Likewise， the fetus described here exhibited the craniofacial gestalt consistent with trisomy21， including a flat facial profile with low placement of de-formed small ears， epicanthic folds， and blepharaphimosis， as well as loose folds on the posterior neck. Macrocephaly was observed as in TD， while frontal bossing was absent， as in trisomy 21. The short nose with depressed nasal bridge and midface hypoplasia in the present fetus are manifesta-tions seen in both TD and trisomy 21. The body proportion and radiological findings in the present fetus were charac-teristic of TD. We have reported here an unusual case of TD associated with monosomy 21 mosaicism (4%). The same dysmorphic facial features and the multiple malformations in our case remarkably resemble cases of monosomy 21 de-scribed in the literature. As exemplified in this report， the possibility of concurrence of common disorders should al-ways be considered.\n\n【21】Chromosome 22 contains a considerable number of un-characterized disease genes (eg，familial schizophrenia sus-ceptibility， glioblastoma and other types of astrocytoma， ependymoma， meningioma， schwannomatosis， pheochro-mocytoma， breast and colon cancer) . In particular， imbalances of chromosomes that are recurrently involved in familial transmission from a normal mother to affected children will pose specific problems for genetic counselling，as illustrated by the monosomy 22. Here， we also often ob-served the monosomy 22 mosaicism (4%) in the infant. Monosomy of a chromosome 22 compatible with surviv-al occurs rarely and there have been more than 100 cases with partial monosomy 22q . Features reported in the literature include： significant delay in motor and men-tal development， hypotonia， large ears/low set ears， hyper-extensible joints， cutaneous syndactyly， short neck， failure to thrive， epicanthal folds， hypertelorism， flat nasal bridge， club foot， hip dysplasia， cardiac anomalies， humoral immu-nodeficiency and gastroschisis. Saugier-Veber et al.  de-tected a 22ql1 deletion in a patient with moderate MR，obe-sity， and facial dysmorphism. A significant delay in motor and mental development was observed by almost all. These suggest that our case had loss of chromosomes 21 and 22； this unstable chromosome is considered to have important candidate loci for TD.\n\n【22】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【23】The CAs in our patient is the first described in TD. There is a potential association between autosomal monosomies and TD phenotype in our case. It seems that monosomy 18，21and 22 mosaicisms are particularly likely to hold keys to the understanding of TD pathogenesis， and are also interest-ing candidates in the search for the gene loci of TD. These findings， therefore， may represent the initial step in iden-tifying the gene responsible for this condition， and provid-ing information to determine whether TD type l is geneti-cally distinct entities， with overlapping features", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

An extensive literature search did not reveal many re-ports of melioidosis in association with leprosy.\n\n【1】Case Report：\n\n【2】A 22-year-old woman， who was diagnosed with multibacillary leprosy， developed dapsone-induced methemo-globinemia and hemolytic anemia， complicated by melioidosis. Methemoglobinemia was treated with meth-ylene blue and vitamin C. Two weeks of ceftazidime was initiated to treat melioidosis， and the patient was discharged on amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and doxycycline as melioidosis eradication therapy. However， she de-veloped drug-induced hypersensitivity. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole， as an alternative treatment for mel-ioidosis eradication， was commenced and was successfully completed for 12 weeks. During the fifth month of multidrug therapy， the patient developed type Il lepra reaction with erythema nodosum leprosum reaction， which was treated with prednisolone. Leprosy treatment continued with clofazimine and ofloxacin， and com-plete resolution of skin lesions occurred after 12 months of therapy\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】Our case highlighted the challenges posed in managing a patient with multibacillary leprosy with multiple com-plications. Clinicians should be aware that dapsone-induced methemoglobinemia and hemolysis might com-plicate the treatment of leprosy. Our case also highlighted the safety and efficacy of combining ofloxacin and clofazimine as a leprosy treatment regimen in addition to gradual steroid dose titration in the presence of type Il lepra reaction.\n\n【5】Keywords： Dapsone · Leprosy· Melioidosis· Methemoglobinemia\n\n【6】Leprosy is an infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae， while melioidosis results from the gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. An extensive literature search did not reveal many reports of melioidosis in association with lep-rosy. We present a case of a lepromatous leprosy co-infected with melioidosis， complicated by dapsone-induced methemo-globinemia and type 2 lepra reaction.\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】A 22-year-old woman， who was previously healthy，presented with multiple copper-colored macules and patches that showed loss of sensation to pinprick and light touch， dryness，and loss of hair. Physical examination revealed loss of eyebrows and a palpable thickened ulnar nerve without muscle weakness or atrophy. No leonine facies were identified. With leprosy as part of the differential diagnosis， slit skin smear was performed from both earlobes and 6 distinct active sites. A diagnosis of multibacillary leprosy was confirmed with a morphological in-dex of 2.0% and bacteriological index of 3.3.\n\n【9】Further investigations showed normal values for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity， complete blood count， and renal and liver biochemistry. The patient was seronegative for HIV， syphilis， and hepatitis B and C. Sputum acid-fast bacil-li smears were negative， with no tuberculosis or active infec-tive lung features on chest X-ray. The patient was commenced on standard multidrug therapy (MDT) comprising clofazimine(300 mg once a month and 50 mg daily)， rifampicin (600 mg once a month)， and dapsone (100 mg daily).\n\n【10】On day 26 after medication commencement， the patient was ad-mitted for dyspnea and high-grade fever with chills. She denied intake of traditional medications or over-the-counter drugs. On examination， she appeared tachypneic and tachycardic. Oxygen saturation (SpO，) under room air measured by pulse oximeter varied between 75% and 78%， and it did not increase after ap-plication of a non-rebreathing mask with 15 L/min oxygen. She appeared pale， jaundiced， and cyanotic. Radial arterial and ve-nous blood was dark colored. Arterial blood gas under room air showed partial pressure of O， of 125 mmHg and partial pres-sure of CO， of 88 mmHg. The clinical features were consistent with methemoglobinemia. Due to the resource-restricted set-ting， the methemoglobin concentration was unavailable.\n\n【11】There was laboratory evidence of severe hemolysis， with he-moglobin of 5.4 g/dL (a drop of 6 g/dL compared with base-line)， reticulocyte count of 4.1%， lactate dehydrogenase of 1512U/L， and predominantly indirect hyperbilirubinemia. A periph-eral blood smear was consistent with features of hemolysiswith spherocytes. Coombs test was negative. Due to the he-modynamically significant anemia， 1 pint of packed cell trans-fusion， intravenous (i.v.) hydrocortisone 100 mg 3 times dai-ly， and folic acid were given.\n\n【12】Due to the clinical evidence of sepsis， thorough infective screening， including mycoplasma serology， blood film malaria parasite， and sputum and blood cultures， was conducted. The results were negative. The melioidosis enzyme-linked immu-nosorbent assay (ELISA) immunoglobulin (Ig)M antibody titer was 1： 640 (reference value ≤1：320). Abdominal ultrasonog-raphy showed multiple splenic micro-abscesses. Melioidosis infection was confirmed and treated with i.v. ceftazidime (2g every 8 h) for 2 weeks as part of an intensive regimen， fol-lowed by amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (1250 mg 3 times daily) and doxycycline (100 mg twice daily) as eradication therapy.\n\n【13】Dapsone-induced methemoglobinemia and hemolytic anemia complicated by melioidosis infection were suspected due to the oxygen-resistant cyanosis without respiratory compromise or abnormalities on chest X-ray and the presence of severe he-molysis. Thus， the patient's MDT was withheld. She was start-ed on methylene blue in addition to hyperhydration， forced al-kaline diuresis， and parentrovite，which contained 1000 mg of ascorbic acid. The hemolysis resolved with a gradual increment in SpO， level a few days after treatment began.\n\n【14】A few days later， the patient developed drug-induced hyper-sensitivity， manifesting as pruritic， erythrodermic-like skin rashes with an absence of angioedema and urticarial lesions. Antibiotics were then withheld until complete res-olution of skin lesions. Topical emollient and steroid treatment were prescribed in addition to antihistamine. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) desensitization， as an alternative for the melioidosis eradication regimen， was started success-fully and completed over a total of 12 weeks. Repeated serum melioidosis ELISA results were negative with complete resolu-tion of splenic micro-abscesses.\n\n【15】However， after 4 weeks of full-dose Bactrim treatment and 5months of MDT， the patient developed erythematous nodular skin lesions over her face and bilateral upper and lower limbs. Type Il lepra reaction was suspected， and pred-nisolone 0.5 mg/kg/d was started. A skin biopsy was consis-tent with lepromatous leprosy with erythema nodosum lepro-sum reaction . Symptoms improved with steroid therapy， and anti-leprosy treatment continued with clofazimine and ofloxacin (400 mg daily). Rifampicin was withheld because we were concerned about treatment monitoring and possible risk of hypersensitivity reaction to rifampicin in this patient. Steroid treatment was tapered off over a 6-month period. The patient was well， with complete resolution of skin lesions af-ter 12 months of leprosy treatment.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Methemoglobinemia is often difficult to diagnose and poses a great clinical challenge. Methemoglobin is an aberrant form of hemoglobin arising from oxidation of heme iron to the fer-ric (Fe\\*+) form， resulting in a left shift in the oxygen saturation curve . Hemolytic anemia may follow drug-induced methe-moglobinemia， especially with exposure to dapsone and sul-fonamides . Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion and be able to recognize methemoglobinemia as an adverse effect attributable to dapsone use，particularly when patients present with cyanosis and hypoxemia of unclear etiology and there is a saturation gap (ie， a difference between oxygen sat-uration measured by pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas analysis) . Our patient demonstrated oxygen-resistant cya-nosis with a saturation gap of 37%.\n\n【18】Mild methemoglobinemia can be managed with supportive care and cessation of the offending drug， whereas methylene blue and vitamin C are indicated for moderate to severe forms. Methylene blue is reduced to leukomethylene blue， which acts as an artificial electron donor to methemoglobin， thereby en-hancing the ability of erythrocytes to reduce methemoglobin. Vitamin C has antioxidant effects on hemoglobin to prevent conversion to methemoglobin . Our patient responded well to methylene blue and vitamin C， as evidenced by the in-crement in oxygen saturation as well as complete resolution of methemoglobinemia and hemolysis.\n\n【19】It has been reported that methemoglobin levels are significantly higher in patients with sepsis because large amounts of nitric oxide， which is converted to methemoglobin and nitrate， are released in this group of patients . This might explain the severe clinical phenotype in our case in which a concomitant melioidosis infection was present. Thus， a targeted therapy in sepsis is warranted to hasten the clinical recovery. Hemolyticanemia is a serious adverse effect of therapeutic drugs result-ing from increased destruction of drug-damaged erythrocytes by macrophages in the spleen and liver .\n\n【20】Melioidosis is prevalent in Southeast Asia due to agricultural exposure. Patients have clinical evidence of sepsis with high-grade fever and chills， high titer of melioidosis ELISA IgM an-tibody (1： 640， reference value ≤1： 320)， and multiple splenic micro-abscesses on abdominal ultrasonography， all of which suggested melioidosis in our patient. Melioidosis treatment consists of i.v. intensive phase and oral eradication phase. Ceftazidime and meropenem are recommended for the former， while trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is the first-line drug for the latter phase . The rationale for choosing amoxicillin/cla-vulanic acid and doxycycline as the preferred eradication reg-imen for melioidosis treatment is due to trimethoprim/sulfa-methoxazole， which contains sulfonamides， being known to cause methemoglobinemia similar to dapsone . Due to hy-persensitivity reaction to the former antibiotics， we decided to try trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole using the desensitiza-tion protocol， which was successful. Our patient was able to finish a 12-week treatment with complete eradication of mel-ioidosis， as evidenced by negative IgM ELISA titer and resolu-tion of splenic micro-abscesses.\n\n【21】Our patient initially received standard treatment regimen for multibacillary leprosy (rifampicin， dapsone， and clofazimine MDT)； however， she developed dapsone-induced methemo-globinemia and hemolysis. She also developed a hypersensi-tivity reaction to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and doxycycline， which are penicillin and tetracycline antibiotics， respectively. Various studies have reported that patients with a penicillin allergy might exhibit an allergic response to tetracycline ， thus minocycline might not be a feasible alternative for leprosy treatment. In contrast， ofloxacin， which displays powerful bac-tericidal activity against M. leprae， is the most widely acceptedfluoroquinolone for treatment of leprosy . A combination of ofloxacin and other agents may considerably shorten the req uired duration of MDT . Our patient showed remarkable clinical improvement， with attainment of good quality of life.\n\n【22】Conclusions\n\n【23】Our case highlighted the challenges posed in managing a pa-tient with multibacillary leprosy with multiple complications. Clinicians should be aware that dapsone-induced methemo-globinemia and hemolysis might complicate the treatment of leprosy. Our case also highlighted the safety and efficacy of combining ofloxacin and clofazimine as a leprosy treatment regimen in addition to gradual steroid dose titration in the presence of type ll lepra reaction.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Preoperative internal iliac artery balloon occlusion (IIABO) has been widely performed to min-imize blood loss during cesarean hysterectomy for an abnormal attachment of the placenta. Our case is the first reported case of common iliac artery balloon occlusion (CIABO) being more effective than lIABO for reduc-ing blood loss during a cesarean hysterectomy in the same patient.\n\n【1】Case Report： We performed cesarean hysterectomy with IIABO in a 36-year-old Japanese female who had placenta percre-ta. However， there was still a large amount of blood loss. We immediately changed the balloon from the inter-nal iliac artery to the common iliac artery， which visibly reduced the amount of blood loss. We finally achieved cesarean hysterectomy.\n\n【2】Conclusions： CIABO was found to be more effective than lIABO for reducing blood loss during cesarean hysterectomy.

The most severe form of abnormal attachment of the placenta is placenta percreta， which indicates that the placenta has pen-etrated the entire uterine wall. The generally accepted treat-ment for placenta percreta is cesarean hysterectomy without attempts to detach the placenta. Preoperative internal iliac ar-tery balloon occlusion (IIABO) has been widely performed to reduce the blood loss during cesarean hysterectomy to treat an abnormal attachment of the placenta .\n\n【4】We experienced a case in which we were unable to reduce the blood loss during cesarean hysterectomy in any way using pre-operative IIABO. We immediately transferred the balloon from the internal iliac artery to the common iliac artery， which vis-ibly reduced the amount of blood loss.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】A 36-year-old， gravida 8， para 4， Japanese female， visited our hospital for amenorrhea and was found to be pregnant， at an estimated 16 weeks of gestation. The patient had undergone four previous cesarean sections. The first cesarean section was performed due to genital herpes， and the three subsequent surgeries were repeated cesarean sections. The patient had also undergone four artificial abortion. She had a history of smoking 10 cigarettes a day for 20 years. We diagnosed her current pregnancy as complete placenta previa at 23 weeks of gestation.Ultrasonography revealed the loss of the hhyp Oic retroplacental zone， and the presence of multiple irregular pla-cental lacunae (multiple dilated blood vessels) and increased vessels throughout the placenta. Cystoscopy revealed no in-filtration of the placenta into the tunica mucosa vesicae uri-nariae. We diagnosed the pregnancy as placenta increta at 28weeks of gestation. Elective cesarean hysterectomy with IIABO was planned to be performed at 35 weeks of gestation. We in-formed the patient and her family of all of the risks involved in the surgery. Prior to the surgery， bilateral uretera. stent-cathe-ters were inserted by an urologist at our hospital. Preoperative occlusion balloons were placed in the bilateral internal iliac arteries by a radiologist at our hospital.Under general anes-thesia， a transverse incision of the uterine fundus was made. A male baby was born with an Apgar score of 4/9 points， and weighed 2668g. The balloons in the bilateral internal iliac ar-teries were then inflated. We then sutured the uterine wound without detaching the placenta. When we started to perform the hysterectomy， a large amount of blood suddenly gushed in torrents from the vagina. We were unable control the bleed-ing with IIABO. A radiologist immediately deflated the two bal-loons in the internal iliac arteries. He transferred them to thebilateral common iliac arteries and inflated them. Following this， the bleeding decreased significantly. The transfer from IIABO to CIABO took 30 minutes， during which time， the amount of blood loss measured 5，910 m! . The hysterectomy was performed with a total blood loss of 7，720 ml. The bilat-eral common iliac arteries were occluded for a total of 62 min-utes. The patient was transfused with a total of 1，200 ml of autologous blood， 10 units of packed red cell concentrate， and10 units of packed fresh frozen plasma. The serum potassium level was 3.9 (3.5-4.8 mEq/l) after 120 min of CIABO. Severe acidosis was not observed. The placenta had completely pen-etrated the left side of the uterine wall and we diagnosed the pregnancy as placenta percreta . The patient's post-operative course was uneventful. She was discharged from our hospital on the eighth postoperative day without any compli-cations. Six months after the operation， both she and her in-fant remained healthy.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】The options to treat abnormal attachment of the placenta (pla-centa accreta， placenta increta and placenta percreta) include both conservative and extirpative approaches. The extirpative approach usually requires an adjuvant hemostatic technique， such as bilateral internal iliac artery ligation or preoperativeplacement of balloon occlusion at the upper reaches of the ar-tery. Carnevale et al. described 21 cases of lIABO used to treat patients with placenta accreta who underwent cesarean hys-terectomy， and concluded that this technique is safe and ef-fectively reduces blood loss. Some reports have reached sim-ilar conclusions . In our case， we attempted to perform IIABO； however， massive vaginal bleeding suddenly occurred due to detachment of the placenta as a result uterine contrac-tions. A quick exchange from lIABO to CIABO was very effec-tive for reducing the amount of blood loss. This indicates that the patient's internal iliac artery likely had extensive anasto-moses. Failure of IIABO can be explained by the presence of extensive anastomoses in the pelvic vasculature. Some reports have concluded that the use of llABO in patients did not im-prove surgical outcomes compared with patients without the treatment . Shih et al. have insisted that the obturator ar-tery serves as an important anastomosis bridging the internal and external iliac arteries .Angiographic studies of patients undergoing IIA ligation have also identified the branches of the lumbar， sacral， rectal， femoral， and even internal thoracic arteries as the origins of collateral circulation.\n\n【9】Shih et al. were the first to report a successful case of CIABO during cesarean hysterectomy to treat placenta percreta. CIABO occludes more central arteries than lIABO， and is considered to have stronger hemostatic properties. Additionally， CIABO is an easier method with regard to inserting the catheter than IIABO. However， prolonged occlusion of the common iliac ar-teries may be associated with reperfusion injury， thrombo-sis， and the formation of embolisms in the lower extremities. Surgery to treat abdominal aortic aneurysms requires at least one hour of aortic cross clamping， and patient can successful-ly undergo abdominal aortic aneurysm repair； therefore，the amount of time to safely perform CIABO is thought to be one hour or less. However， pregnancy is a relatively hypercoagu-lable state. Therefore， the occlusion time should be as short as possible. Only one case report has so far been published about thrombosis in CIABO\n\n【10】There are also very few reports of the use of CIABO. Additionally， there have been no randomized controlled studies comparing the amount of intraoperative blood loss occurring with IIABO and CIABO. Our case is the first reported case of CIABO being more effective than lIABO for reducing blood loss during a ce-sarean hysterectomy in the same patient. Further evaluations of the efficacy and outcomes of CIABO are needed in order to select alternative techniques to use when performing cesar-ean hysterectomies.\n\n【11】Conclusions\n\n【12】CIABO was found to be more effective than IIABO for reduc-ing blood loss during cesarean hysterectomy. Failure of IIABO can be explained by the presence of extensive anastomoses in the pelvic vasculature.\n\n【13】Declaration of competing interests\n\n【14】We declare that we have no competing interests.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

This patient had previously undergone pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) for the management of blunt ocular trauma in the same eye. He was being treated with topical antihypertensives， due to silicone oil-induced glaucoma. On presentation， the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in his right eye was 20/40 and the intraocular pressure (IOP) in the same eye was 20 mmHg. Slit lamp examination of his right eye showed apha-kia， aniridia， and some silicone oil droplets (fish eggs) following silicone oil extraction. His corneal endotheli-um and thickness were within normal limits. Dilated fundoscopic examination of the right eye revealed that the retina was attached with no signs of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). An artificial iris intraocular lens(IOL) was implanted， along with 4-point scleral fixation in conjunction with Gore-Tex sutures. After 6 months， the BCVA in his right eye was 20/40 and he had no symptoms of photophobia. The IOP in that eye was 15mmHg while on treatment with dorzolamide-timolol eye drops. No suture-related or other serious complica-tions were observed. The patient expressed satisfaction with the functional and cosmetic results.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】Modern vitrectomy combined with an artificial iris IOL and scleral fixation with Gore-Tex sutures in eyes lacking an iris and lens can provide long-term anatomic and functional restoration. Intraoperative IOP fluctuations and extra corneal damage can be avoided by lens preparation with the sutures using a small incision ab-externo approach.\n\n【5】MeSH Keywords： Aniridia· Aphakia · Lenses， Intraocular· Polytetrafluoroethylene·VitrectomyBlunt ocular trauma can result in serious complications， such as vitreous hemorrhage， retinal detachment， lens subluxation， and iris defects . After primary intervention with pars pla na vitrectomy (PPV)， it is important to address the function-al problems associated with aphakia and iris defects， such as photophobia， glare sensitivity， contrast sensitivity and de-creased visual acuity . The restoration or replacement of these structures is not always straightforward. Problems may be directly related to the trauma， such as sulcus absence or thin sclera， or to secondary pathology， such as glaucoma de-velopment or keratopathy . The use of silicone oil as a tamponade agent in eyes with retinal detachment can also cause silicone oil-induced glaucoma . Although various de-vices and techniques are available for the management of aphakia  and aniridia ， some of these are not always effective over the long-term . This report describes a safe and viable approach for the management of post-trau-matic aniridia and aphakia.\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】A 55-year-old man with a history of severe blunt ocular trau-ma in his right eye was referred to our clinic with symptoms of blurred vision and photophobia. This patient had undergone20G PPV with a silicone oil tamponade for repair of traumat-ic retinal detachment at another hospital， followed 3 months later by silicone oil extraction at the same hospital. His right eye had a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/40 and an intraocular pressure (IOP) of 20 mmHg with topical medi-cations， whereas his left eye had a BCVA of 20/25 and an IOP of 15 mmHg. Slit lamp examination of the right eye revealed aphakia， subtotal iris absence and silicone oil droplet accumu-lation (fish eggs). Corneal thickness was 590 um and the cor-neal endothelium was in good condition. Fundoscopy showed that his retina was attached with no signs of proliferative vit-reoretinopathy (PVR).\n\n【8】Implantation of the Ophtec (Ophtec USA， Inc.， Boca Raton， FL)311 artificial iris lens was regarded as the optimal treatment. IOL Master showed that the right eye of this patient had an axial length of 23.8 mm， a white-to-white distance of 11.4 mm， and an average K-value was 40.13/43.66 D. The required diop-tric power for the lens was determined to be +22.0 D. The sco-topic and photopic pupil diameters of the left eye were also measured. Based on the iris color of his left eye and the pa-tient's preference， a black lens body， equivalent to the artifi-cial iris area， was chosen. Based on all measurements， the size of the lens body was determined to be 9 mm and the size of the optic (equal to pupil size) was determined to be 3 mm.\n\n【9】A hybrid 25G/27G vitrectomy with the Alcon Constellation Sys-tem was considered optimal for this patient. Figure 1A pres-ents the eye at the beginning of the operation. The first step of the procedure was oil droplet removal. Because the retina was attached， with no indications of PVR development or any findings indicating a need for prophylactic laser treatment， the surgeons proceeded with lens management. For the lens fixation， Gore-Tex CV-8 sutures were chosen. Two 25G sclerot-omies were made nasally and temporally， each exactly 2 mm posterior to the limbus. Accuracy was maximized with a radi-al keratoplasty marker. The sutures were inserted via sclerot-omy into the temporal and nasal quadrants. Using the ‘hand-shake' technique ， each suture was externalized via the adjacent sclerotomy . This resulted in the forma-tion of 4 internal loops， 2 nasal and 2 temporal， with the su-ture ends external to the 4 sclerotomies . From a limbal incision at 12 o'clock， 2 loops， 1 from each side， were externalized . To avoid the risk of acute hypotony and extra corneal damage， the lens haptics with the suture loops was prepared ab externo. The loops were tied to the hap-tics (apex hole) with cow hitch knots . After tying the sutures onto the lens haptics was completed， the corne-al wound was enlarged to approximately 9 mm， and the lens was carefully inserted . The corneal wound was su-tured with 10.0 Prolene. The sutures were pulled from the sclerotomies， achieving lens centration. The adjacent pairs of suture ends， 2 from the temporal and 2 from the nasal side， were tied together and the knots were pushed inside the eye from the sclerotomy. Spare suture loops， which had not been tied to the lens， were removed. Finally， the conjunc-tiva were placed over the exposed sutures and sutured with8.0 Vicry! .\n\n【10】Six months after the operation， the patient's eye had a BCVA of 20/40 and an IOP of 20 mmHg， which was controlled with dorzolamide-timolol combination drops. Cornealthickness was610 um and endothelial cell density was 1680 cells/mm丫. Lens centration was ideal， and there was no lens tilt. The retina re-mained attached， with no evidence of cystoid macular edema. No suture-related reactions were observed， and the patient has not reported symptoms of glare and photophobia. The patient also expressed satisfaction with both the functional and cos-metic results .\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Aphakia and aniridia can be managed with relatively less in-vasive methods， such as contact lens use or corneal tattoo-ing . The present patient， however， could not toler-ate contact lens use and desired a more permanent solution. Patients who underwent IOL scleral fixation  and custom-ized silicone iris prosthesis (Dr Schmidt Intraocularlinsen GmbH，distributed by HumanOptics AG) have been described . In this patient， a complete solution with a single implant was preferred. The Ophtec 311 iris reconstruction lens is a lens made of a single piece of clear and colored ultraviolet light-absorbing polymethyl methacrylate. The opaque (colored) part of the lens is available in brown， blue， and green and has a biconvex configuration. The available refractive power ranges from +10.0 D to +30.0 D in 0.5 D increments， although lenses without refractive power (plano) are also available. Each lens has 2 haptics in a C-loop configuration， with a small hole lo-cated at the apex of each haptic .\n\n【13】Several methods have been described for scleral or iris fixation of IOLs ， but these methods have drawbacks， such as suture erosion or melting . This has led to the use of different techniques， such as scleral pockets with the lens haptics ， or stronger sutures made of materials such as Gore-Tex (W.L.\n\n【14】Gore & Associates， Elkton，MD， USA) ， especially in young-er patients. Gore-Tex sutures are non-absorbable， polytetraflu-oroethylene monofilaments with greater tensile strength for suturing lenses than the more commonly used Prolene sutures(polypropylene； Ethicon， Somerville， NJ， USA). Gore-Tex sutures are used for heart valve and vascular procedures ， but ophthalmologists use it off-label in oculoplastics and for IOL scleral fixation . Because our patient was relative-ly young， the use of Gore-Tex sutures seemed reasonable.\n\n【15】In most trauma cases， the integrity of the eyeball is compro-mised. Even after successful suturing of the ruptured struc-tures， the anatomy of the eyeball is not always fully restored. Asymmetry may be due to scar tissue formation and scleral thinning. In our patient， the size of the rupture was approxi-mately 5 mm， extending in an oblique direction posterior to the limbus. The conjunctiva was shrunken， the sclera wasthinned， and the eyeball symmetry was not optimal， resulting in considerations about the possibility of lens centration or tilting. The 4-point fixation technique provides better stabili-zation and better centration ， whereas the cow hitch knot ， which was applied to the lens haptics， provides sufficient stretch， avoiding unwanted slippage of the sutures on the haptics. Embedding the knots inside the eye is essen tial to minimize the risk of suture exposure through the con-junctiva， thus preventing potential endophthalmitis.\n\n【16】Similar techniques have been described for fixing IOLs with Gore-Tex sutures . However， the implant was larger in our patient， requiring a larger incision and more delicate manip-ulations inside the eye. Thus intraoperative IOP fluctuations(acute hypotony) and extra corneal damage had to be consid-ered. The technique used in the present patient combines the advantages of previously described techniques but utilizes an ab-externo approach. Sutures were first introduced inside the eye as loops， for easier grasping with the forceps， and subse-quently externalized from the adjacent sclerotomy. Both in-ternal loops were externalized from a small limbal incision， allowing the sutures to be tied to the haptics outside the eye(closed system) and enlarge the incision prior to lens inser-tion. This technique is safer， with less risk of acute hypotony. Manipulations are more delicate and less harmful.\n\n【17】The possible disadvantages of this technique may be related to the embedded knots， which may result in scleral thinning， as described for similar techniques entailing scleral flap cre-ation . Inserting the suture as a loop results in 4 exter-nalized suture ends， which can later confuse the surgeon， as the loops related to the lens may be unclear. The 2 spare sutures，1 from each side， should be removed prior to lens preparation. Another disadvantage is associated with the properties of the lens， as type 311 lenses can only be implanted through relative-ly large incisions (approximately 9 mm)， which may potential-ly induce astigmatism . These problems can be overcome by using a Carlevale scleral fixated IOL (Soleko) ， which is foldable， along with an artificial iris . However， there may be disadvantages when using 2 different implants， as the in-tegrity and symmetry of the eyeball may be compromised.\n\n【18】Conclusions\n\n【19】In conclusion， we have described a safer and more delicate technique for the management of patients with complicated eye trauma cases accompanied by aniridia and aphakia， with very favorable anatomically functional and cosmetic results. The Ophtec Lens 311 may be an effective alternative in the management of such cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Fibrocystic disease of the breast is a common occurrence in women， often representing physi-ological changes. However， the entity is much more infrequent in men， with only a few cases reported in the literature. When found in men， fibrocystic disease is usually associated with endocrine disturbance， genotype abnormalities or the use of specific offending drugs. Here we report the case of a middle-aged male patient with unilateral fibrocystic disease of the breast with no identifiable causative factor and review the available literature about the rare entity. Thus， one must keep an open mind while approaching any case， so that unusual occurrences are not blatantly missed.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS fibrocystic disease， male breast， breast disease， benign breast disease\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Fibrocystic change is a condition that affects up to 50% of women and clinically varies from asymptomatic to pain or discomfort in the affected breast. The condition usually requires no treatment， except in the case of large， symptomatic or suspicious cysts. The condition is hormonally linked， hence much more infrequent in the male population， and like disorders of the breast in males in general， is usually ignored. In males， fibrocystic change is usually manifested due to excess estrogen states or pathological change in pre-existing gynaecomastia. As lobule derivatives of the breast are sparse in males， the associated pathologies too are infrequent， and usually secondary consequences of an underly-ing causative factor like a genetic or endocrine abnormality.\n\n【4】Case report\n\n【5】A 55-year-old male patient from South India presented with complaints of swelling and pain in the right breast for the lastone month， which was insidious in onset and gradually progres-sive. There was no history of similar complaints in the past or in the contralateral breast and no history of discharge from the nipple. The patient did not give any history of trauma or fever. The patient was being managed for bipolar affective disorder for the last 10 years with the tricyclic antidepressant Prothiaden(25mg twice a day) and the benzodiazepine Clonazepam (0.5mg twice a day). He did not suffer from any other comorbidities. He was a social drinker and did not smoke. He was married with two children.\n\n【6】General physical examination was unremarkable， except for grade I clubbing in all digits. On local examination， slight full-ness was noted in the upper inner quadrant of the right breast， and the nipple-areolar complex was normal. Palpation revealed a 2x2 cm solitary， spherical， soft-to-firm swelling in the right periareolar region at the 2 o’clock position. The swelling was not fixed to the chest wall， mildly tender and did not exhibit signs of inflammation. No regional lymphadenopathy was appreci-ated， and the contralateral breast was normal. Secondary sexual characters were well-defined， and of the male pattern. Exami-nation of the genitalia was normal， and both testes symmetrical， well-developed and of normal volume. There were no stigmata of chronic liver disease or occult malignancy.\n\n【7】With a presumptive diagnosis of gynecomastia， a routine pre-operative evaluation was commenced. Routine investiga-tions done were within normal limits. Hormonal studies done including testosterone， prolactin， estrogen， progesterone， fol-licular stimulating hormone (FSH)， Luteinising hormone (LH)，\n\n【8】Gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) were all unremarkable. Mammogra-phy elucidated a BI-RADS 2 lesion， and FNAC of the lesion was done， which revealed the fibrocystic change.\n\n【9】The patient then underwent excision of the lesion under gen-eral anaesthesia， with circumareolar skin incision placed，from2'o clock to 5'o clock position. The lesion was well-circumscribed and easily dissected from surrounding normal breast tissue. The post-operative period was uneventful. Histopathological exami-nation of the excised lesion was reported as fibrocystic disease.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Fibrocystic disease of the breast is a common condition in fe-males， characterized by stromal fibrosis， ductal branching， intra-ductal epithelial proliferation and cyst formation . This is a rare finding in males， and very few cases have been reported in the literature.\n\n【12】Estrogen excess relative to progesterone is considered the causative factor for fibrocystic change in females， as estrogen stimulates proliferation of connective tissue as well as epithelial tissue . The pathophysiology in males is poorly understood and may represent hormonal changes， paraneoplastic syndrome， or more probably a morphological variation of gynaeco-mastia . No identifiable cause was present in our patient. A literature review with appropriate keywords did not reveal any link between the medication taken by the patient and fibrocystic change. Usually， the hormonally-associated disease tends to be bilateral and diffuse， whereas idiopathic lesions are unilateral and discrete . In our case， the lesion was unilateral， discrete and belongs to the idiopathic category.\n\n【13】Lesions of breast lobules including cysts， fibroadenoma and lobular neoplasia are rare in men. However， sporadic cases of such lesions have been reported， usually with associated underlying gynaecomastia . Histologically， fibro-cystic disease exhibits both progressive and regressive changes simultaneously. The former includes fibrosis， cyst formation and epithelial proliferation； and the latter is characterised by sclerosing adenosis， alveolar atrophy and calcification J. Cyst formation occurs due to obstruction of ducts by stromal fibrosis. Cyst fluid demonstrates various colours from serous， to milky to green-blue， depending on the stage of the disease and degradation of the cyst contents . Clinically patients usually present with pain or tenderness in the breast， developing over several months or years. Patients also often have associated menstrual disturbance. Occasionally， the presentation is due to nipple discharge .\n\n【14】Diagnosis is based on imaging and histology. Mammog-raphy reveals a dense pattern. Darker specks reflect epithelial-proliferative and nodular changes amid dense white background(\"buckshot\"breast). Additionally， microcalcifications may also be present. Ultrasound of the breast reveals echo-dense，inho-mogeneous areas of nodular-fibrosis and anechoic masses which represent the cysts. Needle aspiration is indicated in cases of diagnostic uncertainty or to rule out malignancy. In women with asymptomatic disease， only follow-up is required. Studies have shown that vitamin (specifically vitamin E) and iodine sup-plementation are beneficial . For discrete， large or suspicious lesions， excision is the treatment of choice.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】rovascular and other support elements. Any of these can po-tentially give rise to local growths-benign and malignant-in both men and women， and all possibilities should be considered in patients of both sexes before proceeding with a definitive management plan. Although rare，lobule-derived lesions of the breast occasionally occur in male patients， usually with under-lying gynaecomastia or in the setting of hormonal disturbance. After exclusion of malignancy， treatment principles mirror those applied in female patients， with excision of symptomatic or cosmetically displeasing lesions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation is used as both a bridging and destina-tion therapy for patients with advanced CHF. LVADs are reported to cause ventricular arrhythmias. Ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation (VF) are common fatal arrhythmias in patients with severe CHF if left untreated. We report a case in which a patient with an LVAD without an implantable cardioverter device (ICD) developed VF with non-classical symptoms with an unknown duration prior to defibrillation.\n\n【2】Case Report： A 74-year old man was brought to the hospital via Emergency Medical Services (EMS) with a 1-day history of altered mental status， somnolence， and slurred speech. His past medical history was significant for CHF with LVAD Heart Mate ll. An initial electrocardiogram (ECG) done by EMS was abnormal but was presumed to be an artifact secondary to LVAD. A 12-lead ECG done in the Emergency Center revealed VF. He required electrical defibrillation. Due to ongoing multiple organ failure， he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for fur-ther care.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】In the management of VF， the time to defibrillation is of paramount importance. LVAD patients could be in VF and present with non-specific symptoms. EMS personnel should be aware of this， as it can appear to be an ar-tifact on ECG.\n\n【5】MeSH Keywords： Arrhythmias， Cardiac · Heart-Assist Devices·Ventricular Fibrillation· Heart FailureCongestive heart failure (CHF) affects over 23 million individ-uals worldwide and over 5.8 million individuals in the United States. The lifetime risk of developing CHF in the United States is 1 in 5 . CHF is the inability of the heart to pump blood effectively at a level commensurate with the requirements of metabolizing tissues or with an elevated diastolic filling pres-sure. This leads to a backflow of blood in the circulatory sys-tem and volume overload (i.e.， pulmonary and liver congestion， pedal edema， and/or inadequate forward flow for function).\n\n【6】The management of CHF includes lifestyle modifications， phar-macologic agents， device therapies such as implantable cardio-verter-defibrillator (ICD)， and cardiac resynchronization therapy(CRT). In some cases， failure to improve with these modalities necessitates short-term mechanical circulatory support with the use of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) or even extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Despite these ef-forts， many patients continue to have advanced heart failure with worsening left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) refractory to medical therapy. The definitive treatment is a heart trans-plant， but this is contingent on donor availability； because of the inadequate supply of available organs， the use of mechan-ical circulatory support has gained widespread use. Circulatory support with the use of mechanical heart pumps is used to maintain heart function and perfusion， especially in patients refractory to medical therapy. Several pump types exist- bi-ventricular， right ventricular， or left ventricular- and the latter is most frequently used. A left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is used as both a bridging and destination therapy for patients with advanced CHF.\n\n【7】The use of LVAD results in improved survival rate and quality of life in patients with severe CHF . LVAD is reported to cause de novo ventricular arrhythmias (VA). The incidence of VA in LVAD patients is 22-59% . Ventricular tachycardia and ven-tricular fibrillation are common fatal arrhythmias in patients with severe CHF， if left untreated . The most important de-terminant of survival in VF is the time interval to defibrillation.\n\n【8】We report a case in which a patient with an LVAD without an ICD developed ventricular fibrillation with non-classical symp-toms with an unknown duration prior to being defibrillated.\n\n【9】Case Report\n\n【10】A 74-year old man was brought to the hospital via Emergency Medical Services (EMS). The medical history was obtained from his wife. He presented with a 1-day history of altered mental status，somnolence， and slurred speech. He was slightly lethar-gic and confused. Four days prior to this presentation， he hadflu-like symptoms and cough， which led to a decrease in oral intake and no bowel movements for 3 days. His past medical history was significant for CHF with LVAD (HeartMate Il) (set at 6000 revolutions per minute with a flow of 1.0-1.5 L/min-ute)， coronary arterial disease (CAD)， myocardial infarction(MI)， multiple coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)， periph-eral arterial disease (PAD)， ischemic cardiomyopathy， mitral regurgitation， hypertension， diabetes， hyperlipidemia， hypo-thyroidism， and recurrent Gl bleeds (Dieulafoy lesion， hemor-rhoid， and arteriovenous malformation). He was systemically anticoagulated with warfarin. Prior to admission， a preliminary electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained via EMS. They noted an abnormal ECG， but presumed it was an artifact secondary to LVAD. Physical examination revealed a pump sound on aus-cultation consistent with LVAD， no pulse (due to LVAD)； respi-ratory rate of 24； blood pressure of 71/60 mmHg； mean arte-rial pressure of 64 mmHg， and oxygen saturation of 86% via nasal cannula. A 12-lead ECG done in the Emergency Center revealed VF .\n\n【11】At the Emergency Center， he was shocked with 200 joules， which converted him back to sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 67 beats per minute . Following cardioversion， he was given l amiodarone and 4 liters of normal saline. On LVAD interrogation， the pump speed was at 8800 revolutions per minute with a flow of 4.8 to 7.7 liter per minute (showing the LVAD was functioning well).\n\n【12】The hemodynamic compromise due to prolonged VF result-ed in hypoperfusion of several vital organs. Most serum elec-trolyte levels and coagulation profile were abnormal. He had markedly elevated liver function test results， consistent with hypoperfusion of the liver and worsening kidney function. He was given fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vita-min K due to supratherapeutic INR. Due to the ongoing multi-ple organ failure， he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit(ICU) for further care.\n\n【13】During his hospitalization， a multidisciplinary approach was used； he had a total of 2 units of FFP， and continuous renalre-placement therapy (CRRT) was commenced due to worsening renal function. He was subsequently placed on heparin when his INR was less than 2. Two weeks into the hospital admis-sion， he developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular re-sponse， which was successfully cardioverted to normal sinus rhythm. Renal function improved on CRRT， but due to his co-morbidities， worsening organ dysfunction， and poor prognosis， palliative care was initiated. The family decided to proceed with comfort care and discontinue CRRT and LVAD. Following LVAD deactivation， the patient's mean arterial pressure dropped to the mid-30s. He died 40 minutes after withdrawal of the LVAD.\n\n【14】Ventricular assist devices are mechanical pumps that sup-plement the function of the damaged ventricle to re-estab-lish normal hemodynamics and end-organ perfusion. Devices can be placed via a median sternotomy into the left， right， or both ventricles of the heart； with the left ventricular devices being the most common. LVADs are used in patients with ad-vanced heart failure as a bridging therapy to cardiac transplan-tation or as a destination therapy. LVAD consists of an inflowcannula connected to the apex of the left ventricle， an out-flow cannula connected to the ascending aorta， and a pump-ing chamber that can be placed extracorporeally or intracor-poreally. Currently， there are 3 generations of ventricular assist devices： the first-generation devices with pulsatile flow pumps such as Heartmate XVE (Thoratec)， the second-generation de-vices with axial continuous flow pumps such as Heartmate ⅡI(Thoratec)， and the third-generation devices with centrifugal continuous flow pumps such as Heartmate III (Abbott) and the HVAD (Heart Ware) .\n\n【15】Table 1.

Approximately 20% of patients will develop ventricular ar-rhythmias (VAs) after LVAD placement， with ventricular fibril-lation being the most common . The risk of VAs after LVAD placement is associated with the underlying cardiac pathology， apical scarring around the inflow cannula， arrhythmias from suction events (LV underfilling or high pump speed)， and al-terations in ion channel gene expression .\n\n【19】Ventricular fibrillation is a life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia characterized by disorganized， high-frequency ventricular con-tractions that result in diminished cardiac output and hemo-dynamic collapse. Little is known of the pathophysiology of VF secondary to LVAD. Known risk factors of VF include car-diomyopathies， electrolyte abnormalities， acidosis， hypoxemia， and ischemia . This patient presented with electrolyte and metabolic derangements of unknown duration. We be-lieve that the patient's hemodynamic instability and labora-tory abnormalities prior to defibrillation led to multiple organ failure (heart， kidney， and liver).\n\n【20】Worsening organ dysfunction led to a decision by the patient's family to switch to comfort-based care. The family was ad-vised that without the use of LVAD and the support of CRRT， there was little chance of survival. Following much explana-tion at the request of the family， the patient discontinued di-alysis， which led to a rise in creatinine and urea nitrogen. He later was disconnected from mechanical circulatory support. Approximately 40 minutes later， he died.\n\n【21】In this case， the patient had CHF refractory to milrinone (New York Heart Association \\[NYHA\\] class IV milrinone dependent) which led to the LVAD placement (HeartMate2) on continu-ous flow set at 6000 revolutions per minute with a flow of1.0-1.5 L/minute 7 years prior to this event， as a destination therapy. Our patient was not placed on an ICD due to several contraindications (NYHA class I and failed medical therapy)， and he was a poor surgical candidate for heart transplant， which led to the placement of an LVAD without ICD. LVAD was used as a destination therapy due to the patient's history of diabe-tes and significant atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease， status after multiple reconstructions. His LVAD was interrogated and adjusted throughout the years with no significant arrhyth-mias until the most recent event， which led to his hospitaliza-tion. The actual onset of VF is uncertain since the patient did not have an ICD in place. It is also unclear if the patient had a de novo VF due to the LVAD or due to secondary causes (e.g.， CHF). To date， there have been several case reports revealing the tolerability of sustained VF with LVADs . However， there are limited data on the onset of ventricular fibrillation7 years after LVAD placement in a patient with NYHA class Ⅳ. Several studies have shown that patients on LVAD who sur-vived for more than 2-4 years had NYHA class l and II.In our case， our patient exhibited novel findings. He had dimin-ished cardiac functional capacity (NYHA class Ⅳ) at baseline and survived up to 7 years. In addition， unlike cases described in previous reports ， our case exhibited a unique VF with no ICD in situ to help determine the duration and frequency of the VF. With the increasing numbers of LVAD implanted，health care professionals， especially first responders， should be fa-miliar with patients on LVAD， as they may encounter atypi-cal presentation such as a conscious patient in VF without apulse who needs defibrillation. Such patients should be close-ly monitored for VF when presenting to the emergency room.\n\n【22】Conclusions\n\n【23】Left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) provide continuous per-fusion， and because many patients are pulseless at baseline， it can be difficult to identify VF when it does occur. Therefore， patients with LVADs should be closely monitored for arrhyth-mias when presenting with any type of illness. The American Heart Association recommends that if one suspects a cardiac arrest in an LVAD patient， bystander cardiopulmonary resus-citation should still be initiated.\n\n【24】In the management of VF， the time to defibrillation is of par-amount importance. Because the LVAD patient could be in VF and present with non-specific symptoms， emergency servicespersonnel should be aware of this， as it can appear to be an artifact on ECG.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Various neuroinflammatory conditions， cytokines， oxidative stress， neuropeptides and vasomotor changes have been hypothesized for the pathogenesis of migraine headaches. Aim and Objective： This study aimed to evaluate inflammatory and non-inflammatory marker levels in patients with migraine and compare them with levels measured in controls. Materials and Methods： This is a case-control study of 45 cases of migraine between the age group 15-50 years of either sex attending the outpatient department (OPD) of E.N.T， VIMSAR Burla between July 2019 to December 2019. After proper history and clinical evaluations， we analysed the serum level of inflammatory markers like Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR)， Malondialdehyde (MDA)， C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and anti-inflammatory marker Adiponectin in migraine patients. We compared blood levels of these parameters of migraine patients with 45 controls attending the same OPD for ENT diseases other than migraine during the same period. Results： The Unpaired t-test between case and control groups showed a significant increase in serum levels of NLR， MDA and CRP in migraine patients compared to controls(P ≤0.05). The case and control groups did not show a significant difference in the value of adiponectin. Conclusion： This study indicates that oxidative stress markers (MDA) and inflammatory markers like NLR and CRP may potentially be risk factors for migraine. So， early prediction of inflammatory markers might be beneficial in managingmigraine patients.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Migraine， Inflammatory markers， MDA， CRP，NLR\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Migraine is a primary headache disorder characterised by re-current headaches that are moderate to severe. Typically， the headaches affect one half of the head， pulsating in nature， last for 2 to 72 hours and may be associated with nausea， vomiting； and sensitivity to light， sound or smell. Several large epidemi-ological studies showed that the prevalence of migraine in the general population ranges from 6-13%.\n\n【4】In one-fifth of migraineurs， a neurological disturbance (visual， sensory or motor) appears during or before the migraine aura'sdevelopment. The accepted duration of most aura symptoms is 1hr， but motor symptoms are often longer lasting. Visual aura is the most common form of migraine aura， which consists of increased photophobia， dry eye， negative transient visual symptom changes(scintillating scotoma， obscuration of vision， tunnel vision， hemianopia) and positive， persistent visual phe-nomenon(visual snow， floaters or metamorphopsia with dis-torted contours and lightening symptoms).Usually， the visual symptoms come first during a migraine attack， followed by a pain attack.\n\n【5】The exact aetiology of migraine to date is not established. It has an environmental and genetic predisposition. It is associated with obesity， stress and depression. For most of the twen-tieth century， the prevailing theory of migraine held that pain results from abnormal dilatation of the intracranial blood ves-sels leading to mechanical excitation of the innervating sensory fibres.\n\n【6】This vascular theory has never been validated as there is no difference in blood flow velocity exists in vertebral and middle cerebral arteries during migraine attacks. Again consistent relationship between vessel calibre， cerebral blood flow and headache has not been established.\n\n【7】There has recently been mounting evidence of endothelial activation and dysfunction associated with migraine. Stress is the most common trigger factor of migraine. Oxidative stress is an imbalance between Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) produc-tion and their elimination by antioxidants. The decreasing antioxidant level increases oxidative stress， thus leading to in-flammation and changes in the pathophysiology of vessels. In response to stress， the number of neutrophils increases in circulation and the number of lymphocytes decreases. The pro-portion (NLR) is a useful marker of the pathophysiology of mi-graine.Thus stress leads to sterile inflammation of cerebral neurovasculature.\n\n【8】In this study， we aimed to evaluate the levels of inflammatory parameters like Neutrophil to lymphocyte Ratio (NLR)， oxida-tive stress marker Malondialdehyde (MDA)， C-Reactive Protein(CRP) and anti-inflammatory parameters like Adiponectin levels in patients with migraine and compare with levels measured in controls.\n\n【9】Materials and Methods\n\n【10】It was a hospital-based case-control study conducted after get-ting institutional ethical clearance. Patients attending the outpa-tient department of ENT， Veer Surendra Sai Institute of Medical Sciences and Research， Burla， Odisha， India， were taken for study during the period from July 2019 to December 2019. Sub-jects were described in the study， and written consent was taken. Clinically diagnosed migraine patients were selected as cases， and subjects attending the same OPD for ENT diseases other than migraine were selected as control.\n\n【11】Patients with complaints of intermittent headaches with or without aura associated with nausea or vomiting or visual dis-turbances triggered by stress were included in the study.\n\n【12】Patients with headaches diagnosed with fever， sinusitis， re-fractive error， intracranial complications， diabetes， hypertension， malignant disease， pregnant women， children below 15 years and elderly patients more than 50 years were excluded from the study.\n\n【13】NLR，MDA， CRP and Adiponectin were studied in the Bio-chemistry department and compared in study groups.8ml of venous blood was drawn from all participants after taking asep-tic precautions and 12 hours of fasting.\n\n【14】A complete blood count (CBC) was done using an automated haematology analyser(ACCULAB CBC-360).NLR was calcu-lated by dividing the absolute neutrophil count(ANC) value by absolute lymphocyte count(ALC). Malondialdehyde (MDA) was evaluated by the Satoh et al. method.Estimating C-Reactive Protein (CRP) was done using the standard nephelometry pro-cedure. The assay of Adiponectin was performed by ELISA Method (Erba) as per the manufacturer’s instructions.\n\n【15】The data were analyzed using statistical software SPSS (Statis-tical Package for the Social Sciences，IBM Corporation， Armonk， New York) Version 20. Data were presented as mean ± standard deviation. Statistical analysis was done by unpaired t-test. The corresponding values in different groups were compared statis-tically by determining the \"p\"value. p <0.05 was considered to be significant statistically.\n\n【16】We recruited 90 subjects for the study. Forty-five subjects clini-cally diagnosed with migraine constituted the case group， and45 subjects attending the ENT outpatient department for dis-eases other than migraine of similar age and sex constituted the control group.\n\n【17】The study included 45 migraine patients with a mean age of32.9 years ranging from 15-50 years. There were 12 males and33 females. Out of 33 females，5 had had a history of aura i.e.， visual disturbances before a migraine attack. The mean age of the control group was 32.6 years， with 18 males and 27 females. The mean value of BMI was 24.3±2.4 and 24.62±2.5 in cases and controls， respectively， which was statistically insignificant.\n\n【18】The mean Haemoglobin level in cases and control groups were13.7±2.2 and 13.8±2.3， respectively， which is not significant statistically. \n\n【19】The mean level of NLR in cases was 2.16+0.35， higher than the control group with a mean value of 1.59±0.42. The level of MDA was higher in migraine patients with a mean value of3.0+0.58. Similarly， the mean value of CRP was 6.08±1.04， which was also higher compared to the control group. \n\n【20】But the mean value of adiponectin was statistically insignifi-cant between study groups， with mean values of 7.06±1.02 and7.15±1.07， respectively. \n\n【21】Table 1 Demographic characteristics of migraine cases and controls.\n\n| Variable  | Case (n=45)  | Control (n=45)  | Pvalue  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Variable  | (mean±SD)  | (mean±SD)  | Pvalue  |\n| Age  | 32.9±6.7  | 32.6±6.8  | 0.834  |\n| BMI(kg/m-)  | 24.3±2.4  | 24.6±2.5  | 0.561  |\n\n【23】n： Number of subjects.

Various factors are responsible for the development of migraine. It is generally defined as a recurrent headache lasting2-72 hours. Its worldwide prevalence is 13-15% affecting both genders.Various mechanisms have been proposed for the pathogenesis of migraine， including vascular dysfunction， neu-rogenic， inflammatory and activation of the trigeminovascular pathway.\n\n【28】The mean age of our patients was 32.9 years. Steiner TJ et al. and Stovener et al. concluded that migraine usually affects pa-tients below 50 years.In our study， females are more affected than males.\n\n【29】Previous studies showed that in the female sex， headaches are more common and affect approximately 20.3 million young and middle-aged women worldwide.\n\n【30】The data presented in this study showed that NLR values in migraineurs were significantly higher compared with control subjects. Previous studies have also investigated the value of this marker in evaluating migraine patients.A neutrophil is an active nonspecific inflammatory mediator of cellular im-munity， while lymphocytes mediate inflammation's adaptive or protective aspect. So， an increased NLR value in migraine groups in our study suggests underlying inflammatory patho-physiology of migraine. However， NLR has been used in eval-uating and prognosis of various disease processes， including coronary artery diseases， malignancies， and neurological and rheumatologic diseases.\n\n【31】Our study showed a significant difference between the serum level of MDA in patients and the control group.MDA is a lipid peroxidation product， an acceptable biomarker of oxidative stress， and an indicator of increased production of reactive oxygen species(ROS). Oxidative stress and neuroinflamma-tion play an important role in migraine pathogenesis. Previous studies showed that migraine patients may have a higher level of NO- metabolites and Malondialdehyde(MDA) compared to healthy subjects， which are consistent with our study.\n\n【32】Our study revealed that the value of CRP is higher in mi-graineurs than in control which is statistically significant and indicates inflammatory pathogenesis. Vanmolkot FH et al. con-cluded that increased CRP levels in young adult patients with migraines. However， CRP is a marker of inflammation that may predict subclinical atherosclerosis. Its levels are increased in vascular diseases and healthy individuals without cardiovas-cular diseases.High levels of this proinflammatory cytokine in our study may reflect the inflammatory status of migraine.\n\n【33】The present study found no significant association between migraine and serum adiponectin levels. No significant differ-ence was detected in adiponectin levels between cases and control groups， consistent with Bernecker C et al. and Tiet-jen GE et al. Adiponectin is a 244 amino acid protein discovered in 1995.Studies show that adipokines like lep-tin and adiponectin play important roles in the pathophysi-ology of chronic headaches. Both have been associated with migraine episodes， particularly with aura patients with more prevalent inflammatory components. Again， previous studies showed that the anti-inflammatory and inflammatory role of adiponectin oligomer depends on its molecular weight. Low molecular weight(LMW) oligomer has been related to anti-inflammatory while high molecular weight(HMW) oligomer to pro-inflammatory effects and participates in migraine patho-physiology， particularly in chronic migraine.\n\n【34】In our study， we measure the total adiponectin level with-out differentiating its isoforms， particularly low molecular weight(LMW) adipokine， which is a limitation in our study. Variation in serum adiponectin between individuals depends on various factors like BMI， age， physical activities， hormonal status etc. We have adjusted various parameters like weight， height， and age in our study except for the hormonal status of either sex. So further research is needed on migraine patients， particularly patients with aura， which is a limitation in our study due to the small number of  patients. Our study’s lack of adiponectin variations might be related to the complex mechanism underly-ing migraine pathophysiology.\n\n【35】Increased inflammatory biomarkers like NLR，MDA and CRPin our study suggest inflammatory pathophysiology of migraine. Early evaluation of these markers may help in early diagnosis and better treatment in migraine patients. A larger group with a longer period can be evaluated to get better results.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

While pediatric intussuscep-tion is well known and almost always idiopathic， an underlying cause is usually found in adults. Indication for surgical treatment and intussusception reduction before resection remain controversial in Al. Here， we present an uncommon case of an immunocompromised patient who had multiple intussusceptions.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 59-year-old woman， who had received a kidney-pancreas transplant for type 1 diabetes with end-stage re-nal failure， was admitted to our Intensive Care Unit for septic shock of suspected pulmonary origin. A thoraco-abdominal CT scan demonstrated signs of bilateral pneumonia and multiple abdominal intuss usceptions， for which she underwent surgery. Four intestinal intussusceptions were found. Manual desinvagination was per-formed without bowel resection. After surgery， the patient presented a new bowel obstruction， requiring a sec-ond surgery， showing recurrence of 1 intussusception. Segmental resection was indicated， but not performed because of the septic shock， requiring high-dose noradrenalin. The patient progressed toward multi-organ fail-ure， leading to her death a few days later. An autopsy revealed that multiple adenomas were responsible for the intussusceptions.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】This case confirms that Al is rarely a spontaneous disease and that the therapeutic strategy should be planned accordingly. There is currently no systematic approach for Al， and guidelines are needed to improve its management.\n\n【6】MeSH Keywords： Adult ·Immunosuppression·Intussusception\n\n【7】Adult intussusception (Al) is a rare condition that accounts for1% to 5% of all cases of bowel obstruction . It is defined by the protrusion of a proximal bowel segment with his mes-entery (intussusceptum) through the lumen of a distal bow-el segment (intussuscipiens)， resulting in occlusion . Prolonged invagination causes edema， which can compromise the blood flow， resulting in ischemia and， if left untreated， ne-crosis and perforation .\n\n【8】While pediatric intussusception is well known and mostly id-iopathic， an underlying cause is found in 90% of adult cas-es . Among the underlying lesions， malignan-cy accounts for 40% to 60% and predominates in the large bowel . Furthermore， the risk of developing malignancies is increased in patients on immunosuppressive therapy .\n\n【9】Although clinical presentation in children is sudden， with acute symptoms such as abdominal pain， abdominal mass， and bloody mucoid stools (the classical triad)， adult presentation can be insidious， with intermittent or even chronic symptoms， which can delay the diagnosis. Symptoms of intestinal obstruction are the most common. Others symptoms such as palpable mass or melena are less common .\n\n【10】The management of Al is controversial regarding indications for surgery and the necessity or feasibility to reduce the intussus-ception before a resection. Here， by reporting an uncommon case of an immunocompromised patient who had 4 intussus-ceptions， and by performing a literature review， we attempt to clarify the management of this disease .\n\n【11】Case Report\n\n【12】A 59-year-old woman was transferred from a peripheral hos-pital to our Intensive Care Unit for suspected pulmonary sep-tic shock. She had a history of type-1 diabetes with end-stage renal failure， for which she had received a combined kidney-pancreas transplant 20 years ago and a second kidney trans-plant 7 years ago. She was on a mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus immunosuppressive regimen.\n\n【13】At the time of admission， she had received a 10-day course of intravenous antibiotics， with no clinical improvement. Both kidney and pancreas graft function were optimal， with normal creatinine level and glycemia within normal range. A thoraco-abdominal CT scan demonstrated bilateral pleural effusion with signs of bilateral pneumonia and multiple abdominal intussus-ceptions . Immunosuppressive treatment was discon-tinued and it was decided to perform an exploratory laparoto-my. Free intra-abdominal liquid and 4 sites of intussusceptionwere found at 20， 30， 70 and 150 centimeters up from the il-eocecal valve . All 4 intussusception sites presented an intramural lesion. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative dis-order was suspected， and a biopsy of one of the lesions was taken. In the absence of bowel ischemia and to avoid exten-sive bowel resection， only manual desinvagination was per-formed. Histopathological analysis later revealed a low-grade tubulovillous adenoma.\n\n【14】Twelve days later， the patient presented a new episode of bow-el obstruction， with a CT scan showing 1 intussusception. It also demonstrated progression of the pulmonary infection. The patient was taken again to the operating room， and a recur-rence of the intussusception at the proximal site was found. Segmental resection was theoretically indicated， but， due to hemodynamic instability secondary to septic shock requiring vasoactive support， it was decided to refrain from respective surgery and to proceed again with a manual reduction of the invagination. Following surgery， the patient showed no clini-cal improvement. She progressed toward multiple organ fail-ure (MOF) and eventually died 6 days after second surgery. Autopsy revealed multiple tubulovillous adenomas. It also showed massive necrosis of the pancreas graft， with throm-bosis of the pancreatic artery. Finally， a pulmonary adenocar-cinoma was found in the left lower lobe， with multiple bilat-eral pulmonary metastases and lymphangitic carcinomatosis.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Etiology\n\n【17】Al is an unusual cause of intestinal obstruction. The mean age is 50 years， without a sex predominance . It is the result of an organic cause in up to 90% of cases and idiopathic in about10% . It can appear on every part of the gastrointesti-nal tract， but seems to occur more frequently at the junction between freely moving and retroperitoneally fixed segments or segments fixed by adhesions . Idiopathic intussus-ceptions are mostly found in those regions， especially at the ileocecal junction .\n\n【18】Although some studies showed an equal distribution between small and large bowel， a predominance of small bowel intus-susception is found (60% to 81%).\n\n【19】A malignant origin is found in about 1/3 of small-bowel in-tussusceptions and 2/3 of large-bowel intussusceptions . Malignant lesions in the small bowe! are usually second-ary lesions， while in the large bowel， they are almost always primaries.\n\n【20】Many benign or malignant lesions can cause Al. Etiologies are summarized in Figure 3.\n\n【21】Clinical presentation and investigation\n\n【22】In contrast to children， clinical presentation in adults is gener-ally nonspecific and insidious. Patients usually complain of ab-dominal pain， constipation， and vomiting， and， less frequently，melena or abdominal mass . In case of malignancy， symp-toms like weight loss， asthenia， and hematochezia can also be present . Acute abdominal pain can occur， mostly in case of peritonitis resulting from necrosis and perforation. Finally， intussusception can be asymptomatic and is more frequent-ly discovered with the increasing use of abdominal CT scans.\n\n【23】Diagnosis is rarely made based on patient history and clin-ical findings. Abdominal ultrasound is a useful tool to diag-nose intussusception， especially in children. The characteris-tic findings include the “target\" and “doughnut”signs on the transverse view and the “pseudo-kidney\" sign on the lateralview . Abdominal ultrasound is relatively inexpensive and widely available but operator-dependent， and the pres-ence of air in the distended bowels can lead to difficult inter-pretation and poor image quality.\n\n【24】CT scan is the most accurate study， with a positive result in70% to 100% of cases. The classic features are the “target”or “sausage-shaped\" sign . CT scans can iden-tify the precise localization of the intussusception， as well as showing potential intraluminal masses or positive lymph nodes. Free fluid or air and signs of ischemia such as wall thickening and lack of enhancement of the bowel wall can also be easi-ly seen. Radiological studies reported that an intussusception length <4 cm and a diameter <3.2 cm are more likely to re-solve with conservative treatment . On the contrary， 6factors were found to be associated with an underlying cause：male sex， colonic involvement， visualization of a pathological lead point， abdominal pain， distal bowel diameter ≥27 mm， and a wall thickness 23 mm .\n\n【25】Management\n\n【26】Many factors influence the management of Al： patient charac-teristics， age， small versus large bowel， emergency situations versus chronic presentation， and incidental findings.\n\n【27】Although treatment by contrast or air insufflation is the treat-ment of choice in the pediatric population， it is not indicated in adults . Surgery is considered as the primary treatmentof Al in symptomatic patients. The surgical approach can be open or minimally invasive， depending on emergency situa-tions， surgeon experience or preference， and localization .\n\n【28】In case of large-bowel intussusception， a surgical approach should be chosen because of the risk of malignancy . Depending on the perioperative findings， oncological resec-tion may be performed， and perioperative histology assess-ment can help in the decision . The intussusception should not be reduced because of the risks of vascular and intra-ab-dominal tumor cells dissemination and increased risks of per-foration or anastomotic complications due to the weakened bowel wall .\n\n【29】The management of symptomatic small bowel intussuscep-tion in adults is more controversial. Patient history， clinical pre-sentation， and radiological findings are essential to make the most appropriate therapeutic decision. In the absence of any sign of complications or in case of an incidental finding， con-servative treatment is recommended. A radiological examina-tion must be carried out within 5 to 7 days to ensure resolu-tion of the intussusception. In this case， a low-dose CT scan is the best choice .\n\n【30】If surgery is indicated， patients without any previous surgery should be treated by manual reduction before resection， to minimize the length of the resected segment. In case of mul-tiple intussusceptions， a perioperative biopsy should be per-formed to identify the etiology and to avoid extensive bow-el resection， which can result in a short-bowel syndrome. For example， multiple polyps can be seen in Peutz-leghers syn-drome and can be responsible for repeated intussusceptions； a combination of polypectomy and limited bowel resection is the best approach in this situation .\n\n【31】In patients with a history of abdominal surgery， a “watch and wait approach\" is acceptable since adhesions can cause the intussusception. If symptoms do not resolve spontaneously， surgery is the treatment of choice.\n\n【32】In all cases， if clinical history and/or radiological findings show signs of complications (e.g.， acute abdominal pain， weight loss， asthenia， free intra-abdominal air or fluid， and lack of parietal enhancement)， surgery has to be considered. If an oncologi-cal etiology is suspected， and if clinical presentation allows it， a complete oncological assessment should be carried out. To help physicians in patient management， we developed a de-cision tree .\n\n【33】Patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment are at high-er risk of developing malignancies. The most common cancers seen in immunosuppressed transplant recipients are non-mel-anoma skin cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Several oth-er types of malignancies have higher relative risks. Lung can cer， as seen in the present case， also has a significantly higher incidence in immunosuppressed patients， with a relative risk of 1.4 . Tubulovillous adenomas have not been associated with immunosuppressive treatment， but have the potential to progress to adenocarcinoma in the colon .\n\n【34】In the present case， we faced multiple intussusceptions in an immunocompromised patient. In the absence of ischemia， because the patient was in severe sepsis with a high risk of anastomotic leakage， and in view of the length of intestine involved， bowe! resection was avoided. The histological as-sessment performed perioperatively showed no sign of malig-nancy but did show several adenomas. The patient had a re-currence， but because of her general condition， resection and anastomosis would have been too risky. The most likely cause of death was the pulmonary insufficiency on bilateral pneumo-nia and the advanced lung cancer. The autopsy also showed necrosis of the pancreatic graft with thrombosis of the artery. Despite this discovery， the patient had preserved pancreatic graft function， and， notably， no exogenous insulin treatment was required. This was most probably the result of the hyper-coagulable state secondary to septic shock.\n\n【35】It is unlikely that the intussusceptions were the reason for MOF； therefore， it is unlikely that a more aggressive approach during the first surgery would have improved the outcome. On the contrary， the poor hemodynamic status of the patient combined with multiple bowel resections/anastomosis would have put the patient at a high risk of complications.\n\n【36】Conclusions\n\n【37】Intussusception is a rare condition in adults， with various clin-ical presentations.Abdominal CT scan is the imaging modality of choice. There is currently no clinical or scientific evidence in-dicating a preferred treatment. Therefore， each case should be assessed individually. The presented case confirms that adult intussusception is rarely a spontaneous disease and that the therapeutic strategy should be planned accordingly.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Aim： To determine whether Intubating laryngeal mask airway or Laryngoscopy cause minimal stress response following intubation in normotensive as well as in hypertensive patients. Methods： This was a randomized control trial study. Two control groups were formed. They were in the age 18 to 65 year belonging to ASA I and II. Group， I patients was intubated with Macintosh laryngoscope and group II were intubated with the help of ILMA. Vitals monifored were Heart rate， Systolic blood pressure， Diastolic blood pressure and Mean arterial pressure at baseline， before induction， after induction， after intubation at 1， 3 and 5 minutes intervals. Pharyngolaryngeal morbidity was also recorded and followed for 24 hours following procedures. Results were analyzed using Mann-Whitney Test and the Independent t-test. The qualitative variables were analyzed using the Chi-Square test/Fisher’s Exact test. Result： Demographic， as well as vital parameters， showed no significant differences between the two groups. The decrease in stress response was seen in normotensive patients only in group II but not in hypertensive patients. Conclusion： Intubating laryngeal mask airway did not help in blunting the stress response when compared with Macintoshlaryngoscope in hypertensive patients but a decrease in stress response was seen in normotensive patients at 3 minutes after infubation. Though it can be used as an alternative method for intubation.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Diastolic blood pressure， Heart rate， Intubating LMA，laryngoscope， Systolic blood pressure\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Adverse responses in the cardiovascular， respiratory and other physiologic systems are noted when direct laryngoscopy and passage of a tracheal tube is attempted since these are considered noxious stimuli by the body . Laryngoscopy done for endo-tracheal intubation causes stimulation of Pharyngolaryngeal structure， which in turns leads to sympathetic stimulation， and this response is non-desirable in normotensive as well as inhypertensive patients. It can lead to cerebrovascular accidents， intracranial bleeds， increase in intracranial pressure， arrhythmia， myocardial infarction in already compromised heart functions. On the other hand， the insertion of an LMA is associated with fewer hemodynamic changes， and also， the duration of change is short . The study by N. Braude et al.  is a pointer that laryngoscopy gives more stimulus than the lesser stimulus when we use LMA.\n\n【4】An ideal technique to mitigate adverse haemodynamic re-sponses to intubation has yet to be found and perfected even though many methods have been tried. For example， to blunt this sympathetic rise， many different drugs have been trialled； different methods of intubation have been done， and still many other researches are underway. One innovative method is to do intubation with intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA). It causes less stimulation of the oropharyngeal structure. Theoretically， it has been suggested that intubation throughILMA will cause a less hemodynamic response in comparison to intubation with direct laryngoscopy Few studies have been done to compare the stress response following intubating LMA and laryngoscopy， but the results are conflicting . So we took up this study to find out the relationship of rising in stress response following endotracheal intubation with ILMA and conventional laryngoscope in both normotensive and hyper-tensive patients and whether ILMA is associated with minimal hemodynamic changes or not.\n\n【5】Materials and Methods\n\n【6】This randomised control trial single-blinded study was done in the Department of Anaesthesia， Central Referral Hospital， Gang-tok， Sikkim， from January 2020 January 2021. All ASA GRADEI and II patients， whether normotensive or hypertensive，coming for surgery under general anaesthesia between 18 to 65 Years were included in our study. Patients of ASA GRADE II and IV， patients with anticipated difficult airways， cerebrovascular diseases and gastroesophageal reflux diseases were excluded.\n\n【7】The allocation of the sample is shown in the consort flow diagram .

All patients had to undergo pre anaesthesia check-ups. Objectives and procedures to be followed were ex-plained to the patients， and informed consent for anaesthesia was taken. Patients were allocated into two groups-each group comprised 50 patients. Patients of Group I was intubated with the Macintosh laryngoscope and Group ⅡI patients with ILMA.\n\n【9】Randomisation was done by using the envelopes method. A hundred envelopes were kept ready in sequentially numbered， which was opaque and sealed. A white piece of paper was placed inside the envelope labelled either Group I and GroupⅡ. The aluminium foil inside the envelope was used to render it impermeable to intense light. The envelope was sealed using a stapler. The patients coming to the OT for surgery were asked to choose an envelope. The group inside the envelope then decided the groups they were assigned to.\n\n【10】The hypertensive patient took their antihypertensive drug on the morning of the surgery at their usual daily scheduled time. All the patients received similar anaesthesia. Their pulse， blood pressure， SPo2 were recorded， and good Ⅳ access was obtained on the operation table. All the patients received inj. ondansetron 0.08mg/kg，inj. Glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg and 2 ug/kg fentanyl intravenously as premedication before induction. Af-ter preoxygenation， the patient was anaesthetised with propo-fol (2-2.5 mg/kg)， and Injection vecuronium (0.1 mg/kg) was given for intubation. Then the patient was ventilated with in-termittent positive pressure ventilation with 100% oxygen for3-5 minute. Patients in Group I was intubated with a cuffed PVC (polyvinylchloride) tube using a Macintosh laryngoscope. In Group II， the intubating laryngeal mask of size 3 or 4 was inserted， and the cuff of ILMA was inflated with 20-30 ml of air. Then it was connected to the anaesthesia machine. Adequate ventilation was judged by bilateral equal chest wall movement and capnography on the monitor. Then reinforced cuffed， sili-cone tracheal tube was passed through ILMA. The cuff of the tube was inflated， and the circuit was attached. The correct in-tubation was confirmed clinically by the presence of bilateralbreath sound and by capnography. If any obstruction or force was required or oesophageal intubation took place， then certain adjusting manoeuvres was tried like： the airway was optimised， the air was added to the cuff， partial withdrawal of the tube or up-down manoeuvre of ILMA. If it was not successful despite all the above manoeuvres， then the patient was intubated through a laryngoscope. Once the intubation was done， then the ILMA was removed with the help of stabilising rod. After that， anaes-thesia was maintained with 1-2% isoflurane and 50% nitrous oxide with oxygen. The values of vitals like Heart Rate (HR)， Systolic Blood pressure (SBP)， Diastolic Blood Pressure(DBP)， Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) was recorded at baseline， before induction (i.e. after premedication)， after induction， after intuba-tion at 1， 3 and 5 minutes respectively by an OT staff who was unaware about the type of study. Any pharyngolaryngeal mor-bidity in 24 hours was also noted， like sore throat， hoarseness of voice and any mucosal or dental injury.\n\n【11】Statistical Analysis\n\n【12】The data entry was analyzed using (SPSS) software version 21.0. The p-value <0.05 was taken statistically significant. The cate-gorical variables were presented in number and percentage(%) and the continuous variables as mean±SD. The data normality was checked by using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The quan-titative variables were analyzed using Mann-Whitney Test and the Independent t-test. The qualitative variables were analyzed using the Chi-Square test/Fisher’s Exact test.\n\n【13】Results\n\n【14】The results were interpreted， firstly by taking all the patients(both normotensive and hypertensive) from the two groups. Secondly， only normotensive patients from both groups were an-alyzed. Finally，only hypertensive patients from the two groups were analyzed.\n\n【15】The result between the two groups did not show any sig nificant differences regarding Age， Sex， Weight， ASA Physical Status . There were 34 (68%) normotensive and 16(32%) hypertensive patients in Group I and 31 (62%) normotensive and 19 (38%) hypertensive patients against Group II.\n\n【16】The baseline values of HR， SBP， DBP and MAP were com-parable between both groups. There was also no significant difference between the vitals before and after induction among both groups. The sharp rise was seen in the vitals at intervals of 1， 3 and 5 minutes after intubation in both the groups when compared with post-induction records， but there was a minimal rise in blood pressure from the baseline values . In both， the group the increase in the HR from the baseline as well as af-ter induction was significant but not statistically significant. The rise in SBP， DBP and MAP was also seen after intubation in both the groups， which was comparable. SBP remained high in both groups at the end of 1 and 3 minutes intervals after intubation， but it was statistically insignificant . The SBP at the end of 5 minutes in both the groups was decreased to near the after induction value and was statistically significant (p=0.015).\n\n【17】The decrease in DBP in Group Ⅱ at the end of 3 and 5 minutes intervals after intubation was statistically significant (P<0.05)).\n\n【18】The MAP of Group I remained high even at the 5 minutes intervals after intubation. In contrast， in Group ⅡI， there was a decrease in the value at the 3 and 5 minutes intervals after intu-bation from baseline and was statistically significant. \n\n【19】Table 1 Comparison of socio-demographic characteristics between group.\n\n| Parameters  | Group I(n=50)  | Group II (n=50)  | P-value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age (Years) Mean ±SD  | 40.04±11.57  | 41.2±11.35  | 0.754  |\n| Gender (Female：Male】  | 32(64%)：18(36%)  | 32(64%)：18(36%)  | 1  |\n| ASA III  | 34(68%)：16(32%)  | 31(62%)：19(38%)  | 0.529  |\n| Weight(Kg) Mean±SD  | 61.76±9.88  | 62.32±8.24  | 0.587  |\n| Normotensive/Hypertensive  | 34(68%)：16(32%)  | 31(62%)：19(38%)  | 0.529  |\n\n【21】Table 2 Comparison of Mean value of Heart Rate recorded at different interval of time\n\n| Heart Rate(per minute)  | GROUPI(n=50) Mean±SD  | GROPU II(n=50) Mean±SD  | p-value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BASELINE  | 85.04±14.32  | 84.56±12.89  | 0.661  |\n| BEFORE INDUCTION  | 82.78±13.08  | 82.96±12.28  | 0.795  |\n| AFTERINDUCTION  | 77.26±12.04  | 77.7±11.77  | 0.691  |\n| ET1  | 102.48±10.95  | 100.68±9.2  | 0.197  |\n| E13  | 99.62±8.86  | 97.06±7.64  | 0.153  |\n| E15  | 93.84±9.46  | 91.44±10.09  | 0.226  |\n\n【23】ET1= Value at 1 minute after intubation，ET3= value at 3 minute after intubation，ET5= value at 5 minute after intubation\n\n【24】Table 3 Comparison of Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) recorded at various time interval.\n\n| SBP(mmHg)  | GROUP I (n= 50)Mean±SD  | GROPU II(n=50)Mean±SD  | p-value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BASE LINE  | 131.36±15.06  | 131.34±11.87  | 0.994  |\n| BEFORE INDUCTION  | 127.94±12.64  | 127.94±10.39  | 1  |\n| AFTERINDUCTION  | 107.46±15.24  | 108.88±15.64  | 0.646  |\n| E11  | 133.84±22.35  | 130.02±18.76  | 0.356  |\n| ET3  | 113.4±17.08  | 108.8±13.59  | 0.139  |\n| ET5  | 106.02±15.64  | 99.48±10.34  | 0.015  |\n\n【26】Table 4 Comparison of Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) recorded at various time interval.\n\n| DBP(mmHg)  | GROUPI(n=50) Mean ±SD  | GROPUII(n=50) Mean±SD  | p-value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BASE LINE  | 80.4±9.63  | 79.52±11.11  | 0.673  |\n| BEFORE INDUCTION  | 77.54±9.9  | 76.1±10.33  | 0.478  |\n| AFTERINDUCTION  | 66.4±13.3  | 65.32±10.68  | 0.655  |\n| ET1  | 85.9±16.99  | 82.56±11.56  | 0.253  |\n| ET3  | 71.5±11.65  | 65.28±9.04  | 0.003  |\n| ET5  | 68.14±10.69  | 60.52±7.49  | 0.0001  |\n\n【28】Table 5 Comparison of Mean Arterial Blood Pressure (MAP) recorded at various time interval\n\n| MAP(mmHg)  | GROUPI (n=50)Mean± SD  | GROPUII(n=50) Mean±SD  | p-value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BASE LINE  | 94.38±10.88  | 94.88±10.83  | 0.818  |\n| BEFORE INDUCTION  | 91.72±10.29  | 92.1±9.93  | 0.851  |\n| AFTERINDUCTION  | 77.58±13.37  | 78.98±11.88  | 0.581  |\n| ET1  | 99.56±18.84  | 97.68±13.53  | 0.568  |\n| ET3  | 84.06±13.06  | 79.02±9.89  | 0.032  |\n| ET5  | 79.32±11.62  | 72.34±7.36  | 0.0006  |\n\n【30】Table 6 Comparison of pharyngolaryngeal morbidity (24hrs)\n\n| Pharyngolaryngeal  | Group I  | Group II  | Total  | P value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| morbidity (24hrs)  | (n=50)  | (n=50)  |  |  |\n| Sore throat  | 7(14%)  | 6(12%)  | 13(13%)  | 0.766  |\n| Hoarseness  | 13(26%)  | 7(14%)  | 20(20%)  | 0.134  |\n| Mucosal injury  | 7(14%)  | 7(14%)  | 14(14%)  | 1  |\n| Dental injury  | 0(0%)  | 0(0%)  | 0(0%)  | No p value  |\n\n【32】When only hypertensive patients vitals of both the group were compared ， it was found that there was a rise in all the vitals values from the baseline till 5 minutes after intubation. There was only a decrease in the DBP in the Group IIhyperten-sive patients at the end of 5 minutes intervals after intubation and was significant statistically (P=0.029). The vitals were also compared among normotensive patients of both groups . HR remained high in both the groups till the end of 5 minutes after intubation， but there was a statistically significant decrease in the SBP in Group I compared to Group I at the end of 1，3，5minutes intervals after intubation (P=0.043，P=0.014，P=0.0007). The decrease in DBP was also statistically significant in Group II at the end of 3 and 5 minutes intervals after intubation (P=0.001， P= 0.0001). The statistically significant decrease in MAP was also found in Group II normotensive patients at 3 and 5 minutes intervals (P=0.003， P=0.0002). The decrease in SBP， DBP and MAP was also seen in Group I at the end of 3 and 5 minutes intervals. The pharyngolaryngeal morbidity was seen in both the groups， which were comparable .\n\n【33】Discussion\n\n【34】There is a change in hemodynamic parameters following laryn-goscopy and endotracheal intubation  as well as during LMA placement . This change is due to stimulation of the upper respiratory structure and tracheobronchial tree. Laryngoscopy initiates these changes due to the tip of the blade pressing on the base of the tongue and lifting the epiglottis. The studies have emphasized that this stress response is augmented by endotra-cheal intubation and can lead to cardiac arrhythmia. The tongue is not distorted， or the receptors of the larynx stimulated when we use ILMA guided intubation . Pharyngeal wall structures are also not distorted by ILMA when placed over the glottis. Therefore there is less oropharyngeal stimulation . Thus it is considered that ILMA will cause a less hemodynamic response. The rise in stress and HR following laryngoscopy and tracheal in-tubation is transient till a maximum of 30-45 seconds and returnsto control level within four minutes . This rise is transient but may have a deleterious effect on an already compromised heart and cerebrovascular disease. So ILMA was thought to be one of the methods that can help in intubation without causing much effect on hemodynamic response. In our study， both the groups following endotracheal intubation showed a rise in heart rate well within 20 % of the baseline. This rise was maximum at1 minute following intubation and did not return to the baseline level even at the end of 5 minutes in both the groups. The same trend was also seen when both normotensive and hypertensive patients were compared separately. However， this finding was not statistically significant. A similar finding was seen in Jayita et al.  and Sener et al.\n\n【35】The rise was seen in SBP， DBP and MAP in both the group at1 minute after intubation from baseline， which was not clinically significant. However， these rises were not statistically significant. This finding of minimal rise from baseline in our study could be due to the deep plane of anaesthesia achieved using Fen-tanyl at two ug/kg and propofol 2-2.5 mg /kg. The study was done by Kihara et al.  on 150 patients also failed to demon-strate any significant difference between the two groups at any time. In their study， all the patients received intravenous 0.5mg/kg lignocaine， 2.5 mg/kg propofol and maintained with 2%sevoflurane along with O2 and Nitrous oxide. They explained it could be due to lignocaine， greater depth of anaesthesia， or the different sequence and time taken for adjusting manoeuvres with ILMA. A similar finding was found in Zhang et al.  study. Syal et al. ， in their study， compared hemodynamic response following intubation with direct laryngoscopy， Light wand and ILMA. They used 1.5ug/kg Fentanyl， 1.5 mg/kg propofol and 0.5 mg /kg rocuronium. After that， they gave propofol 0.5 mg /kg while ventilating with O2 before intuba-tion. They also did not find any significant difference in MAP between the three groups though there was a significant rise in each group compared with preintubation value. The MAP at the end of 5 minutes was less than the preintubation value. This finding was similar to our study.\n\n【36】Table 7 Comparison of Hemodynamic changes in both normotensive and hypertensive patient.

Choyce et al.  took three Groups in their study. The first group was intubated via direct laryngoscopy； in the second group， it was done with ILMA with immediate removal of the device. The third group was intubated via ILMA with delayed removal. They induced the patients with a titrated dose of propofol and 0.6 mg /kg of rocuronium. All three groups were found to have a similar magnitude of cardiovascular response to intubation. They also observed the second stress response in the third group.\n\n【39】Their findings did not approve the use of ILMA to decrease the cardiovascular response to intubation. M. Tabari et al. ， in their study， compared the stress response among 70 patients following intubation with ILMA and laryngoscopy. All the pa-tients got intravenous midazolam (40 mcg/kg/minutes) before intubation and were given Fentanyl 3-4ug /kg and 2 mg/kg of propofol and atracurium0.5 mg /kg. They found ILMA and DL Groups has similar hemodynamic response but MAP and DBP at the end of 5 minutes of intubation was significantly less in ILMA Group. We found a similar result in our study. In contrast to our finding， the study of Sener et al.  found increased stress response in the ILMA Group after intubation， and the likely reason suggested was applied force during intubation and increased time taken in hypertensive patients. Many studies have found decreased stress response following intubation with ILMA compared to intubation with laryngoscope . Abdel Fattah  conducted a similar study on hypertensive patients and found a significant increase in HR and MAP after laryn-goscopy and tracheal intubation till 3 minutes when compared with ILMA. We found statistically significant findings when only normotensive patients were compared but not in hypertensive patients. Another study which was done by Kihara et al.  in 2003 on 75 normotensive and 75 hypertensive patients where they compared hemodynamic response following the use of laryngoscope，lightwand and ILMA. They found that ILMA and lightwand attenuate the hemodynamic response following intu-bation in hypertensive patients but not in normotensive patients than the laryngoscope group. The findings of our study do not confirm it. In our study， ILMA failed to attenuate the statistically significant stress response in hypertensive patients.\n\n【40】S. H. Akhlagh et al.  compared both techniques of intuba-tion in patients undergoing CABG and observed that there were hemodynamic changes in both the groups， but stress response decreased earlier in the laryngoscopy group compared to the ILMA Group and explained that it could be due to a prolonged period of intubation in ILMA. But in our study， changes in stress response among hypertensive patients of both the groups re-mained comparable till 5 minutes and was not statistically sig-nificant.\n\n【41】The Pharyngolaryngeal morbidity in 24 hours was recorded in both the groups， and results were comparable with no statis-tical difference. The studies have noticed that using LMA over tracheal intubation reduced hoarseness and sore throat . It is considered that if the mask was to be inflated to the maximum recommended volume， there is a theoretical risk of ischemia of the pharyngeal mucosa. Kihara et al. study  observed that more mucosal injury was associated with ILMA due to the high pressures against the pharyngeal mucosa. Mucosal pressures over the range of the cuff volumes were seen to be， in general， lower for the LMA compared to higher values in ILMA. The study has shown that mucosal pressures were always greater than 157 cmH2O， where the posterior oropharyngeal wall was depressed by the curved metal tube . In contrast， the perfu-sion pressure of the posterior pharyngeal wall is 34 to 80 cmH2O.\n\n【42】Conclusion\n\n【43】Our study failed to demonstrate any benefit of using ILMA in hypertensive patients regarding the decrease in hemodynamic response， but in normotensive patients， there was a significant decrease in stress response. So it can be used in normotensive pa-tients as one of the alternatives. We also conclude that if patients are intubated in a deep plane of anaesthesia， then the trend of hemodynamic changes are similar in both the techniques， so ei-ther of these methods can be used for intubation. The incidence of Pharyngolaryngeal morbidity was also found to be the same with both instruments.\n\n【44】Limitations\n\n【45】1\\. More hypertensive patients could have been included in the sample size was large to get substantial results. Still， the cost of ILMA was a hindering factor as our institute could provide only limited ILMA.\n\n【46】2\\. It was a single-blind study as anaesthetic performing intu-bation couldn't be blinded.\n\n【47】3\\.

The diagnosis of PE may be challenging. as there can be a wide range of atypical presentationsCase Report： A 92-year-old man with asymptomatic first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block， hypertension that was con-trolled on medication， and a past medical history of deep venous thrombosis (DVT)， presented with dizziness， weakness， and collapse while getting dressed. On examination by the attending paramedics， he was noted to have sinus bradycardia at a rate of 18 bpm， which improved to 80 bpm after intravenous injection of atropine. An echocardiogram obtained in the emergency room (ER) showed a markedly dilated right ventricle (RV) with a hypokinetic RV free wall， preserved RV apical contractility， and septal wall motion abnormalities consistent with RV pressure overload. A ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan showed a massive PE involving more than 50%of the pulmonary vasculature. Urgent catheter-directed thrombolysis was performed， but the patient’s condi-tion deteriorated， and he died shortly afterward.\n\n【1】Conclusions：\n\n【2】Sinus bradycardia is an unusual initial presentation of PE， but the diagnosis should be considered in patients with multiple risk factors for thromboembolism.\n\n【3】MeSH Keywords： Bradycardia·Pulmonary Embolism·Thromboembolism\n\n【4】Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a relatively common medical emergency and is a life-threatening condition ， with a three-month mortality rate of up to 10% . While the symptoms of PE are often non-specific， the most common presentation in-cludes symptoms such as acute dyspnea， tachypnea， and hy-poxemia， as at least one of these symptoms is present in 92%of patients with PE .\n\n【5】Acute dyspnea is the most common presenting sign of PE， noted in approximately 50% of these patients. Tachycardia is another common presenting symptom of PE， noted in at least 25% of these patients. Furthermore， tachycardia is one of diagnostic criteria included in the Well's score， a validated tool for strat-ification of PE risk . However， PE may also present with atypical， non-specific symptoms including syncope， abdominal pain， cardiac arrhythmia， or seizure . The wide variation in presenting symptoms complicate ante-mortem PE diagnosis， with up to 84% of PE cases discovered only on autopsy .\n\n【6】This report is of an atypical presentation of PE in a 92-year-old man who presented with symptomatic bradycardia.\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】A 92-year-old man presented with first-degree atrioventricu-lar (AV) block. He had a history of hypertension that was con-trolled on medication， stroke， an asbestos-related lung disease with pleural calcification， rheumatoid arthritis， and deep ve-nous thrombosis (DVT)， three years before this presentation. His current medications included diltiazem 180 mg， and com-bined hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg) and triamterene (37.5mg) for hypertension， and clopidogrel (75 mg) for the prevention of secondary stroke.\n\n【9】Before his recent presenting event， the patient was in his usual state of health and was ambulatory， but with significantlyreduced mobility due to arthritis. On the morning of his pre-sentation to the hospital， the patient experienced dizziness and weakness while getting dressed， fell back on his bed，and slid down onto the floor. There was no loss of consciousness， no seizure activity， and no urinary or fecal incontinence. When the emergency services arrived， the patient was lethargic with a normal sinus rhythm of 18 beats/min and first-degree atrio ventricular (AV) block. After receiving two doses of intravenous atropine (0.5 mg)， his sinus rate increased to 80 beats/min.\n\n【10】During examination in the emergency room， the patient denied chest pain， shortness of breath， or cough. His blood pressure was 136/90 mmHg， his pulse rate was 73 beats per minute(bpm)， his respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute， and his oxygen saturation was 95% on breathing room air. His cardio-vascular， pulmonary， and neurological examinations were un-remarkable. There was no significant edema. Laboratory inves-tigations were notable for a leukocytosis of 11.6x10/L， serum creatinine of 1.5 mg/dl， troponin of 1.75 ng/mL， and pro-brain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) of 1829 pg/ml. An electrocardio-gram (ECG) showed sinus bradycardia of 48 bpm with first-de-gree AV block .\n\n【11】The patient was admitted to the hospital under the care of the internal medicine service and was placed under close observa-tion. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a dilated right ventricle (RV) with a hypokinetic free wall and preserved right RV apical function (McConnell's sign). The interventricu-lar septum was displaced towards the left ventricle，consistent with RV pressure overload. Given the patient’s previous history of DVT and findings consistent with acute RV strain， the pa-tient was further evaluated for PE. Computed tomography an-giography (CTA) was not undertaken due to renal impairment. However， a ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan was performed and showed a high probability of PE with the involvement of more than 50% of the pulmonary vasculature .\n\n【12】Duplex ultrasound examination of the lower extremities was performed to evaluate the source of the PE and showed acuteocclusion of the left common femoral vein. As systemic admin-istration of thrombolytic agents was contraindicated given the patient's age， history of multiple comorbidities and high risk of bleeding， the patient was started on a high dose infusion of unfractionated heparin and underwent catheter-directed thrombolysis. However， the patient's condition deteriorated due to progressive hypoxemia， and he died shortly afterward. Endotracheal intubation was not performed， as the patient had an advanced directive not to be resuscitated.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】This report is of an unusual case of acute submassive pulmo nary embolism (PE) presenting as symptomatic bradycardia. This patient lacked the typical signs and symptoms of PE. The definitive diagnostic evaluation for PE was undertaken after the discovery of a dilated right ventricle (RV) with evidence of RV strain and positive McConnell's sign. Despite not having pleu-ritic chest pain and shortness of breath， the patient suffered from reduced mobility and also had a history of treated deep venous thrombosis， both of which increased his risk of PE . The clinical risk of PE in this patient was intermediate，based on his Well’s score， but the findings from his ventilation/perfu-sion (V/Q) scan indicated that he had an 88% chance of having a PE . Computed tomography angiography (CTA) was not performed in his case， as the patient had renal impairment.\n\n【15】This case report highlights the importance of recognizing that PE may present with a wide spectrum of manifestations， which range from lack of symptoms to sudden death .\n\n【16】The diagnosis of acute PE continues to be difficult due to variability in the clinical picture at presentation. The atypi-cal presentations of PE， as reported in the literature， are pre-sented in Table 1.\n\n【17】Large cohort clinical studies have shown that sinus bradycar-dia may be present in more than 2% of patients with PE， and3.5% may have first-degree AV block at presentation . PE complicated by cardiogenic shock may present as syncope in 26% of patients . Patients with large， hemodynamically significant PE that results in syncope are expected to present with compensatory tachycardia . However， sinus tachy-cardia has been documented in only 30% of patients with an acute embolism of the pulmonary trunk and the main pulmo-nary arteries . It has been proposed that bradycardia in patients with PE may be related to vagal stimulation which lowers heart rate and causes concurrent atrioventricular (AV) block. It is presumed that RV dilation and pressure overload from PE lead to excess vagal stimulation . In the presented case report， bradycardia could also be a side effect of pro-longed treatment with diltiazem. However， this patient had never experienced symptomatic bradycardia prior to the de-velopment of PE， and his baseline asymptomatic first-degree AV block was unchanged. The management of patients with PE presenting with bradycardia is not well described. In one case report， symptomatic bradycardia resolved following theoph-ylline treatment . In this patient， symptomatic bradycar-dia resolved following intravenous administration of atropine.\n\n【18】Increased serum levels of troponin and pro-brain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) in patients with acute PE indicate RV strain and dysfunction and are associated with an increased risk of poor clinical outcome and increased mortality . The re-port of this case supports this association， as this patient had markedly raised serum levels of pro-BNP and troponin on hos-pital admission， and his echocardiogram showed severe right heart strain with impaired RV systolic function， which indicated a poor prognosis. These findings also altered the clinical man-agement， as increased serum levels of cardiac biomarkers and the presence of RV strain on transthoracic echocardiography(TTE) in patients with submassive PE are indications for fibrino-lysis， which can be administered systematically， or using cath-eter-directed thrombolysis， as in this case .\n\n【19】Conclusions\n\n【20】Pulmonary embolism (PE) presenting with sinus bradycardia is rare. However， PE should be considered in patients who have multiple risk factors for thromboembolism. Missing the diagnosis of PE can increase patient morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment interventions are required to improve clinical outcome in patients with acute PE.\n\n【21】Table 1.

{"seq_id": "950b72b1-3971-4b9f-a0a5-315577935580", "title": null, "text": "【0】Background：\n\n【1】Recent developments in surgical suture material include the use of sutures with unidirectional barbs that fa-cilitate laparoscopic suturing thanks to self-anchoring and tension-keeping properties. Complications deriving from the use of barbed sutures have been previously reported. In this report we present the case of a patient with gastric outlet obstruction by the free end of a V-Locm barbed suture (Medtronic， Dublin， Ireland) follow-ing Roux-en-Y gastric resection.\n\n【2】Case Report： In February 2023， a 77-year-old man who underwent laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy for cancer followed by Roux-en-Y reconstruction developed symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction a few days after discharge. The patient was readmitted to the hospital due to vomiting 4 days after being discharged after an uneventful post-operative course. Imaging confirmed the presence of an occlusion at the level of the jejunojejunal anastomo-sis， with a noticeable change in caliber. During laparoscopy， a loop of bowel was entrapped around the tail of the barbed suture used to close the common enterotomy of jejunojejunal anastomosis. Following laparoscop-ic division of the anchoring suture， the bowel regained its normal caliber.\n\n【3】Conclusions： Although complications from the use of unidirectional barbed surgical sutures are rare， this report highlights bowel obstruction as a recognized postoperative complication. The preferred treatment is laparoscopic division of the suture's tail. To prevent complications related to barbed sutures， it is essential to ensure that all barbs of the suture are properly unfolded.\n\n【4】Keywords： Gastrectomy· lleus·Laparoscopy· Suture Techniques\n\n【5】In laparoscopic surgery， intracorporeal suturing is one of the most important and difficult techniques， and mastering lap-aroscopic intra- or extracorporeal knotting can be achieved only with practice and patience . It is essential in advanced laparoscopy and is a rate-limiting step in many procedures. After the barbed sutures were demonstrated to be safe and efficient and a faster means of suturing， their use has been adopted by multiple surgical specialties involving laparoscop-ic stitching .\n\n【6】However， use of barbed sutures has been reported to be as-sociated with complications such as small bowel obstruction(SBO)， volvulus， ischemia， and perforation， mainly related to the exposed barbs at the suture’s tail . Among those com-plications， SBO is gaining recognition as a complication relat-ed to barbed sutures， with some documented cases and me-dian time of presentation of 8.5 days .\n\n【7】Barbed sutures are now widely used in upper gastrointestinal(UGl) surgery， and complications following their use have been reported for these procedures . Here， we present such a complication： SBO with gastric outlet syndrome caused by the free end of a V-Loc\" barbed suture (Medtronic， Dublin， Ireland) following Roux-en-Y gastric resection for cancer.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】In February 2023 a 77-year-old man underwent laparoscop-ic subtotal gastrectomy with D2 lymph nodes dissection for cT2N0 cancer of the gastric antrum， followed by Roux-en-Y reconstruction. The common enterotomies following the gas tro-enteric and the entero-enteric stapled anastomoses were sutured using V-Locm barbed sutures. Intraoperative methy lene-blue tests were negative for leaks and confirmed a good outflow from both anastomoses. The postoperative course was uneventful； following the negative hydro-soluble routine swal-low test on postoperative day 2， the patient was discharged on a soft diet 5 days after the operation .\n\n【10】The patient was readmitted 4 days after hospital discharge for multiple episodes of post-prandial biliary vomiting， nau-sea， and fatigue. A nasogastric tube was inserted and 700cc of biliary content aspirated. A computed tomography (CT) scan with soluble oral contrast revealed moderate distension of the gastric cuff and alimentary jejunal limb， with an evident change of caliber of the bowel at the level of the jejunojeju-nal anastomosis， and no evidence of anastomotic leakage or stenosis . A working diagnosis of SBO due to an in-ternal strangulated hernia or volvulus was made，and an ex-ploratory laparoscopy was undertaken.\n\n【11】Abdominal exploration revealed that the jejunum， a couple of centimeters from the anastomosis， was pinned and anchored by the barb of the tail of the suture used to complete the je-junojejunal anastomosis， creating a strangling girdle. There was no bowel necrosis or ischemia； the suture was divided and trimmed off the intestinal surface， and the intestine rap-idly regained its normal caliber .\n\n【12】The postoperative course was uneventful， and the patient was sent home on a soft diet after 2 days.\n\n【13】In all reported cases， and certainly in this one， the tail of the suture was left long and unburied. The recommended length of 2 cm maximum， suggested by the manufacturers， is prob-ably not universally known or maybe the suture is left long in purpose due to the perceived feeling of insecurity caused by the absence of the final knot to secure the suture . Clearly， to minimize the risk posed by the barbs of the suture， the mes-sage from the producers of barbed sutures should be reinforced； they suggest trimming the suture close to the exit from the approximated tissue or， in case of an anastomosis， to unfold the end of it by taking 1-2 bites back along the suture line.\n\n【14】From the time Kitano reported the first minimally invasive gas-trectomy in 1994， laparoscopic gastric resections have gained widespread acceptance in specialized centers . Indeed， as many other advanced laparoscopic procedures， it requires mastering technically demanding surgical steps， including su-turing and knotting.\n\n【15】In 1967 McKenzie reported the first use of barbed sutures， as opposed to smooth sutures， for the repair of long-flexor ten-dons， in vivo in dogs and in vitro in human cadavers . The first use of a barbed suture for tissue reapproximating in a laparoscopic myomectomy was reported in 2008 by Greenberg and Einarsson， and hundreds of thousands of operations em-ploy this technology .\n\n【16】Suturing and tying surgical knots in laparoscopy quickly and properly presents a novel challenge， and use of knotless barbed sutures can help in reapproximating tissues securely with less time， stress， and aggravation.\n\n【17】More specifically for gastrointestinal anastomosis， the non-infe-riority of barbed sutures compared to conventional smooth su-tures is well-established in the literature and some studies evenreported a reduction in rates of bleeding and leaking ， which is clearly very important because cutting barbs into su-tures may reduce the suture's tensile strength by weakening its core and narrowing its functional diameter. Although there is a growing body of evidence regarding the safety and effec-tiveness of the use of barbed sutures for knotless tissue con-trol， it is still important to report the potential specific compli-cations of barbed sutures to improve and correct the technique when using these sutures .\n\n【18】In the case herein reported， the tail of the suture was left un-folded， and the barbs pinned the jejunum， causing a strangling girdle， resulting in SBO. Twenty-five cases of SBO secondary to barbed sutures have been reported， mostly following laparo-scopic hernia repairs or gynecologic procedures. Only 3 cases occurred after a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y reconstruction： 2 fol-lowing a gastric by-pass for morbid obesity and 1 after a par-tial gastrectomy . Some differences in the present case are worth reporting： the timing of symptoms onset was much earlier than that described in the literature (9 vs 26 days) and the only symptom was vomiting with nausea； pain， which is the most frequent reported symptom (90%)， was complete-ly absent. As in half of the reported cases， an increase in the caliber of the small bowel was evident at imaging， suggest-ing a mechanical SBO， but the final diagnosis was made in-traoperatively .\n\n【19】After readmission， the working diagnosis was that of a gas-tric outlet syndrome possibly due to an internal hernia in the Petersen’s defect； the differential diagnosis included stricture， leakage， and adhesions.\n\n【20】Successful laparoscopic management has been reported in75% of cases， but 2 cases had ischemia of the strangled bow-el that required small-bowel resections. In the rest of the re-ported cased， the operation consisted exclusively of division of the suture， with immediate release of the entrapped bowel .\n\n【21】To avoid the tail of the suture disappearing into the bowel wall when it is divided off the serosa of the intestine， which can cause postoperative SBO， it can be anchored with 1 or 2clips .\n\n【22】Potential future directions for study of barbed sutures might include a suture with a different color when the barbs are ter-minated. Probably， the most important point is to raise the awareness of this potential complication. Specifically， small-bowel volvulus around the tail of a barbed suture should be considered in the differential diagnosis in cases of mechanical bowel occlusion following the use of these sutures. The pre-ferred treatment is laparoscopic division of the suture's tail. To prevent complications related to barbed sutures， it is essential to ensure that all barbs of the suture are properly unfolded.\n\n【23】Although complications from the use of unidirectional barbed surgical sutures are rare， this report has highlighted that bow-el obstruction is a recognized postoperative complication. The preferred treatment is laparoscopic division of the suture's tail. To prevent complications related to barbed sutures， it is es sential to ensure that all suture barbs are properly unfolded.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Primary HLH is an autosomal recessive disorder of childhood， with defects in cellular cytotoxicity. Secondary HLH is an ac-quired syndrome that presents in young adulthood secondary to a variety of inflammatory conditions： viral in-fections， rheumatologic conditions， or malignant processes. The inflammatory nature of certain conditions trig-gers a cytokine release in individuals who have abnormal T cell activation.\n\n【2】Case Report： A 30-year-old Hispanic male presented with worsening abdominal pain for 5 months and was found to have\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】fever， pancytopenia， and hypotension. Serial CT scans of the abdomen/ pelvis showed splenomegaly but no abscesses， areas of infection， or masses. Infectious causes were considered but results of all cultures and tests were negative except for a high Epstein-Barr viral load. The patient deteriorated and required intubation on hospital day 28. Repeat bone marrow biopsy on day 32 suggested a diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohis-tiocytosis， although there was no evidence of hemophagocytosis within the bone marrow. The patient contin-ued to deteriorate and was too unstable to receive treatment with chemotherapy He died on hospital day 34. This case highlights the importance of early consideration and treatment of secondary HLH in an individualpresenting with progressive fever， hepatomegaly and cytopenias.\n\n【5】Key words： EBV· EBV associated with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosisHemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare disorder， with both primary (familial) and secondary (acquired) forms. Secondary HLH most typically presents with fever， hepa-tosplenomegaly， and cytopenias. Other common manifesta-tions include hepatitis or acute liver failure， coagulopathies， bone marrow failure (including anemia or thrombocytopenia)， skin rashes (maculopapular rashes， petechiae，purpura)， or ev-idence of pulmonary dysfunction . HLH is commonly associ-ated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)， which most commonly oc-curs in immunocompetent individuals . In a recent study， EBV was the leading viral cause of secondary HLH .\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】A healthy 30-year-old Hispanic male was admitted to the hospital in April with complains of right lower quadrant abdominal pain with guarding and rebound tenderness associated with a few days of fevers and chills. On admission， the patient was found to be febrile (39.2℃)， hypotensive (95/55 mm Hg)， and tachy-cardic (124 bpm). An abdominal/pelvis CT showed a ruptured appendix with pericecal abscess and splenomegaly (19.7 cm). A complete blood cell count demonstrated mild pan-cytopenia and coagulopathy： white blood cell count， 4100/pL； hemoglobin level 12 g/dL； platelet count 126，000/pL； INR 2.3； prothrombin time 24.0； partial thromboplastin time 48.3. The patient was admitted and treated with intravenous antibiotics. after which he began to improve clinically and was discharged home on oral antibiotics.\n\n【8】Over the next 4 months， the patient was admitted 3 additional times with similar complaints of subjective fever and abdom-inal pain. During each admission， the patient was febrile， hy-potensive， tachycardic， pancytopenic， and coagulopathic. The patient was repeatedly treated with intravenous antibiotics. Due to his persistent splenomegaly， fevers， and pancytopenia， a hematology/oncology specialist was consulted， who recom-mended a bone marrow biopsy， which showed normochro-mic normocytic anemia， normocellular marrow， and no neo-plasia. The pancytopenia was thought to be infection-induced.\n\n【9】One month later， the patient was re-admitted to the hospital because of abdominal pain， nausea， vomiting， subjective fe-ver， and decrease oral intake for 5 days. An abdominal/pelvis CT scan showed a focal small bowel ileus in the right lower quadrant， and no abscess at this time. As part of the follow-up work-up， a right upper quadrant ultrasound was ordered， which showed cholelithiasis. Due to the patient’s history of working on a farm in Mexico， a number of lab tests were or-dered to rule infection， but results on PPD， cocci， histoplasmo-sis， and Cryptococcus were negative.\n\n【10】On hospital day 9， the patient became more tachycardic，hy-potensive， febrile， pancytopenic， and coagulopathic； there-fore， he was transferred to the intensive care unit for sep-sis. A complete blood cell count demonstrated： white blood cell count 1900/pL； absolute neutrophil count of 2，000；he-moglobin level 7.8 g/dL； platelet count 89，000/pL；peripher-al smear showed pancytopenia without blast cells； INR 1.6； prothrombin time 19.1； and partial thromboplastin time 43.2. He was transfused with packed red blood cells and multiple units of fresh frozen plasma， and was put on broad-spec-trum intravenous antibiotics. Blood cultures were sent (all negative) and tested for： CMV， HSV， HIV， and hepatitis pan-el were all negative， but EBV PCR came back positive， with54843copies.\n\n【11】The following day， he began complaining of right upper quad-rant pain. An ultrasound showed a thickening of the gallbladder wall， but HIDA scan was negative. In addition， the liver func-tion test result began to become markedly abnormal， with ALT121 U/L； AST 274 U/L； AP 374 U/L； total bilirubin 4.1 mg/dl； to-tal protein： 4.6 g/d； and albumin 1.8 g/dl. On physical exam， the patient became progressively more jaundiced and edema-tous. CT abdomen/pelvis， however， continued to show worsen-ing of the small bowl loop dilation， with air fluid levels (small bow. thickening vs. walled-off abscess). Gastroenterology was consulted and a colonoscopy with mucosal wall biopsies was done， which came back negative.\n\n【12】Over the next few days， the patient began to deteriorate and became more hypotensive and requiring vasopressors. As the patient became further pancytopenic and coagulopathic， he received multiple transfusions of fresh frozen plasma，plate-lets， and packed red blood cells. At this point， another bonemarrow biopsy was done. The peripheral aspirate showed normochromic normocytic anemia， rare nucleated red blood cells， marked leucopenia， and thrombocytopenia. Bone mar-row showed hypercellular bone marrow with erythroid hyper-plasia and decreased granulopoiesis， with no leukemic pro-cess identified.\n\n【13】The patient died the night before chemotherapy was to be initiated.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】The diagnosis of secondary HLH has been detailed in the HLH2004 protocol. According to the protocol， 1 of the following criteria should be satisfied ：\n\n【16】1\\. A molecular diagnosis consistent with HLH is made (Mutation of PRF1， UNC13D，Munc18-2，Rab27a，STX11，SH2D1A， BIRC4)\n\n【17】OR.\n\n【18】2\\. 5 of the 8 criteria shown below： fever >38.5； splenomegaly， cytopenias (HgB<9， Platelets <100x10°， neutrophils <1×10)； hypertriglyceridemia or hypofibrinogenemia； hemophagocy-tosis in bone marrow，spleen or lymph nodes； low or absent NK cell activity； ferritin >500 pg/L； elevated soluble CD25(a component of the IL2 receptor found on T-cells and that has been shown to be indicative of inflammatory states in individuals with HLH) .\n\n【19】Although the criteria above are a vital component of diag-nosis， analyzing peripheral blood smears and bone marrow biopsies should also show certain common features. It is important to analyze lymphocyte morphology. Individuals with HLH will typically exhibit proliferation of large granu-lar lymphocytes. Familial and EBV HLH variants will usual-ly show proliferation of mature or blastic-LGL， whereas HSV and adenovirus-HLH will typically show promonocytic cell proliferation .\n\n【20】Our patient fulfilled criteria for secondary HLH， including fever， splenomegaly， cytopenias and hypofibrinogenemia. His initial bone marrow biopsy， done on his first admission in April，re-vealed no evidence of malignancy or bone marrow pathology； however， a repeat bone marrow biopsy done on day 32 of ad-mission showed common findings of HLH. However， by the time he had developed the necessary clinical manifestations for di-agnosis， his condition had deteriorated immensely. Therefore， early consideration of HLH， despite initial noncontributory bone marrow biopsies and limited clinical symptoms， is vital.\n\n【21】The treatment options for HLH are quite diverse. Recent litera-ture strongly advocates treatment of the underlying inflamma-tory condition. The most widely accepted treatment regimen includes etoposide and dexamethasone. The HLH 94 proto-col states etoposide， dexamethasone， and Cyclosporine A are most effective. Recent studies have shown that the doses and frequency of this regimen may need to be adjusted based on disease severity and responsiveness. If no response is noted within 2-3 weeks， salvage therapy is recommended. In addi-tion， adjunct therapy includes controlling the inflammation. Rituximab has shown promise in controlling the underlying EBV. Similarly， alemtuzumab has been shown to be success-ful with suppressing T-cell activation. According to Freeman et al， survival is highest if started within 4 weeks of diagno-sis. However， even relapse rate was approximately 30% after 8weeks . Hematopoietic stem cell transplant has been shown to be useful in individuals with familial HLH， progressive disease， or brain involvement .

In most patients with hypothyroidism who develop rhabdomyolysis， precipitating factors， such as strenuous exercise or use of lipid-lowering drugs， can be identified.\n\n【2】Case Report： We report a case of a 52-year-old Hispanic woman with a history of hypothyroidism， hypertension， and type 2diabetes mellitus who presented with fatigue， severe generalized weakness， bilateral leg pain， and recurrent falls. She reported poor medication compliance for the preceding month. Initial laboratory testing showed ele-vated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and creatine kinase (CK) levels， indicating uncontrolled hypothyroid-ism with associated rhabdomyolysis. Supportive treatment with intravenous fluids and intravenous levothy-roxine were initiated and resulted in dramatic clinical improvement.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】We report a case of rhabdomyolysis， which is a rare but potentially serious complication of hypothyroidism. Screening for hypothyroid ism in patients with elevated muscle enzymes should be considered， since an early di-agnosis and prompt treatment of hypothyroidism is essential to prevent rhabdomyolysis and its consequences.\n\n【5】MeSH Keywords：\n\n【6】Hypocalcemia· Hypokalemia·Hypothyroidism· Methadone · Rhabdomyolysis·Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole CombinationAccording to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) ， hypothyroidism is found in 4.6% of the U.S. population， with 0.3% presenting clinically and 4.3% be ing subclinical . Clinical signs and symptoms of hypothy-roidism are often nonspecific， but muscular symptoms， in-cluding stiffness， myalgia， cramps， and fatigue are described by the majority of patients with clinical hypothyroidism . In patients with hypothyroidism， muscle enzymes may be el-evated ， but usually at levels less than ten times the upper limit of normal . However， rhabdomyolysis， the rapid break-down of skeletal muscle， due to hypothyroidism is rare  and in most of the reported cases， a precipitating factor has been identified， such as the use of lipid-lowering drugs ， or strenuous exercise . Rhabdomyolysis due to hypo-thyroidism， without an obvious precipitating factor， has been previously reported in the literature， but is very rare . We describe a case of a 52-year-old woman with a known di-agnosis of hypothyroidism and poor medication compliance， who presented with a new onset rhabdomyolysis.\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】A 52-year-old Hispanic woman with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus， hypertension， chronic hepatitis C，hy-pothyroidism， osteoarthritis， and opiate dependence present-ed to the emergency department with a three-day history of severe bilateral leg pain. She stated that she had run out of her medications about one month before presentation. She complained of fatigue， generalized weakness， headache， nau-sea， decreased appetite， numbness in her fingers， dry skin， and constipation for the few weeks before presentation， and she also reported dysuria and decreased urination for the preced-ing three days. She denied chest pain， shortness of breath， vomiting， or diarrhea， but had several recent falls that were not associated with syncope or major injury.\n\n【9】The patient was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism (Graves dis-ease) in childhood and underwent subtotal thyroidectomy when she was 12 years old. She had been on levothyroxine， calcium， and vitamin D supplements since her thyroidectomy. She was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus three years previously. The patient reported poor compliance with her home medications and glucose monitoring. She had com-pleted a ten-day course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a reported urinary tract infection a week before admission.\n\n【10】The patient had been smoking cigarettes， approximately one-quarter pack a day for the past 15 years， but did not drink al-cohol. She had a history of heroin dependence， and was on methadone， as prescribed by her ambulatory methadone clinic.\n\n【11】Her medications included aspirin 81 mg od， Metformin 1，000 mg bid， glipizide 10 mgod， atenolol 50 mgod， levothyroxine 100 mcg od， calcium gluconate 650 mg od， cholecalciferol 5，000 IU/day， methadone 60 mg od， gabapentin 200-400 mg/day， as need-ed， and Naprosyn 200 mg bid， as needed.\n\n【12】In the emergency department， physical examination showed elevated blood pressure of 186/105 mmHg， body tempera-ture of 36.4℃， respiratory rate of 16/min， and heart rate of76/min. Her weight was 122.2 kg with a body mass index(BMI) of 52.6 kg/m².\n\n【13】On admission， the patient was noted to be confused and lethar-gic， but responded to voice commands. She was noted to have a deep， hoarse voice，bilateral peri-orbital edema， and bilateral ex-ophthalmos.Mucous membranes were dry， and her tongue was normal. The abdomen was morbidly obese. Non-pitting edema in the bilateral upper and lower extremities was present， and several patchy areas of ecchymosis were present on the upper extremities. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable.\n\n【14】Laboratory data  showed findings suggestive of hypothy-roidism， hypocalcemia， and mild hypokalemia. The patient also had an elevated creatine kinase (CK) of 5，814 IU/L which sup-ported the clinical diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis. Urinalysis was normal. Electrocardiogram and chest X-ray were unremarkable.\n\n【15】Her elevated blood pressure improved after the administra-tion of metoprolol 50 mg orally， and improved pain control was achieved with the administration of hydrocodone and acetamin-ophen 10 mg and 325 mg orally， respectively. She was treated with intravenous (l) fluids and I calcium gluconate. The pa-tient was given a total of 1.5 liters of normal saline. The patient was also treated with levothyroxine 200 mcg Ⅳ daily for three consecutive days and then transitioned to oral levothyroxine125 mcg/day. Vitamin D was supplemented with oral calcitriol. Echocardiography showed moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal ejection fraction (60-65%) and no peri-cardial effusion. Potassium was replaced with I and then oral potassium chloride. Once appropriate therapy was initiated， the presenting symptoms improved significantly over the next several days， and by day 5， the CK level decreased to 2，349 IU/L The pa-tient was discharged home with instructions to continue her clin-ical follow-up with her primary care physician within two weeks.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Hypothyroidism is characterized by a broad spectrum of clini-cal findings， including muscular symptoms， but hypothyroid my-opathy is most often limited to myalgia， muscle stiffness， and cramps，and occasionally associated with mildly elevated levels of muscle enzymes .\n\n| Variable  | Reference range  | Day 1  | Day 2  | Day 3  | Day 4  | Day 5  | Day 6  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Glucose， random (mg/dL)  | 74-106  | 207  | 211  | 249  | 211  | 138  | 153  |\n| HgbA1c (%)  | 4.2-6.3  |  | 9.6  |  |  |  |  |\n| Serum sodium (mEq/L)  | 136-145  | 138  | 140  | 139  | 138  | 140  | 142  |\n| Serum potassium (mEq/L)  | 3.6-5.0  | 3.5  | 3.0  | 3.6  | 3.4  | 3.2  | 3.8  |\n| Anion Gap (mmol/L)  | 5.0-14.0  | 7  | 10  | 9  | 10  | 10  | 9  |\n| BUN (mg/dL)  | 7-18  | 16  | 14  | 13  | 15  | 15  | 24  |\n| Serum creatinine (mg/dL)  | 0.55-1.02  | 1.5  | 1.44  | 1.56  | 1.59  | 1.51  | 1.62  |\n| Calcium (mg/dL)  | 8.5-10.4  | 6.1  | 5.7  | 6.1  | 6.5  | 7.7  | 8.2  |\n| Phosphorus (mg/dL)  | 2.5-4.9  |  | 4.6  | 4.6  | 5.4  |  |  |\n| Parathyroid hormone (pg/mL)  | 14-64  |  | 2  |  |  |  |  |\n| Magnesium (mEq/L)  | 1.8-2.4  |  | 2.0  | 2.4  | 2.1  |  |  |\n| Albumin，serum (g/dL)  | 3.4-5.0  | 3.5  | 2.8  | 3.2  | 3.0  | 3.1  | 3.4  |\n| Alkaline phosphatase (U/L)  | 45-117  | 112  | 88  | 105  | 97  | 101  | 102  |\n| Alanine aminotransferase (U/L)  | 12-78  | 40  | 34  | 38  | 31  | 30  | 30  |\n| Aspartate aminotransferase (U/L)  | 15-37  | 71  | 60  | 61  | 45  | 37  | 38  |\n| Total bilirubin (mg/dL)  | 0.2-1.0  | 0.8  | 0.5  | 0.5  | 0.4  | 0.6  | 0.7  |\n| Thyroid stimulating hormone (mlU/L)  | 0.36-3.74  | 74.0  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Thyroxine (T4)， free (ng/dL)  | 0.76-1.46  | 0.20  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Triiodothyronine (T3)， total (ng/dL)  | 76-181  |  | 37  |  |  |  |  |\n| Creatine kinase (IU/L)  | 22-198  | 5814  |  | 4657  |  | 2349  |  |\n| Troponin I (POCT)  | Titer  | <0.05  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Total Cholesterol (mg/dL)  | 0-200  |  |  |  |  | 219  |  |\n| High-density lipoprotein (mg/dL)  | 40-60  |  |  |  |  | 35  |  |\n| Low-density lipoprotein (mg/dL)  | 0-100  |  |  |  |  | 152  |  |\n| Triglyceride (mg/dL)  | 30-150  |  |  |  |  | 295  |  |\n| AM Cortisol (mcg/dL)  | 4.0-22.0  |  |  |  |  | 32.1  |  |\n| Total 25-hydroxy vitamin D (ng/mL)  | 30-100  |  | 34  |  |  |  |  |\n| Hemoglobin (g/dL)  | 12-15.3  | 11.8  | 11.3  |  |  |  |  |\n\n【19】Day 1 is the first day of admission at our hospital. The symptoms of rhabdomyolysis commenced three days before Day 1.\n\n【20】Rhabdomyolysis is characterized by skeletal muscle necrosis and release of intracellular muscle constituents into the cir-culation . Some of the known causes of rhabdomyolysis include vigorous exercise， inflammatory myopathies (polymy-ositis)， congenital deficiency of muscular enzymes， trauma， infection， electrolyte disorders (hyponatremia， hypokalemia， hypocalcemia)， hyperosmolar states， medications including statins， and toxins， including alcohol .\n\n【21】Rhabdomyolysis， the rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle，may also develop due to hypothyroidism . Myolysis in hypothyroidism is caused by changes in muscle fibers from fast-twitching type ll to slow-twitching type-l fibers， deposi-tion of glycosaminoglycan， poor contractility of actin-myosin units， low myosin ATPase activity， and low ATP turnover in the skeletal muscles . With hypothyroidism，there is an inhibi-tion of mitochondrial activity in muscle cells as well as dysreg-ulation of many metabolic pathways such as Krebs cycle， fatty acid catabolism and glycolytic energy production . Thesemetabolic abnormalities may sensitize patients with hypothy roidism to develop rhabdomyolysis， especially in the presence of other factors that may provoke the development of myopathy.\n\n【22】The patient described in this case report had not taken her usual thyroid medication for about a month before admission， and showed both clinical and laboratory findings of hypothy-roidism . The patient presented with extreme fatigue， peri-orbital edema， non-pitting edema in the extremities， dry skin， constipation， as well as low free thyroxine (T4)， high thy-roid stimulating hormone (TSH)， and hyperlipidemia. The diag-nosis of rhabdomyolysis was based on the findings of severe myalgia， muscle weakness， and marked elevation of creatinine kinase (CK) levels (a 30-fold elevation). Muscular symptoms with mild to moderate elevation in CK levels are common find-ings in patients with hypothyroidism ， but only in a very small proportion of these patients will muscular involvement progress to the point of developing overt rhabdomyolysis .\n\n【23】Most patients with hypothyroidism who develop rhabdomy-olysis are found to have a clear precipitating risk factor， such as the use of lipid-lowering drugs  or strenuous exer-cise ， but none of these risk factors were present in this case. As this case has shown， rhabdomyolysis may also develop due to hypothyroidism alone ， but this is rare. Rhabdomyolysis caused by severe hypothyroidism alone has also been reported in the pediatric age group . Clinical awareness of this rare complication of hypothyroidism may modify clinical management and screening tests for hypothy-roidism， for example， before starting statin therapy . Also， hypothyroidism should be considered as a possible etiology in patients presenting with acute renal failure and elevated muscle enzymes after initiating statin therapy .\n\n【24】Review of the literature for hypothyroidism-induced rhabdo-myolysis is summarized in Table 2. The differential diagnosis for the development of rhabdomyolysis， in this case， is also summarized as follows.\n\n【25】Hypokalemia： The patient presented with mild hypokale-mia， with a serum potassium of 3.5 mEq/L (reference range：3.6-5.0 mEq/L) on admission. After administration of Ⅳ flu-ids and subcutaneous insulin， the potassium level further de-clined to 3.0 mEq/L， which prompted administration of lVpo-tassium chloride. The serum potassium levels then improved to 3.6 mEq/L， and fluctuated between 3.2-3.8 mEq/L  in the following days.\n\n【26】Profound hypokalemia with serum potassium levels of less than 2.5 mEq/L may cause rhabdomyolysis by reducing blood flow to the muscles in response to exertion . Hypokalemia is also associated with severe muscle weakness and pain in the setting of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) ， and ina reported case of TTP， myopathy progressed to the develop-ment of rhabdomyolysis . In our case， the patient had only mild hypokalemia . Therefore， it is unlikely that hypo-kalemia played a significant role in the development of rhab-domyolysis in this patient.\n\n【27】Hypocalcemia： The patient presented with a serum calcium of 6.1 mg/dL (normal range： 8.5-10.4). The corrected calcium level， given the low albumin in this case， was still low at 6.5mg/dL. Hypocalcemia is associated with rhabdomyolysis， but is considered to be a result of rhabdomyolysis rather than a cause . In a study on traumatic crush injuries， hypo-calcemia was found in all the patients with rhabdomyolysis .\n\n【28】There have been several case reports in which hypocalcemia has been considered as the possible cause of rhabdomyolysis， but the mechanism of hypocalcemia-induced rhabdomyolysis is not well understood . In a case report by Akmal ， he reports a case of rhabdomyolysis in a patient with hypo-parathyroidism whose calcium was as low as 4.1 mg/dL. In two other cases， reported by Hower et al.， the calcium levels were also as low as 4.4 and 3.8 mg/dL In another case of hy-poparathyroidism presenting with rhabdomyolysis， reported by Sumnu et al.， the serum calcium level was 3.7 mg/dL . According to this review of the literature， the corrected calci-um level of 6.5 mg/dL， as shown in our patient， was unlikely to have been the cause of rhabdomyolysis.\n\n【29】Mechanical injury： The patient reported several uncomplicat-ed falls before admission. Although mechanical injury is re-ported to cause elevated CK levels，most rhabdomyolysis cases are related to crush injuries . We believe that the history of falls in this patient was probably related to her fatigue and generalized weakness due to her untreated hypothyroidism.\n\n【30】Methadone： There are a few published case reports of rhab-domyolysis following methadone use . It has been proposed that methadone may increase muscle demand for oxygen， and subsequently augment the state of muscle isch-emia . The patient was not taking methadone in the last few days before her presentation to the hospital. After admis-sion， methadone was restarted with the dose of 30 mg a day， but rhabdomyolysis continued to improve with the treatment of her hypothyroidism despite methadone use.\n\n【31】Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole： There have been severalre-ports of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-induced rhabdomyol-ysis in immunocompromised patients ， but it seems to be very rare in the immunocompetent patients. To our knowl-edge， only two cases of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-in-duced rhabdomyolysis have been reported in immunocompe-tent patients .\n\n【32】Table 2.

One reported case had a previous diagnosis of subclinical hyperthyroidism and was taking propylthiouracil. In the five remaining cases， thyroid disease was not previously diagnosed. In this review，In our patient， severe hypothyroidism was likely the principal etiology of rhabdomyolysis. It is also possible that patients with hypothyroidism have increased susceptibility to developing rhab-domyolysis. The presence of other risk factors for rhabdomy-olysis， including the well-known risk factors such as strenuous exercise and statin use， or weakly associated risk factors， such as methadone use， may help to precipitate rhabdomyolysis.\n\n【35】hypothyroidism-induced rhabdomyolysis appeared to be more common in males (80%)， despite hypothyroidism being more common in women. In six of the cases， no precipitating risk factors for rhabdomyolysis were reported .\n\n【36】Clinicians should be aware of the potential risk of hypothy-roidism-induced rhabdomyolysis， as further investigation of other precipitating risk factors could be beneficial. By identi-fying these risk factors， clinicians can avoid， for example， the use of statins or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole that may pre-dispose patients with hypothyroidism to the development of rhabdomyolysis.\n\n【37】Muscular symptoms are mentioned by the majority of the pa-tients with frank hypothyroidism and can be the predominant or the only clinical manifestation of hypothyroidism . According to the clinical guidelines of American Thyroid Association ， finding an elevated serum concentration of one or both of the muscle enzymes， CK and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH)， that per-sist for at least two weeks， is enough to justify the request of serum TSH assay in order to confirm or exclude hypothy-roidism .\n\n【38】Furthermore，healthcare provider awareness of rhabdomyoly-sis as a rare complication of hypothyroidism， and explorationof other possible risk factors of rhabdomyolysis may help pro-vide a more timely diagnosis and treatment for these patients. Hypothyroidism is a common and usually easily treatable dis-ease， but learning more about its different manifestations and complications can significantly improve the care of patients， and deserves consideration.\n\n【39】Conclusions\n\n【40】This case report describes a patient suffering from rhabdo-myolysis related to severe hypothyroidism. Rhabdomyolysis is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of hy-pothyroidism that can occur in patients with poor medica-tion compliance， as illustrated by our case report. Therefore， early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of hypothyroidism are essential. Screening for hypothyroidism in patients with elevated muscle enzymes， as recommended by the American Thyroid Association ， may detect pre-existing subclinical hypothyroidism and subsequently lead to more timely treat-ment of hypothyroidism and prevention of its complications.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The main ofour report was to determine the cause of obesity irtwo patients who suffered ofessential arterial hypertension (EAH).\n\n【1】Case report： The patients with severe EAH and obesity received an omental transplantation of the left and rightanterior perforated space， respectively. Neurological examination of the first patient was normal， whereas thelast case had a lacune in the right putamen and a small ischemic infarct in the posterior limb of the internalcapsule. In both of them patients EAH was normalized after surgery and without antihypertensive medica-tion.Moreover， they presented loss of body weight and without no food restriction.\n\n【2】Conclusions： These clinical results indicate that ischemic neurons in the posterior hypothalamic nuclei areresponsibles ofneurogenic hypertension， and the ischemia in the lateral hypothalamic zones is related with obe-sity. By contrast to this， its revascularization can normalize or improve both diseases.\n\n【3】BACKGROUND\n\n【4】Obesity is the result of an accumulation of fat， which is stored as adipose tissue. The association of obesity with serious disorders such essential arterial hyper-tension (EAH)， diabetes mellitus， and cerebrovascu-lar and cardiovascular diseases， are frequents.\n\n【5】This report describe two patients with essential hypertension and obesity who received transplants of omental tissue on the anterior perforated space(APS) to treat the severe EAH . However， the loss of weight in late postoperative and without they have a food regimen regimen was an unexpected finding for us， which should be analysed.\n\n【6】CASE REPORTS\n\n【7】Case l\n\n【8】This44-vear-old woman\n\n【9】Was\n\n【10】admitted to the Hospital with a 16-year history of EAH  and an increased food intake since 13 years before her admission.During these years her blood pressure va-ried between 160/110 and 230/130 mm Hg in spite of to receive quinapril (20 mg per day)， enalapril (30mmg per day) and nifedipine 10 to 20 mg per week， among other antihypertensive drugs. Besides this， she had a strict food regimen， especially a diet with vey little sodium. Her parents died of stroke after\n\n【11】EAH\n\n【12】Examination\n\n【13】On physical examination， the patient’s appearance was appropriate for her age， obese (1.58 m of height and 87 Kg of body weight)， lucid and her arterial pressure was 210/120 mm Hg.Her neurological eval-uation was normal. Blood glucose was 100 mg/100ml， total cholesterol 255 mg/100 ml and creatinin 1.2mg/100 ml. A brain computarized tomography (CT) scans showed slight atrophy in the anterior media portion in both temporal lobes.\n\n【14】Operation\n\n【15】With the diagnosis of severe EAH ， an omental transplantation on the left APS was performed on November 22， 2000， without immediate complica-tions. The method employed was described in previ-ous publicacionts . During the surgery we found：1) a small aneurysm with its origin just distal to the middle cerebral artery bifurcation； 2) moderate ath-erosclerosis in the supraclinoid portion of the inter-nal carotid artery， and 3) absence of the left posteri-or communicating artery.\n\n【16】Postoperative course\n\n【17】After the first postoperative days， her arterial pres-sure varied between 140/90 and 160/100 mm Hg and she received 5 to 10 mg of quinapril per day and 1mg of clonazepam at night during 5 months. Subsequently she received only 2 mg of clonazepam at night. At present， 31 months after the operation， her mean blood pressure is 120/85 mm Hg and does not require antihypertensive medication.\n\n【18】Moreover， after surgery and to date， the patient has maintained a diet normal without no food restriction. but a decreased food intake. However， in spite of this new food habit， she had gradual loss of body weight， in particular visceral obesity， as at the present time her weight is 68 Kg. That is， 31 months postoperative， she has a loss of weight in about 22 percent.\n\n【19】Case 2\n\n【20】This 43-year-old man was admitted to the Hospital on May 12， 1998， with diagnosis of a small hemorrhage in the left putamen and arterial hypertension .The only relevant previous history was increased food intake since 10 years before his admission.Three years later， he presented another stroke after EAH. He received captopril or enalapril and nifedipine， as well as a dietetic regimen. His mother died of intracranial hemorrhage after EAH.\n\n【21】Examination\n\n【22】The patient was fully conscious， in wheelchair， obese(1.65 m of stature and 93 Kg of body weight) and his arterial pressure was 210/110 mm Hg. Blood glucose was 112/100 ml and total cholesterol 232 mg/100 ml. Neurological examination revealed slight motor dys-phasia，lleftihemihypesthesiaandhemiparesis(degree， 0-2)， as well as crural right Monoparesis(degree， 4). A brain CT scans showed a lacune in theright putamen and another small ischemic infarct in the posterior limb of the left internal capsule.\n\n【23】Operation\n\n【24】An omental transplantation on the right APS was performed on January 2002， without complications. The surgical technique and the findings were described in a previous publication .\n\n【25】Postoperative course\n\n【26】His arterial pressure as normalized since the first postoperative days and without antihypertensive medication.Likewise there were neurological impro vement to the point of to walk and work. Moreover，6 months after surgery he presented a loss of body weight in about 12 Kg， i.e， 13 percent and without no food restriction. The reduction of the abdominal obesity was evident.\n\n【27】DISCUSSION\n\n【28】Neurological improvement of cerebrovascular seque lae (case 2) and normalization of EAH observed in both of them clinical cases after omental implanta tion， it confirm experiences previous obtained in another patients with cerebrovascular diseases  and in patients with stroke after EAH . In gener al， these results demonstrated that the function of neurons and/or axons in the residual nervous tissue in ischemia and ischemic penumbra can improve if circulation is restituted by means of omentum， and later on， because of neuronal regneration .\n\n【29】Thus， based on surgical experiences in 7 patients with EAH， we have demonstrated that the revascu larization of the lateral and posterior hypothalamus provokes normalization of neurogenic hypertension(main representative of EAH). Because the local ischemia in the posterior hypothalamic nuclei and surrounding structures are related with neurogenic hypertension 1-3，13.\n\n【30】For a long time we know that the electrical stimula tion in the lateral and posterior hypothalamic zones， especially the perifornical area， can produce an increase in blood pressure， in appetite (hyperphagia) and in the release of adrenocorticotropin hormone(ACTH) . Then， an ischemic lesion in these hypothalamic zones may evoke a similar response by a stimulative action on the neurons. For these rea-sons we postulate that the loss of weight in our twc patients reported here were due to： 1) revasculariza tion of neurons related with the appetite increased； 2)inhibition or supression exerted by leptin  and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT 1)  on neu-rons in the lateral hypothalamic area；3) a decreased food intake， and 4) a progressive regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis； beause， in contrast to this， dysfunction of this axis may elevate the levels of circulating cortisol， which is implicated in the development of visceral obesity .\n\n【31】Therefore， based on the above-mentioned factors and weight loss observed in our patients， we think that decreased food intake was caused by functional recovery of ischemic neurons in the lateral hypothal-amic zones. Moreover， these patients also confirms that the ischemia in the lateral and posterior hypo-thalamic zones are the main responsibles of neuro-genic hypertension through two pathways ：A principal， constituted by posterior hypothalamic nuclei， spinal cord and the juxtaglomerular appara-tus， and other accesory， integrated by paraventricu-lar， lateral and posterior nuclei of the hypothalamus， the pituitary gland and adrenal cortex.\n\n【32】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【33】These clinical results suggest that the overweight and obesity are related with a local ischemia in the lateral hypothalamic zones. Likewise we believe that this hypothalamic dysfunction is linked one way primary with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\n【34】1\\.

Giant BCC only accounts for 0.5% of BCCs and super giant BCC is exceedingly rare. On account of their rarity， there are no established guidelines for GBCC treatment.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】We describe a peculiar case of an 82-year-old woman with a GBCC carcinoma of the lower abdominal wall. The tumor was surgically removed with ipsilateral inguinal lymph nodes and the abdominal wall was reconstruct-ed immediately with a pedicled deep inferior epigastric artery perforator (DIEP) flap.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】Treatment of giant basal cell carcinoma is often difficult， especially in elderly patients with poor general health and multiple pathologies. The pedicled DIEP flap is rotated to cover the loss of substance without tension， and it is easy to harvest and transfer. This flap allowed a good result without local or systemic complication. We present this report as a reminder of the occasional occurrence of extremely aggressive BCCs. We believe that， especially for rare tumors like these， it is very useful for the entire scientific community to publish these cas-es and the therapeutic strategies used to treat them.\n\n【6】MeSH Keywords： Basal Cell Carcinoma · Giant Basal Cell Carcinoma · Perforator Flap · Propeller FlapSome histological subtypes are more aggressive (such as mor-pheaform， micronodular， and metatypical) and have been as-sociated with a worse evolution. Metastasis by BCC is rare； the incidence of metastases is estimated to be around 0.1%. As defined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)， when BCC reaches 5 cm in diameter， it is called giant basal cell carcinoma (GBCC) or super giant basal cell carcinoma if it has a diameter larger than 20 cm. Giant BCC only accounts for 0.5% of BCCs and super giant BCC is exceedingly rare. Less than 1% of all BCCs reach this size .\n\n【7】These tumors typically have slow growth and are almost as-ymptomatic for many years until they begin to impair quality of life， causing pain， severe anemia， hypoproteinemia due to con-tinuous blood and exudate loss， serious infection， and sepsis.\n\n【8】Giant basalioma， unlike the smaller BCCs， is a rare skin malig-nancy characterized by aggressive behavior， the tendency to infiltrate deep tissues (e.g.， bands， muscles， and bones)， and to metastasize. For this reason， these tumors have a poor prog-nosis. Tumors greater than 5 cm in diameter have a 25%inci-dence of metastasis .\n\n【9】Because of the rarity of these tumors in the literature，there is no large case series of GBBCs. It is therefore difficult to draw conclusions about clinical presentation， histological features， prognostic factors， or treatment strategies from the few clin ical cases described.\n\n【10】A literature review suggests that giant BCC typically affects men in their sixties with a history of slow-growing tumor for at least 15 years. Risk factors for the development of giant BCC include delayed presentation， patient neglect， recurrence af-ter previous treatment， aggressive histological subtypes (mor-pheaform， micronodular， and metatypical)， or a history of ra-diation exposure 4.\n\n【11】Even for giant basal cell carcinoma， the primary cause should be exposure to ultraviolet radiation but the onset in areas not exposed to the sun seems to contradict this statement. It may also occur in patients with basal cell nevus syndromes， xeroder-ma pigmentosum， albinism， immunodepression， chronic ulcers， or a history of exposure to arsenic， tar derivatives， or x-rays.\n\n【12】On account of their rarity， there are no established guide-lines for GBCCtreatment. Wide local excision with tumor-freemargins (histologically) is the criterion standard of treatment， but recurrence or metastasis developed in 30-40% of patients， often despite adjuvant radio- and chemotherapy . We de-scribe a peculiar case of an 82-year-old woman with a GBCC carcinoma of the lower abdominal wall. She did not present specific risk factors that favored or induced the onset of this tumor. The tumor was surgically removed and the abdominal wall was reconstructed immediately with a pedicled DIEP flap.\n\n【13】Case Report\n\n【14】An 82-year-old woman presented with an enormous abdom-inal wall mass， 15 cm in diameter ， which had ap-peared on healthy skin about 20 years before and that the pa-tient had never shown to anyone in her family. Following an accidental fall， the patient had reported a femur fracture for which she was admitted to the Orthopedic Department. At the time of the visit， the orthopedist noted at the left hypochondria a verrucous， ulcerated， and fetid mass causing severe meta-bolic alterations. Blood tests showed neutrophil leukocytosis， anemia (Hb 7 gr/dl)， and severe hypoproteinemia. A CT scan demonstrated an infiltration of the abdominal wall， the mus-cular fascia but not the underling muscles， without inguinal nodes evolving. No metastases were identified.\n\n【15】Before surgery， blood transfusions were administered untilthe Hb reached 9 gr/dl. Three days before the surgery， a microbio-logical test was performed on the tumor， daily boric acid solu-tions were applied to the mass， and systemic antibiotic thera-py (amoxicillin and clavulanic acid， 2.2 gr) was administered. Under general anesthesia， the patient was operated on. Wide and radical local excision with 2.5-cm peripheral margins in-cluding the fascia was performed . The superficial inguinal lymphadenectomy was performed in continuity with the tumor. Histologic diagnosis was nodular basal cell carci-noma， with partial adenoid-cystic and scleroderma-like as-pects， extensively ulcerated， associated with intense inflam-matory infiltrate in the dermis. Ten inguinal lymph nodes were free from neoplastic infiltration. The margins were tumor-free.\n\n【16】The loss of substance was covered using a pedicled DIEP flap， muscle sparing， harvested on the right deep inferior epigas-tric artery . Using Dopplerimaging， a dominant per-forator was identified close to the defect. The flap was isolat-ed on a perforator of the medial row of the right deep inferior epigastric artery. Through an incision of the fascia， the perfo-rator was dissected to its origin from the main vessel， which was dissected distally to the right inguinal region. The na-vel was incised and isolated. The upper abdominal skin areas were detached from the fascial plane for about 10 cm proxi-mally in order to favor the skin closure. The navel was trans-posed and sutured higherThe DIEP flap was raised as a pedicled propeller flap， rotated180 degrees， and placed in the recipient site. The long pedicle of the flap was placed with particular attention to the abdom-inal muscular fascia， without tension or torsion and without any risk of compression. The muscular fascia was closed and reinforced through a continuous suture and the flap was easily located at the recipient site. The donor site was closed direct-ly. The surgery lasted 3 hours. This considerably reduced the general risks associated with prolonged narcosis. No hernia or bulging occurred after 3 months， and there were no signs of recurrences or metastasis after 6-month follow-up . We present this report as a reminder of the occasional occur-rence of extremely aggressive BCCs.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】Giant BCCs greater than 10 cm in diameter are exceedingly rare. BCC is a slow-growing tumor ； it grows on average1 mm in diameter per year . It can then potentially grow to reach large dimensions and infiltrate deep (extradermal) tissues.\n\n【19】Metastasis are extremely rare and reported in less than 0.1% of cases， but the rates of metastasis and mortality increase with increasing tumor size. Tumors greater than 5 cm in diameterhave a 25% incidence of metastasis. Tumors greater than 10cm in diameter are associated with an approximately 50% in-creased risk of metastases and death. The prognosis of met-astatic BCC is therefore extremely poor . The percentage of GBCC metastases reported in the literature is unclear， with wide ranges reported. The rate of metastasis for BCC ranges from 0.003% to 0.55%.According to some authors， the overall incidence of BCC metastases is 0.03% .The metastatic rate rises to 1.9% for BCCs greater than 3 cm， to 45% for lesions greater than 10 cm， and 100% for tumors greater than 25 cm.\n\n【20】The most frequent site of metastases are lymph nodes (40-83%) lung， bone， skin， and liver. Metastases occur manly in males(with a male/female ratio of 2：1). Average survival with me-tastasis is 8-14 months . Our literature review found only a few cases . BCCs are usually located on the head and neck (80%)， and 10% occur on the trunk. These big lesions are most commonly found on areas covered by clothing and typically expand because of ongoing neglect by the patient.\n\n【21】Treatment is often difficult， especially in elderly patients with poor general health and multiple pathologies. As for any ep-ithelioma， surgery is the treatment of choice. As described in the literature， alternative treatments are less effective. Radiotherapy can be useful as adjuvant therapy to control re-currence. Targeted therapy with the hedgehog pathway in-hibitor vismodegib shows good results in neoadjuvant treatment for advanced or metastatic GBCC， especially in el-derly or inoperable patients.\n\n【22】Tumors of the abdominal wall can be treated with a wide local excision but reconstruction can be very complicated. Lesions larger than 5 cm in diameter require clinical free margins of20-30 mm (or more) because GBBCs have higher incidence of subclinical extension and the risk of tumor recurrence is68%. Many surgeons prefer to carry out delayed reconstruc-tion， waiting for histological examination to confirm the ab-sence of tumor on excision margins. According to the litera-ture， skin grafts and free flaps (latissimus dorsi， ALT， and TFL free flap) are the main surgical techniques for covering the de-fect， both in delayed and immediate reconstructions . We described a typical case of an elderly woman with a GBCC subjected to radical removal of the lesion and to an immedi-ate reconstruction with a pedicled DIEP flap based on the con-tralateral deep inferior epigastric artery.\n\n【23】While its use in free tissue transfer has been widely report-ed， its use as a local pedicled flap has been more rarely de-scribed. In the literature， few reports describe use of the DIEP flap for hip， vulvar， or groin defects reconstruction and there are 2 reports of abdominal wall reconstruction .\n\n【24】The DIEP flap is rotated 180 degrees， as a propeller flap， to cover the loss of substance without tension. The benefits of this technique include， as for all propeller perforator flaps， the avoidance of muscle sacrifice (lower donor site morbidity)，the ease of harvest and transfer， and the ability to avoid complica-tions associated with microanastomosis. Another advantage is the plasticity in flap design (\"freestyle\"). The rapidity of the technique is extremely important， especially in older and co-morbid patients， where a prolonged general anesthesia could compromise general health conditions. However， in our pa-tient， the presence of a fracture of the left femoral bone， ho-molateral to the tumor， led to the exclusion of the use of oth-er flaps (e.g.， ALT， TFL， VL) taken from the thigh. Instead， we used the pedicle DIEP flap， which limited the donor-site mor-bidity to the abdominal region alone， which was the same as the reconstructed site. The pedicled DIEP flap achieved a good result without local or systemic complications.\n\n【25】The postoperative period was regular and uneventful. The pa-tient， during her 6 months of oncological follow-up， did not show signs (either clinical or instrumental) of recurrence or metastatic disease.\n\n【26】Conclusions\n\n【27】We described a case of GBCC in an elderly woman subject-ed to surgical radical removal of the lesion and to an imme-diate reconstruction with a pedicled deep inferior epigastric artery perforator (DIEP) flap， based on the contralateral deep inferior epigastric artery.

Cognitive Impartment is non-motoric symptoms and rare manifestation during acute phase stroke. Report： We report a patient with Ischemic stroke with family's to complain of sudden onset recent memory loss， confusing and headache. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) showed moderate cognitive impairment. Computed tomography scan (CT-scan) of his brain showed temporoparietal infark. Patient with high-level haematocrit. He was treated with aspilets and haemodilution. The patient was symptomatically better after 6 hours. Conclusion： Stroke ischemic acute with high haematocrit， with isovolemic haemodilution blood-HES， exchanged therapy gives a good outcome in cognitive function.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Cognitive impairment， acute phase stroke， haemodilution\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Stroke is a medical emergency in neurology. Early neurological deterioration or death occurs in 24 hours. Clinical manifestation of stroke may vary depending on the vascular lesion. Hyperten-sion， diabetic， dyslipidemia， hematocrit level are the significant risk in stroke. Hematocrit is essential to rule in blood viscosity and the proportion by volume. Its considered with haemoglobin， white blood cell， and platelet count. Hematite level influences cerebral blood flow by poor arterial oxygen delivery and corre-lates inversely. Cognitive impairment is affected by vascular pathology in the brain. 10 % of Patients with cognitive impair-ment occurred before the first stroke attack. There are limitedpublished data on the use of haemodilution in the treatment of VCI in high-level haematocrit.\n\n【4】Case presentation\n\n【5】A 72 years old male presented to Public General Hospital Sanglah Denpasar， Bali. Informed consent was received from the patient involved in this case study. He had complained sud-den onset recent memory loss， confusing and headache of 29hours duration. Informed consent was received from the pa-tient involved in this case study. He has diagnosed with stroke non-haemorrhagic thrombus and was on the drug (antiplatelet aggregation aspilet and citicoline). On physical examination， blood pressure 140/80 mmHg， he was in disorientation， confu-sion， headache (NPRS =3). The meningeal sign is negative， no motoric weakness， no cranial nerves palsy， absent pathological reflex. Cognitive screening tool with MMSE shown moderate cognitive impairment (score 13).\n\n【6】Laboratory investigation showed 16.54 g/dL， total white blood cell count 7.30x109/L， platelet count 310x109/L， haema-tocrit 53.94%. Serum electrolytes， blood sugar， renal and liver function test were normal. Chest X-ray is normal. Computed tomography scan of the brain showed subacute infark left tem-poroparietal region .\n\n【7】The patients were treated with single haemodilution isov-\n\n【8】olemic with the blood-HES exchange of 350 ml in the emergency neurology department. The antiplatelet drug was given 320mg followed by 80 mg daily. His symptoms gradually better within12 hours of admission. The hematocrit level 46% decrease after haemodilution. The MMSE improved to mild cognitive impair-ment(score 23). After five days， patients were discharged from hospital in an ambulatory state. He was advised to continue the antiplatelet drug.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Stroke is non-infection disease occurred in older adults with dys-function of the brain due to cerebral blood flow impairment. Ras， age； gender is an unmodified risk factor. The primary clinical features of stroke are hemiparesis， speech disturbances， hemianopsia， hemihypesthesia， and cranial nerve palsies.\n\n【11】In this case， VCI occurs in the acute phase of stroke. This is very different from the research conducted by Lisa Mellon et al.， who found that 50% of VCI patients occur after stroke in 6months. Research conducted by Jia Hao Sun et al. found VCI patients to occur within three months after stroke. The un-derlying mechanism is by a study conducted by Jia Hao Sun et al. That infarct volume was associated with> 100 ml VCI events causing dementia.The presence of lesions in the frontal cortex， limbic area and white matter decreases half of the variability in MMSE counting. The limbic system area includes hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex. Lesions in the right hippocampus will cause persistent long-term memory impairment， while in-farction in the left hippocampus， impact nonverbal long-term memory. Dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus are associated with the incidence of hippocampal atrophy in the male popu-lation. The study conducted by Gemmel et al. investigation of the post mortem hippocampus in post-stroke dementia patients. The volume of neurons is 10-20% smaller in the CA1 and CA2areas， 20% smaller than the CA3 and CA4 areas. Li et al. Also found blockages in the cerebral artery media in animal model related to the incidence of post-stroke VCI through the mecha-nism of increasing levels of GABAergic neurotransmitters and decreasing extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) extracel-lular regulation. Decreasing ERK function causes failure of hydrogen sulfide donors which are a neurotransmitter to inhibit damage neurons hippocampally.\n\n【12】In this case， using isovolemia hemodilution with Hydrox-yethyl Strach (HES) replacement fluid according to the volume of blood taken 350ml exchange with HES. We choose HES because it does not impair kidney function， but the most signifi-cant advantage is disrupted platelet function. The mechanism that explains HES inhibits platelet function through\"platelet-linking von Willebrand factor， decreases the amount of fibrino-gen， thrombin generation， and reduce platelet-fibrinogen surface receptor (glycoprotein IId and Ia).\n\n【13】Blood flow velocity in cerebral arteries undergoes improve-ment in tissue perfusion due to a decrease in hematocrit from53.39% to 46% normal levels and the effect of HES to inhibition of thrombus formation. Clinical changes in patients are char-acterized by the discovery of improved cognitive function by scoring MMSE 13 to 23. \n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】Stroke ischemic acute with high haematocrit， with isovolemic haemodilution blood-HES， exchanged therapy gives a good out-come in cognitive function.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It is subclassified into 2 en-tities： the extension type， which is predominantly seen， and the flexion type. It can be further classified into 4types according to the Gartland classification， which assesses the anatomical severity of the fracture depend-ing on the lateral radiographs of the elbow and operative findings. The usual mechanism of injury is falling on outstretched hands.\n\n【2】Case Report： This study presents a rare case of high radial nerve palsy seen in an 8-year-old previously healthy male patient after closed reduction and percutaneous pinning of a Gartland type lV supracondylar fracture using 2 lateral diverging pins and 1 medial crossing pin. Several attempts of forceful maneuvers were needed to anatomically reduce the fracture. X-rays and contrasted CT scan were done after the surgery confirming proper placement of pins and intact vascularity. However， a CT scan revealed a large hematoma in the posterior compartment of the arm and subcutaneous edema with soft-tissue swelling at the left elbow. A conservative management plan was established with serial physical examination and follow-up for the next 3-6 months. Subsequently， the pa-tient experienced dramatic improvement of nerve function over 6 weeks following the surgery， and complete recovery of radial nerve motor and sensory function was achieved 2 months after the operation.\n\n【3】Conclusions： Most nerve injuries are a neuropraxic nerve injuries， which resolve spontaneously without intervention. Physicians usually reserve any surgical intervention in case of progressive worsening of neurological deficit or if no im-provement occurs in 3-6 months.\n\n【4】Keywords： Humeral Fractures · Radial Nerve ·Remission， Spontaneous\n\n【5】Supracondylar fracture is one of the most common pediat-ric traumatic fractures. It accounts for 13% of all pediatric fractures and 60% of upper-limb fractures among children in the first decade of life， with peak incidence at age 5-7 years. Supracondylar fractures are subclassified into 2 entities： ex-tension and flexion fractures. Extension type accounts for 98%of supracondylar fractures， which usually occurs when children fall on an outstretched hand with extension of the elbow try-ing to protect themselves from falling. The flexion type gen-erally accounts for less than 2% of supracondylar fractures. This fracture is further classified into 4 types according to the Gartland classification，which assesses the anatomical severity of the fracture depending on the lateral radiographs of the el-bow and operative findings： type l (non-displaced)， type ll(par-tially displaced with intact posterior cortex)， type III (displaced with disrupted posterior cortex but the periosteal hinge is in-tact)， and type lV (complete periosteal disruption with insta-bility in flexion and extension). Type l mostly diagnosed with examination under anesthesia during surgery .\n\n【6】Supracondylar fractures are likely to be associated with neu-rologic and vascular injuries， accounting for 15-20% and 15%of all supracondylar fractures， respectively， in which anteri-or interosseous nerve  and brachial artery  injuries are the most commonly injured structures. Other complica-tions (eg， compartment syndrome) may co-manifest， like， butcompartment syndrome is a very rare complication and occurs in less than 1% of this type of fracture .\n\n【7】Here， we present a rare case of high radial nerve palsy after closed reduction and percutaneous pinning of a Gartland typeⅣ supracondylar fracture.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A previously healthy 8-year-old boy presented to our Emergency Department as a referral from a tertiary hospital after falling down on outstretched hands， complaining of left elbow pain， and inability to move the joint for 4 h. On examination； the patient was in a backslab cast with 45 degrees flexion. The backslab cast was removed， revealing severe swelling and gross deformity of the left elbow. However， there were no open wounds， the neurovascular system was intact， and there was good hand perfusion， with capillary refill within 2 s.\n\n【10】X-ray imaging  revealed a supracondylar fracture of extension type. The patient was admitted to the hospital， closed reduction and percutaneous pinning was performed 8 h later. After surgery， we classified the fracture as Gartland type Ⅳ. Vigorous reduction maneuvers were attempted， and the frac-ture was fixed with 2 lateral diverging pins and 1 medial cross-ing pin. An X-ray was taken postoperatively . In the recovery room， the patient had intact neurological features，intact distal pulses， and good hand perfusion， with no imme-diate complications. The morning after the surgery， a physical examination showed intact distal pulses with good hand per-fusion. However， the patient could not abduct or extend his left thumb. A weak index finger extension and wrist drop was noted， with loss of sensation over the dorsum of the hand， dorsum of the forearm， and dorsoradial aspect of the thumb. A contrast CT was ordered  to ensure the proper placement of the K wires and to detect any potential vascular injury. The CT scan showed accurate placement of the 3 pins and intact vascularity， and also revealed a large he-matoma in the posterior compartment of the arm and subcu-taneous edema， with soft-tissue swellings at the left elbow. The management plan was to follow up the patient by doing serial physical examinations for early detection any signs of compartment syndrome and to observe the evolution of the neurological function. The patient was hospitalized for 4 days， then followed up in the out-patient clinic weekly for 1 month； no medication or nerve nutrients were given to the patients. During the inpatient stay， the nerve function showed no im-provement. One month after the surgery， pins were removed in the clinic . The wrist extension was completely re-covered， while thumb abduction and extension did not show any improvement. There was some recovery of sensory func-tion， more notable over the dorsum of the forearm. Six weeksafter the surgery， the thumb extension and abduction were fully recovered with return of sensation over the dorsum of the hand and dorsoradial thumb. He was able to extend the index finger 2 months after the surgery .\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Radial nerve injury is a common complication following hu-merus fractures， particularly those involving the distal end of the humerus， supracondylar， and the shaft. The literature re-ports radial nerve injury to be the most common nerve inju-ry associated with supracondylar fractures . The most re-cent literature reports anterior interosseous nerve injury to be the most common neurological injury (34%) associated with the extension-type supracondylar fracture and the ulnar nerve(91%) in the flexion type. In addition to traumatic injuries，iat-rogenic injuries that occur during treatment have been report-ed and are estimated to account to 3-6% of the neurological injuries associated with these types of fractures .\n\n【13】The radial nerve receives branches from all nerve roots from C5-T1 and exits the axilla as a terminal branch of the posteri-or cord of the brachial plexus. When it leaves the axilla， it has a sensory branch to the posterior arm and branches that in-nervate long and medial heads ofthe triceps. The radial nerve travels from medial to lateral direction within the spiral groove of the humerus. This location makes the nerve susceptible to injury when humeral shaft fractures occur， especially when itis associated with traction and angulation forces. At the spiral groove the radial nerve branches into the inferior lateral cu-taneous nerve of the arm and the posterior cutaneous nerve of the forearm， and branches to lateral and medial heads of the triceps and the anconeus muscles. The radial nerve has branches to the brachioradialis and extensor carpi radialis longus as it pierces the lateral intermuscular septum， 7.5-10cm above the lateral epicondyle of the humerus after it exits the spiral grooves. Knowledge of the anatomy is essential to identify the level of the injury； injury of the nerve at the axil-la is usually associated with proximal sensory loss and weak-ness of elbow extension. The radial nerve gives innervation to the triceps as it exits the axilla and the elbow extension is usually spared in supracondylar fractures and humeral shaft fractures. From 86% to 100% of the injuries are neuropraxic and usually resolve spontaneously within 3 to 6 months af-ter the injury. Although axonotmesis and nerve laceration are rare sequelae， a few reports have confirmed their association with this type of fracture .\n\n【14】Nerve injuries associated with supracondylar fractures usual-ly occur due to nerve tenting or entrapment within the sharp proximal bone fragment， while iatrogenic injury occurs due to excessive traction and manipulation of the bone during closed reduction or as a complication of wire insertion， especially when the medial wire is inserted， or as a direct injury during open surgery . latrogenic injury associated with closed reduction and percutaneous spinning usually affects the ulnar nerve， as the greatest risk is with K wire cross-fixation. Themini-open approach for a medial wire usually decreases the risk of ulnar nerve injury. Some cases have been reported of median and radial nerve injuries associated with lateral k wire insertion； most of the cases retain full nerve function with the removal of the wire and with a conservative approach. In our case， the patient had a normal neurological examina-tion before the closed reduction and percutaneous pinning， but on the morning after the surgery， he developed a wrist drop and with loss of sensory function proximally， indicating high radial nerve injury at the level of the spiral groove. After this finding， we ordered contrasted CT scan and AP and later-al X-rays to reassure the proper location of the wires and to assess vascularity. The CT scan revealed a large intramuscular hematoma. Due to the proximal involvement of the nerve，we excluded the direct injury of the nerve by the bone fragments. Also， the patient had a good pulse and good hand perfusion with very mild pain， so compartment syndrome was exclud-ed. After the CT findings， we were hesitant to perform surgi-cal exploration and possible hematoma evacuation， but since the risk of surgery exceeds the risk of expectant management， a decision was made to follow up the patient for the next 3-6months， as it was most probably a neuropraxic injury. If im-provement did not meet expectations or was halted/arrest-ed， then nerve conduction study and surgical exploration of the nerve were to be planned. Previous studies have agreed on a similar approach to the one applied in this case . Electrodiagnostic studies along with history and physical ex-amination usually guide the management plans for periph-eral nerve injuries. Electrodiagnostic studies can differenti-ate high-grade nerve injury (neurotmesis and axonotmesis) from low-grade injury (neuropraxia). Nerve conduction and electromyography are affected by a variety of factors； there fore， there is often no precise information about the site of nerve involvement， and its usefulness in the acute setting inmaking a decision for conservative or surgical management is questionable. Often， a trial of conservative management is instituted， and if there are no signs of recovery on follow-up examination and electrodiagnostic studies， surgery is indicat-ed . According to Pulos et al， in the management of iat-rogenic nerve injuries， initial electrodiagnostic examination is indicated 3 to 4 weeks after the surgery if the neurologi-cal deficit continues and there are no signs of recovery .\n\n【15】Our patient regained full function of the nerve 2 months af-ter surgery. Based on this， we concluded that either the vigor-ous reduction maneuvers during the surgery or the large he-matoma or both had exerted a traumatic level of tension on the radial nerve， and this probably was responsible for the re-sultant injury.\n\n【16】Conclusions\n\n【17】Based on the findings of this case study， it can be concluded that， although radial nerve injury occurs in the setting of supra-condylar fractures， it is less frequently seen following surgical treatment. In addition， neuropraxia is still the most common type of nerve injury encountered， which can be attributed to compressive or tensile traumatic forces applied on the nerve or to both forces， as seen in our case. Most neuropraxic nerve injuries resolve spontaneously without intervention， as report-ed in this case. We usually only perform surgery when there is progressive worsening neurological deficit or if no improve-ment occurs in 3 to 6 months.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

However， the approach to Amyand's henia involving a noniflamed appendix is still controversial.\n\n【6】Key words： Amyand's hernia· appendicitis\n\n【7】The finding of the appendix inside the hernia sac is designed in the literature as Amyand’s hernia since Claudius Amyand’s first description of this condition in 1735 . This is a rare entity constituting 1% of all the inguinal hernias. Less common finding is an acute appendicitis inside the hernia sac .\n\n【8】In this paper， we aimed to report a patient with Amyand's hernia and to review the literature.\n\n【9】CASE REPORT\n\n【10】A 54-year- old male visited our outpatient clinic with a swelling and pain in his right groin. The tenderness was present for one year but the symptoms became worst during the last 3 weeks. Physical examination revealed a non-tender， reducible swelling in the right inguinal region. No sing of intestinal obstruction was found. Digital rectal examination was normal. The patient’s personal history was unremarkable and he had no his-tory of previous surgical operations. His WBC count was 13800/mm. Other laboratory test results as well as plain films of abdomen were normal.\n\n【11】Surgical operation was planned with the preoperati-ve diagnosis of right indirect inguinal hernia. After2 gram first generation cephalosporins was given for prophylaxis spinal anaesthesia administered and an incision was made in the skin crease of right inguinal region. The deep fascia was opened and external ob-lique aponeurosis identified and parted to reveal the spermatic cord. After then hernia sac was identified and isolated all around. On opening the hernial sac， the appendix was found to be lying within. Neither adhesions nor inflamation were found. So， we didn’t remove appendix. Instead， we repaired hernia with tension-free hernioplasty after reducing the appendix into the abdominal cavity. After the operation we used neither antibiotic nor wound drainage.\n\n【12】.\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n\n【14】An external hernia is an abnormal protrusion of intraab-dominal tissue through a fascial defect in the abdominal wall. About 75% of hernias occur in the inguinal region and hernial sac may contain different intraabdominal organs such as omentum and small bowel. The bladder， a Meckel's diverticulum (Littre’s hernia)， or a portion of antimesenteric wall of small intestine (Richter’s hernia) can also be encountered as unusual contents. The last two of the above are well-known even by their eponyms in standard textbooks and teaching practice. Amyand's hernia remains relatively unknown dispite having been first reported nearly 270 years ago.\n\n【15】The term Amyand's hernia refers to the presence of the appendix within the hernia sac. The incidence of having a normal appendix within an inguinal hernia sac is about 1%， whereas only 0.1% of all cases of ap-pendicitis present in an inguinal hernia  Solecki et al observed that acute appendicitis was found in 0.62%of groin hernia sac . Gurer et al has reported that appendix was found in 0.51 %，and acute appendicitis was found in 0.1 % of groin hernia sac .\n\n【16】Amyand hernia usually occurs on the right side， probably as a consequence of normal anatomic posi-tion of the appendix. On the other hand， right-sided inguinal hernias are more common than left-side inguinal hernias. However， Amyand's hernia has also been reported located on the left side which may be associated with situs inversus， intestinal malrotation or mobile caecum .\n\n【17】The pathophysiology of Amyand’s hernia still con-troversial. The reason of inflamation of the appendix in the incarcerated or sliding inguinal herni may be because of the incarceration itself. The obstruction of the mesoappendix may occur because of the eleva-tion of intraabdominal pressure due to abdominal muscle spasms or the adhesions in chronic hernia. This will cause abnormal bacterial colonization in the appendix and subsequently acute appendicitis may occur . In our case， since we did not observe an inflamed appendix in the hernia sac， we did not perform appendectomy.\n\n【18】It is not easy to make a clinical diagnosis of an Amyand’s hernia preoperatively. In most of the ca-ses， it is considered as an incarcereted hernia and so operated in emergency. At laparotomy， an appendix is identified when the hernia sac is opened. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen may be helpful for making the correct diagnosis. If the diagno-sis established by CT it is possible to treated Amyand’s hernia with laparroscopically . But it is not our rou-tine practice to subject the patient to CT after making a diagnosis of a complicated hernia . In our case the diagnosis was made intraoperatively.\n\n【19】The treatment of hernial appendicitis is appendec tomy through the herniotomy with primary hernia repair through the same incision . However， the approach to Amyand's henia involving a noniflamed appendix is controversial. Priego et al. consider that even when the appendix has no gross inflammation signs， apendectomy should be performed in all cases， since surgery is not more complicated and， even in the absence of macroscopic inflamation， the presence of microscopic inflamation from compression and ischemia within the hernia sac cannot be ruled out.\n\n【20】On the other hand， the risk of wound infection and subsequent recurrence of the hernia remain a cause of concern if the appendix is removed . Therefore， some authors suggest that the presence of a normal appendix does not require appendectomy . We agree with the latter quoted statement， and we did not perform appendectomy in our case， since the appendix appeared macroscopically normal within the hernia sac.\n\n【21】The use of mesh for hernia repair in a contaminated wound is open for debate. It is generally accepted that mesh should not be used in the repair of conta-minated abdominal wall defects， because prosthetic material can increase the inflammatory response and result in an increased incidence of wound infection and possible appendiceal stump fistula . Therefore， Logan et al， and Solecki et al. reported that they did not use mesh in their cases who had gangreneous appendicitis， instead they performed conventional herniorrhaphy. Priego et al， studied 6 cases of in-carcerated crural hernia with vermiform appendix inside. In all cases they performed appendectomy performed via the hernia sac. They used mesh in three cases. Postoperative course of five of their cases was eventful， but one patient developed wound infection in whom a prostetic material was used. However， Saggar et al.， reported that they used a mesh in theircase with a right-sided incarcerated inguinal hernia hernia without any untoward sequele. In their case there was no peritonitis. They stated that the use of mesh would not have been prudent if the appendix had been gangreneous or there had been peritonitis. With wound drainage and judicious use of antibiotics they did not observe any postoperative complications related wth the prosthetic material used. Associated intra-abdominal abscesses， if present， may be dealt with， either percutaneously or by open drainage . In our case a normal appendix was found within the hernia sac. No inflamation or sign of peritonitis were existed. So we did not hesitate to repair hernia with tension-free hernioplasty after reducing the appendix into the abdominal cavity.\n\n【22】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【23】In conclusion Amyand's hernia is a rare entity which is hard to diagnose preoperatively. The diagnosis mostly depends on clinical judgement， and should be considered in elderly patients presenting with an incarcerated or strangulated hernia. Mostly diagnosis can only be made during the operation. Treatment involves appendoctomy through the herniotomy with hernia repair. However， the approach to Amyand's henia involving a noniflamed appendix is still con-troversial.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Mandibular fracture， fracture of the jaw， is a breakthrough the mandibular bone. Mandible fracture is among the most fre-quently encountered injuries in the trauma centre setting and demonstrate the second most commonly fractured bone in the fa-cial skeleton next to nasal bone fracture . The high incidence of mandibular condyle fracture is attributed to the binding of the mandibular ramus with high stiffness and mandibular condylehead with low stiffness . Mandibular fracture， especially in the condyle area can be considered as a defence mechanism that prevents severe traumatic transmission to sensitive upper areas， such as the brain and skull . The type of mandibular fracture depends on several factors such as amount， side and direction of force， muscle reaction and the resistance of the jaw bone in different sites. The most important types of mandibular fractures include fractures of symphysis， parasymphysis，body， the angle of the mandible， ramus， condyle and the coronoid process of the mandible . Treatment of fractures in this area can be performed open or closed reduction . The used treat-ment methods usually depend on the experience of the surgeon， the availability of internal fixation devices， the type of fracture， the patient age and so on. Nowadays， open reduction is the first choice in the treatment of fractures in this site. When open reduction and internal fixation is chosen as treatment， the use of miniplates has acceptable results. Besides， the use of screw and plate in the treatment of prognathism or retrognathism surgeryof mandibular is more acceptable and has more favourable ther-apeutic results . Dental-skeletal malocclusions， in addition to the problems of beauty and sometimes social and psychologi-cal complications， are often associated with functional disorders. Despite the great efforts of many specialists to treat patients with prognathism or retrognathism of mandibular， Ultimately， a large number of these people will need surgery . Functional abnormalities， the feeling of need for more magnificent beauty， increased risk of periodontal disease following dental malocclu-sion， pain and other temporomandibular joint disorders caused by malocclusion are the factors that cause the referral of patients for orthognathic surgery . Generally， the proper design of the screw and plate placement relative to each other in order to prevent the driving the screw out of the bone， maintain the integrity of the screw-plate and create a more robust system in order to improve the plate function are essential in the treatment of fractures or abnormalities surgery of mandibular bone using screw and plate. In this case， even if the bones under the plate are decayed， the fixation should remain intact . As regards， no study so far has been done about the change in the angle of monocortical screw placement relative to the miniplates in these surgeries； the aim of this study is the investigation of the effect of the angle of monocortical screw placement in the miniplate stability in created fractures of sheep mandibular bone.\n\n【4】Material and Methods\n\n【5】In this experimental study， three fixation systems including mini-plate and three angles of monocortical screw (45， 60， and 90°) were evaluated that fixed on mandibular sheep bone. The mini plates were four holes with a thickness of 1 mm and a length of28 mm (Synthes Company， Switzerland). The thickness of and the length of screws (Synthes Company， Switzerland) were 2mm and 8 mm， respectively. Thirty hemi-mandibles were cut from the mandibular angle with surgical saws and handpiece， and two pieces of bone were again fixed to the same position with a mini plate and in each sample with one of three angles of monocortical screw (45， 60， and 90°) relative to mini plates. Afterwards， mandibles were fixed on special clips in the univer-sal testing machine (SANTAM Company， Iran) that is used for tensile and shear tests. To investigate the fixation system， the first loading of each jaw was started and continuously increased to the extent that the displacement of the section of cut pieces started and the amount of force entered was recorded. Statistical data analyses were performed via SPSS software and expressed as mean ± SD. The ANOVA test was used when comparing multiple samples. A p-value <0.05 was considered significant.\n\n【6】Results\n\n【7】The mean of tolerated tensile forces is presented in table 1 and figure1. The results of ANOVA test showed that there was a significant difference between the angle of monocortical screw in terms of the mean of tolerated tensile forces statistically (p=0.001). The results of Post Hoc test (Tukey HSD) demonstrated(table2) that there was a significant difference between the mean tolerated tensile forces at the angle of 45 and 60 degrees (p =0.004) and the angle of 45 and 90 degrees (p =0.001). On the other hand， there was not a significant difference between the mean tolerated tensile forces at the angle of 60 and 90 degrees (p=0.742).\n\n【8】The shear force did not affect the angle of monocortical screws placement. In other words， before breaking the screws at the considered angles， plates bending was occurred .\n\n【9】Table 1 The mean of tolerated tensile forces in three angles of monocortical screw (45， 60， and 90 degrees) relative to mini plates.\n\n| Degree  | Mean  | SD  | Min  | Max  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 45  | 111.76  | 23.046  | 91.3  | 148.1  |\n| 60  | 280.02  | 75.48  | 200  | 370  |\n| 90  | 311.14  | 82.88  | 200  | 400  |\n\n【11】Table 2 The results of Tukey HSD the investigated groups.\\*：mean of differences in two group were significant at 0.05 level.\n\n| Group  | Mean  | SE  | CI(95%)  |  | p-Value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Group  | Mean  | SE  | UP  | LL  | p-Value  |\n| 45 vs 60°  | \\-168.26\\*  | 41.79  | \\-56.77  | \\-279.75  | 0.004  |\n| 45 vs 90°  | 199.38\\*  | 41.79  | \\-87.89  | \\-310.87  | 0.001  |\n| 60 vs 90°  | \\-31.12  | 41.79  | 80.37  | \\-142.61  | 0.74  |\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Generally， the proper design of the screw and plate placement relative to each other in order to prevent the driving the screw out of the bone， maintain the integrity of the screw-plate and create a more robust system in order to improve the plate func-tion are important in the treatment of fractures or abnormali-ties surgery of mandibular bone using screw and plate. In this case， even if the bones under the plate are decayed， the fixation should remain intact . In different studies， the amount of fixation stability with different patterns has been investigated in mandibular bone surgery ， but no study so far has been done about the change in the angle of monocortical screw placement relative to the miniplates in these surgeries. The aim of current study was the investigation of the effect of the angle of monocortical screw placement in the miniplate stability in created fractures of sheep mandibular bone. The present study was a laboratory study and the evaluation of tensile and shear forces on mini-plate systems at different angles of the screw was done practically on a simulated sample. Since that， the most similar cortical bone and bone density of the lower jaw of hu-man are observed in sheep. Therefore， the evaluation of this system was performed on the sheep mandibular bone . Foley et al. investigated several different fixation techniques in terms of tensile force. In two groups was used from three bicortical screws placed at 60 and 90 degrees to the surface of the bone in an inverted L pattern with two screws on the superior border. The equal force， which is equivalent to biting force in the area of the mandibular first molar， was introduced to the specimens. No significant difference in transverse strength was demonstrated between bicortical screws placed at 60 degrees to the bone surface and those placed at 90 degrees to the bone surface in the same pattern . Olivera et al. investigatedthree stable internal fixation techniques in sagittal osteotomy of the mandibular ramus (SOMR). The study was performed in 30 sheep hemi-mandibles randomly divided into three ex-perimental groups. The samples were subjected to SOMR. In group I， 2.0x12 mm screws was used for fixation， inserted in an inverted \"L\" pattern. In group I， fixation was performed with two 2.0x12 mm screws， positioned in a linear pattern and a 4-hole straight miniplate and four 2.0x6.0 mm monocortical screws (hybrid group). In group II， fixation was performed with two 4-hole straight miniplates and eight 2.0x6.0 mm mono-cortical screws (mini plate group). The hemimandibles were subjected to vertical linear load test by Kratos K2000MP me-chanical testing unit for loading registration and displacement. All groups showed similar resistance during mechanical test for loading and displacement， with no statistically significant differences between groups. These results demonstrate that the three techniques of fixation are equally effective for clinical fixa-tion of SOMR . Brasileiro et al. evaluated the biomechanical features of three different methods of rigid internal fixation for sagittal split ramus osteotomy for mandibular setback in vitro. Sixty polyurethane replicas of human hemimandibles were used as substrates， simulating a 5-mm setback surgery by sagittal split ramus osteotomy. These replicas served to reproduce 3different techniques of fixation， including 1) a 4-hole plate and4 monocortical screws (miniplate group)，2) a 4-hole plate and4 monocortical screws with 1 additional bicortical positional screw (hybrid group)， and 3)3 bicortical positional screws in a traditional inverted-L pattern (inverted-L group). After fixation， hemimandibles were adapted to test support and subjected to lateral-torsional forces on the buccal molar surface and verti-cal cantilever loading on the incisal edge with an Instron 4411mechanical testing unit. Peak loadings at 1， 3， 5， and 10 mm of displacement were recorded. Regardless of the amount of displacement and direction of force， the miniplate group always showed the lowest load peak scores compared with the other fixation techniques. The hybrid group showed behaviour simi-lar to the inverted-L group in lateral and vertical forces at any loading displacement. Molar load tests required more force than incisal load tests to promote the same displacement in the mandibular setback model. For mandibular setback surgery of 5mm， this study concluded that the fixation technique based on the miniplate group was significantly less rigid than the fixation observed in the hybrid and inverted-L groups . Our result was in contrast with Uckan et al. that compared the biomechani-cal stability of 60 degrees and 90 degrees angles for insertion of screws for fixation of sagittal split ramus osteotomies in 10 sheep mandibles in vitro. The osteotomies were fixed with screws 2mm in diameter at either 60 degrees or 90 degrees to the long axis of bone. All specimens were then loaded physiologically and the load-displacement of the osteotomies was recorded. There was no significant difference between the groups . Accord-ing to other studies， the placement of the screw in the direction perpendicular to the location of the osteotomy is desirable. From a geometric point of view， the screw that is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of osteotomy exhibit the highest displacement resistance. The Screws that are placed in the 60-degree direction have contact with a higher level of cortical bone， and this factor can compensate the theoretical defect screw placement with a60-degree angle to the long axis of the osteotomy . Sato et al. evaluated the resistance and tension areas created after load incidence in different varieties of sagittal split ramus osteotomy fixation techniques. Fifty synthetic polyurethane hemimandiblereplicas were subjected to linear loading tests to evaluate four fixation techniques of the sagittal split ramus osteotomy us-ing 2-mm system plates and screws. The hemimandibles were fixed with three 90 degrees linear screws， three 60 degrees lin-ear screws， three screws in a reversed L arrangement， and one titanium miniplate. Each group was subjected to linear loading using an Instron 4411 servohydraulic mechanical testing unit. The load peak value and peak displacement were measured. Another four hemimandible replicas were made of photoelastic resin and subjected to photoelastic analysis after linear loading with a 3-mm displacement. The results of the mechanical tests showed statistically significant differences between the fixation groups. The linear 90 degrees fixation and the reversed L ar-rangement presented with greater loading resistance， followed by the linear 60 degrees fixation and miniplates. Concerning the stress distribution in the photoelastic analysis， the fringes were concentrated near the osteotomy and to the lower part of the mandible in the linear 90 degrees-screw system and reversed L arrangement. In the case of the linear 60 degrees screws， most fringes were located around and between the screws. In the case of the miniplates， the fringes were concentrated around the screws near the osteotomy and more distally . According to the geometry and mandibular bone cortex thickness， the ad-vantages of linear placement of screws with a 60 degree angle are the possibility of intrabuccal insertion， preventing possible damage to neurovascular structures and reducing surgical time.\n\n【15】The maximum of tolerated tensile force was related to the angle of 90 degrees of the screw， and the least was the angle of 45degrees of screw. There was a significant difference between the mean tolerated tensile forces at the angle of 45 and 60 degrees (p= 0.004) and the angle of 45 and 90 degrees (p=0.001). On the other hand， there was not a significant difference between the mean tolerated tensile forces at the angle of 60 and 90 degrees(p=0.742). The findings demonstrated that the shear force did not affect the angle of monocortical screws placement. In other words， before breaking the screws at the considered angles， plates bending was occurred. Since there were no significant differences between the angles of 60 and 90 degrees of the screw in terms of mean tolerated tensile force， it seems that in cases where the surgeon faces with limited access during surgery he can use a 60-degree screw angle. Due to the reduction in chewing power after the mandible fracture and the surgery and the fixation of the fracture lines by the mini plates， the best angle between the screw and the plate will be the angle that resists to the forces of at least 120-200 N after the operation . Therefore， according to the results obtained from this study， the angle of 45degrees between the screw and the plate has a mean tolerated tensile force of 111.76±23.046 which is less than the minimum resistance that should be against this force， so is not suitable. In theory， it can be concluded that in a clinical setting in which good bone contact and desirable displacement exist and the area is slightly affected by soft tissue surrounding， both techniques can be used. However， in cases where immediate mandibular function is more critical， such as a patient that has a massive masticatory muscle， the usage from a fixation plan with more rigidity should be considered， such as a 90-degree screw plan25-271.\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】According to the obtained results， it can be concluded that since there were no significant differences between the angles of 60and 90 degrees of the screw in terms of mean tolerated tensile force， it seems that in cases where the surgeon faces with limited access during surgery or screw placement path interference with essential anatomical elements， he can use a 60-degree screw angle.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Postoperatively， sloughing of the overlying skin led to mesh exposure. An attempted rotational flap coverage was complicated by small bowel injury， which was recognized and repaired. However， an entero-atmospheric fistula developed after the removal of contaminated mesh. The fistula was initially treated by vacuum-assist-ed closure dressing and later was converted to a 'stoma’. Six months later， the small bowel segment bearing the fistula was excised and bowel continuity was restored.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】In selected cases， the conversion of entero-atmospheric fistula to a 'stoma' allows the patient to be discharged home early and maintain good nutritional status while awaiting the definitive surgical intervention.\n\n【5】Key words： laparoscopy· incisional hernia repair · colon injury · entero-atmospheric fistula · stomaThe sudden appearance of an entero-atmospheric fistula (EAF) after any abdominal surgery is devastating for both patient and surgeon. It is often associated with fluid and electrolyte disturbances， as well as nutritional deficiency and life-threat-ening sepsis . Hence， its treatment is challenging and is associated with high morbidity and mortality .\n\n【6】The initial management is conservative and， although often fu-tile， it should be tried before definitive treatment is contemplated. Generally speaking， proximal high-output fistulae rarely close without surgery， while distal low-output fistulae may close spon-taneously with conservative therapy， provided there is no distal obstruction and no foreign body is present . In EAF， sponta-neous healing is hampered by lack of vascularized tissue cover-age over the exposed bowel and by continuous efflux of irritating enteric contents . Several methods have been tried to over-come these problems and to facilitate fistula management .\n\n【7】We report a case of EAF that developed after attempted lap-aroscopic repair of a recurrent incisional hernia. It was man-aged by converting the fistula to a 'stoma'. This case highlights some challenging management issues that could be of benefit to surgeons regularly performing laparoscopic incisional her-nia repairs. It also introduces a feasible temporary solution to this daunting complication.\n\n【8】A 60-year-old woman， known to have asthma， hypertension， and diabetes， was admitted for laparoscopic repair of recur-rent incisional hernia (post-caesarian section) following 4pre vious open repairs. Clinically， she was obese (BMI 45 kg/m2) and the abdomen showed multiple scars of previous surger-ies， with a medium-size incisional hernia in the right lower abdomen， which was easily reducible. After attention to the co-morbidities， she underwent a laparoscopic repair. Dense adhesions were encountered and upon mobilization of her-nia contents， the cecum was inadvertently injured in multi-ple places. We converted to an open procedure and a limited ileo-cecal resection was performed. As no absorbable mesh-es were available， the defect was reluctantly repaired using\n\n【9】Proceed mesh (Ethicon Inc， Johnson and Johnson Company，\n\n【10】USA). On the fifth postoperative day， a small area (3x5 cm) of skin necrosis sloughed，exposing the underlying mesh. This was managed initially with frequent dressing， but later a ro-tational flap was used to cover the exposed mesh. During mobilization of the flap， the small bowel was inadvertent-ly injured， but it was repaired in 2 layers using 3/0 polydiox-anone (PDS) sutures. Four days later， small bowel contents were noted in the subcutaneous drain， but there were no signs of peritonism. The contaminated mesh was removed and the fistula was intubated using a T-tube. The bowel was temporarily covered with Permacol biological mesh (Covidien，Cedex， France)， and the wound was dressed. Later， the T-tube was removed and a vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) machine was used. Because the wound around the fistula was gran-ulating well after the disintegration of the biological mesh， the EAF was converted to a'stoma’ by the appli-cation of split-skin skin graft over the granulating area and suturing the fistula edges to skin . A stoma bag was then applied and oral fluids and later soft and solid di-ets were gradually introduced. Initially， the ‘stoma’ output was liquid， causing distressing leakage and soiling， but after the introduction of solid diet and Peptamen (Nestle， Vevey， Switzerland) per mouth， contents started to solidify. She was given stoma care education and discharged home after the'stoma' output was 3-4 soft bowel movements/day. The to-tal hospital stay was 75 days.\n\n【11】She was readmitted 6 months later for ‘stoma’ closure. Preoperative nutritional status was adequate and CT eval-uation showed a hernia containing large and small bowels. The abdomen revealed skin excoriation at the in-ferior aspect of the 'stoma' . At surgery， the abdo-men was entered through a fresh upper mid-line incision. All bowel loops were dissected free from the hernia sac af-ter division of adhesions with extreme caution to avoidcreating enterotomies. The fistula-bearing small bowel seg-ment  was then resected， and bowel continuity was restored by a stapled side-to-side anastomosis. The abdomi-nal wall defect was closed using underlay biological Permacol mesh (Covidien， Cedex， France). She was electively ventilat ed for 24 hours and was discharged home 14 days later. At9-month follow-up， she was noted to have a recurrent her-nia， but was advised to stay on conservative treatment be-cause she was asymptomatic， her hernia was reducible，and the likelihood of recurrence was high.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】EAF is defined as presence of an enteric fistula in the set-ting of an open abdomen. It is a serious complication that occurs after trauma and any major abdominal procedure. Its management is complex and leads to increased cost. Moreover， the morbidity and mortality remain high de-spite modern advances in medical care . Patients who survive the initial metabolic insults may require future sur-gical intervention to close the fistula. This is often challeng-ing and technically demanding， and is poorly described in the literature .\n\n【14】The initial management is nil per mouth， total parenteral nutrition， control of sepsis， and containment of fistula out-put . An attempt at non-surgical management should be tried before definitive treatment is contemplated. This may allow spontaneous closure， thus avoiding the risks of a major reoperative procedure . The conservative ap-proach was tried in this case， despite fistula failure to show signs of healing. Early surgical intervention was deferred be-cause the abdomen was considered ‘hostile'. Resection of the non-healing fistula constitutes the final definitive op-eration. This requires careful planning and meticulous ex-ecution of the resection to maximize the chances of suc-cessful resolution .\n\n【15】In EAF， spontaneous healing is hampered by lack of vascular-ized tissue coverage over the exposed bowel. Moreover， con-tinuous efflux of irritating enteric contents and chronic expo-sure of the viscera contribute to increased protein loss， septic infection， and high mortality . Several methods have been described to avoid visceral exposure， such as use of cathe ters to intubate the fistula and early mobilization of skin and subcutaneous flaps ； both methods were tried in this case. Control of the efflux is achieved by surgical exteriorization and proximal diversion. This may be difficult to perform due to mesenteric shortening as a result of soft tissue and bow-el edema . Alternatively， a “floating stoma\" may be creat-ed wherein the edges of the fistula are sutured to a plastic silo over which a stoma appliance is placed . However， coverage of the fistula with well-vascularized soft tissue rep-resents the most effective strategy for control and eventual healing . In this case， we employed an approach that en-tailed coverage of the exposed but granulating the area with a split-skin graft and suturing the fistula edges to the skin，cre-ating a 'stoma'， albeit in a non-conventional position . This meant converting the EAF to a 'stoma' that can be cared for in the usual manner， allowing the patient to be dis-charged home and obviating the need to stay in hospital whilewaiting for the definitive surgical procedure. This has contrib-uted immensely to reducing the hospital length of stay and financial costs， and also improved the patient’s psychologi-cal morale and wellbeing. This method was made possible by the fact that the fistula was located in the distal ileum， as in-dicated by the CT scan  and by the solidification of the fistula affluent after the trial of Peptamen (Nestle S.A.， Vevey， Switzerland) oral consumption. This approach would have been difficult to employ if the fistula had been located in the proximal jejunum.\n\n【16】Other essential surgical strategies are temporary coverage of the open abdomen with an absorbable mesh， skin graft-ing of the exposed area， and the selective use of vacuum-as-sisted wound closure . Unfortunately， there were no ab-sorbable meshes available at the time of ileocecal resection. and attempted use of a number of biological meshes was hampered by their poor quality due to manufacturer error. However， VAC dressing was used in our patient with bene-ficial effect in controlling the efflux and minimizing dressing changes. That proved to be rewarding for both patient and nurses. However， during its use， extreme caution was exer-cised by applying intermittent mode， low suction pressure to avoid creating more fistulae .\n\n【17】It may be argued that the fistula happened due to an ileo-col-ic anastomotic stricture that has caused back pressure on the site of enterotomy repair. However， this was not the case， as it was not evident at the time of the definitive surgical procedure.\n\n【18】Although some authors have advocated early surgical in-tervention for fistula closure ， others advocated against re-operating earlier than 3 months from the date of insult or trauma . The delayed option will allow those fistulasthat are likely to close an opportunity to do so， while at the same time decreasing the risks of multiple enterotomies and difficult dissection in the immediate postoperative period. We opted here for the delayed surgical intervention， which proved to be beneficial in achieving an eventual successful outcome. Regardless of which strategy is adopted， it is im-portant to ensure bowel patency distal to the fistula prior to surgical fistula takedown， because the presence of untreat-ed distal bowel obstruction will preclude a favorable outcome of this procedure .\n\n【19】We report this case to highlight some challenging issues in the management of iatrogenic EAF and to introduce a feasi-ble temporary solution by converting the fistula to amanage-able 'stoma' in selected cases with a distal small bowel fistula.\n\n【20】We believe that in selected patients with distal iatrogenic EAF， the conversion of the fistula into 'stoma' is feasible and effective in temporarily controlling the fistula. This is cost-effective because it is associated with reduced hospital stay and allows the patient to be discharged home early. It also allows the patient to main-tain good nutritional status while awaiting the definitive surgical intervention. The delayed surgical intervention is advocated and it is recommended to wait at least 3-6 months from the date of the last operation before attempting the fistula/’stoma'closure.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Computed tomography scan of orbit showed a well circumscribed， non-enhanced homogeneous orbital mass affecting the retrobulbar aspect of the orbit. A lateral orbitotomy approach was performed and the lesions were excised. The histological evaluation showed the tumors were composed of spindle-shaped cells within collagen bundles and vascular channels. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34) and vimentin but was negative for S-100 protein， epithelial membrane antigen， cytokeratin， smooth muscle actin and desmin.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】Before 1994 the diagnosis orbital solitary fibrous tumor was confused with other benign orbital tumor. It must be immunohistochemically differentiated from other spindle-cell tumors of the orbit. The treatment is a complete surgical excision， and long-term follow-up is necessary.\n\n【6】Key words： solitary fibrous tumor· Immunohistochemical study ·orbit·CD34\n\n【7】BACKGROUND\n\n【8】Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is the name given to a distinct and rare spindle cell neoplasm， which most frequently arises from the pleura . Althoughini-tially described as a pleural mesothelial tumor ， this tumor has also been reported at extra pleural-sites . SFTs arising in the orbit are relatively rare. However， in the last few years there have been several case reports and short series of orbital SFT.\n\n【9】Orbital SFT can be localized anywhere in the orbit， and tends to pursue an indolent course .\n\n【10】SFTs generally behave in a benign manner and do not metastasize \n\n【11】Although it is more commonly seen in middle-aged patients， it can also affect young children . Local recurrences and malignant transformation are pos-sible and relate to incomplete initial excision or an aggressive histological pattern of the tumor .\n\n【12】We report one case of orbital SFT， and discuss the clinical presentation， pre-operative differential diag-nosis ， radiological characteristics， histopathological and immunohistochemical features， differential di-agnosis， treatment， and prognosis of this rare tumor with a review of the previous literatures.\n\n【13】CASE REPORT\n\n【14】A 40-year-old woman had a 4-month history of pro-gressive proptosis of the right eye after a blunt trauma to orbit. Ophthalmic evaluation revealed normal vi-sual acuity and normal pupil examination； extraocular motility examination showed limited up-gaze in the right eye， but the patient did not report double vision. Hertel exophthalmometry showed 5 mm of proptosis in the right eye. Indirect funduscopic ophthalmoscopy was normal. The patient had a history of car accident and blunt trauma to orbit. Complete blood count andchest radiograph results were within normal limits. Computed tomography scan revealed a well delin-eated and homogeneous orbital mass affecting the retrobulbar aspect of the orbit . No signs of bony erosion or globe indentation were visible. A lat-eral orbitotomy approach was performed and a round， encapsulated 2.5-cm mass was completely excised. Before surgery， a benign lesion such as fibrous his-tiocytoma and hematic cyst was suspected but orbital SFT was not included in our preoperative differential diagnosis. The final diagnosis relied on the distinctive histopathological pattern and immunohistochemical staining. Microscopically the tumor was composed of fibrocollagenous tissue and spindle cells arranged in a fascicular pattern around thick collagen fibers. Immunohistochemical staining revealed an intense and diffuse positive reaction to cluster of differentiation 34(CD34)  and vimentin， but a negative reaction to S-100 protein， epithelial membrane antigen， cytokeratin， smooth muscle actin and desmin. The diagnosis was consistent with SFT. At the 6-month follow-up visit the patient showed no signs or symptoms of recurrence.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n\n【16】The first SFT presenting in the orbit was indepen-dently reported in 1994 by Dorfman et al  and Westra et al ， respectively. Stout and Murray first described the microscopic appearance of SFT .\n\n【17】SFT should be considered in the differential diagno-sis when a patient presents with a well-circumscribed tumor causing unilateral proptosis with intensely en-hancing mass seen on the CT scan evaluation. SFT of the orbit does not have any systemic symptoms which are known to occur in cases of SFT occurring at pleural sites .\n\n【18】Solitary fibrous tumor shows a patternless， hypercel-lular and hypocellular region of spindle cells， against a background of thick collagen bands .\n\n【19】SFT is immunoreactive for mesenchymal markers such as vimentin but negative for desmin， epithelial marker(cytokeratin， epithelial membrane antigen)， vascular marker (factor VIII related antigen)， neural markers(S-100 protein)， and muscle specific actin and smooth muscle actin . Immunoreactivity with the marker CD34 is present in 79-100% of cases .\n\n【20】A wide range of mesenchymal tumors occur in the orbit. The light microscopic differential diagnosis of orbital SFT includes fibrous histiocytoma (the most common mesenchymal orbital tumor in adults)， rare fibroblastic tumors such as the juvenile fibromatosis of the orbit， and other uncommon spindle-cell tumors such as hemangiopericytoma， nerve sheath tumors， giant cell angiofibroma， fibromyxoid sarcoma， monophasic syno-vial sarcoma and meningioma. Therefore， it is possible that previous orbital SFTs have been misdiagnosed. Recently， strong and consistent CD34 immunoreactiv-ity has been found in SFTs and this marker facilitates histopathological differentiation of this lesion from other spindle-cell tumors of the orbit .\n\n【21】Reactive conditions such as nodular fasciitis also are negative for CD34 . SFT， fibrous histiocytoma， and hemangiopericytoma all show positive reactiv-ity with CD34， although to varying degrees . Fibrous histiocytoma shows focal positivity for CD34. In addition， it also shows intense staining with various keratins， property not shared by SFT . It is the strong and generalized CD34 immunoreactivity of SFT that differentiates this tumor from hemangio-pericytoma， which has a similar histological pattern but has weak and patchy CD34 immunohistochemi-cal positivity .\n\n【22】In our case， strong and generalized immunoreactiv-ity for CD34 and vimentin is suggestive for SFT ac-cording to previous study. Negative reaction to S-100protein， epithelial membrane antigen， cytokeratin， smooth muscle actin and desmin can exclude nerve sheath tumors， meningioma， fibrous histiocytoma and smooth muscle tumors respectively.\n\n【23】In this tumor the criteria of malignancy include the presence of more than four mitosis per high-power field(or the presence of abnormal mitotic figures)， cellular pleomorphism， or tumor giant cells. There is only one reported case of malignant SFT of the orbit .\n\n【24】The treatment of choice of orbital SFT is complete surgical excision and careful follow-up. Seven cases of recurrent orbital SFT have been reported， and the single most important factor in predicting recurrence is initial incomplete excision .\n\n【25】The value of adjuvant chemotherapy or irradiation is not known .\n\n【26】There are no reports of orbital SFT leading to death.\n\n【27】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【28】In recent years， there has been a steady increase in the number of extrapleural sites of occurrence of SFTs reported， including the orbit.\n\n【29】Immunohistochemical study is an important adju-vant in determining the SFT diagnosis. The strong CD34 immunoreactivity of this tumor supports its diagnosis.\n\n【30】Orbital SFT seem to pursue a benign non-aggressive course. However， because of the small number of re-ported cases， as well as the limited follow-up， it is not possible at present to assert that tumors in extrapleural sites behave differently from those in the pleura. Careful long-term follow-up is necessary because recurrence may appear long after excision of the primary tumor.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The disease is classified into an acute and chronic phase； the latter is a life-long infection that can be asymptom-atic or progress to cardiac or digestive complications.\n\n【2】Case Report： We report a case of acute-phase Chagas disease， transmitted by the splash of gut content from an infected tri-atomine into the conjunctival mucosa.\n\n【3】Conclusions： The diagnosis of Chagas disease is made by the direct visualization of the parasite in blood smears during the acute phase of the disease； during the chronic phase of the disease the diagnosis is made by the detection of IgG antibodies. Parasitological cure can be achieved in up to 80% of the cases in acute phase of the disease， in contrast with less than 30% during the chronic phase.\n\n【4】MeSH Keywords： Acute Disease · Chagas Disease · Trypanosoma Cruzi\n\n【5】Chagas disease is a chronic parasitosis caused by the kineto plastid protozoon Trypanosoma cruzi. Due to the worldwide bur-den of the disease， the WHO recognized it as one of the most important neglected tropical diseases . Currently， there are no screening programs in endemic countries . According to a 2010 WHO report， more than 25 million people are at risk of infection globally and in Mexico it could potentially affect5.5 million . The global economic burden of Chagas disease is estimated to be at $7.19 billion per year and $188.80 bil-lion per lifetime， similar to or higher than other prominent dis-eases such as cervical cancer . In an effort to reduce vector transmission， several programs have been implemented dur-ing the last decades， such as the Southern Zone Initiative to Control/Eliminate Chagas disease， the Andean Pact Initiative， and the Central America Initiative. However， recent studies re-port resistance to pyrethroids， the insecticide most common-ly used to eliminate the vectors， and this finding might nega-tively affect the progress of these programs . Mexico hosts one of the most diverse triatomine populations， with at least21 species able to be infected with T cruzi. The rate of infec-tion in prone species has been reported to be as high as 50%. Meccus pallidipennis is the most commonly captured triato-mine in the state of Morelos . More than 180 domestic， synanthropic， and wild species of mammals， especially nest-building rodents and opossums， are likely to be infected with T. cruzi and to be involved in the transmission cycle of the dis-ease. Dogs， cats， and rodents are important domestic reser-voirs. Moreover， dogs and cats are very often observed to have a very high prevalence of T. cruzi infection .\n\n【6】The transmission of the disease occurs mainly by the vector(80-90%) when the feces of the infected triatomine bug are inoculated into a bite wound or through intact mucous mem-branes. Less frequent modes of transmission include transfu sion (5-20%) and congenitally (0.5%). Rarely， the disease can be acquired by organ transplantation， laboratory accidents， and ingestion of food or liquids contaminated by T. cruzi . The disease is classified into an acute and a chronic phase. The acute phase occurs 1-2 weeks after the infected bug bites the host； most patients present a mild，self-limited， nonspecif-ic febrile illness and a sign of portal of entry， such as chagoma or Romana's sign. The latter occurs when the parasite is inoc-ulated into the conjunctival sac. Severe， acute， life-threaten-ing infection can present with myocarditis， meningoenceph-alitis， or both； death occurs occasionally in the acute phase(<5-10% of symptomatic cases) . The chronic phase can be an indeterminate form with a life-long asymptomatic infec-tion， or progress to a determinate form with myocardiopathy， megadigestive syndromes， or the combination of both. The an-nual mortality rate in these patients varies widely across dif-ferent studies (0.2-19.2%)， in part due to the heterogeneityof the patient populations . The acute phase of the disease is characterized by highly active parasite replication， and only during this phase can the parasite be detected by microscopy in blood smears， which makes the diagnosis of acute-phase infection possible. Due to the host immune response，the par-asite is undetectable by blood smear microscopy during the chronic phase， making the detection of lgG antibodies against the parasite the best diagnostic test during this phase .\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】The patient was a 44-year-old man from Morelos， Mexico，with medical records of systemic hypertension， obesity， and im-paired fasting glucose. He had been well until approximately1 month before admission， when he smashed a bug whose gut contents splashed onto his right eye. Twenty 20 days later he developed periorbital edema in his right eye， 39℃ fever， and frontotemporal headache. He presented to his primary care physician， who diagnosed periorbital cellulitis on the basis of clinical presentation and prescribed antibiotic and anti-inflam-matory treatment while the patient was ambulatory， without any clinical improvement. Upon admission to our hospital the patient looked ill， was diaphoretic， and had periorbital edema. The conjunctiva was hyperemic， photomotor and consensual reflexes were present， there were no palpable lymph nodes， and the other results of the physical examination were un-remarkable. Because the patient lives in a place endemic for American trypanosomiasis， the periorbital edema was suspect-ed to be a sign of portal of entry (Romana’s sign) . The patient was shown images of insects and recognized the insect he smashed as a triatomine bug， M. pallidipennis .\n\n【9】His laboratory studies reported leukocytes of 11 800 cel/puL， neutrophils 6372 cel/pL， lymphocytes 4720 cel/pL， Hb 12.7 g/dL， platelet count 218 000/pL， glucose 115 mg/dL， urea 40 mg/dL creatinine 1.5 mg/dL， total bilirubin 0.7 mg/dL， aspartate ami-notransferase 43 U/L， alanine aminotransferase 40 U/L， DHL765 U/L total proteins 6 mg/dL， and albumin 2.3 mg/dL. A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm， frequency of 100， and QRS axis at 10°. Cardiac enzymes reported CPK 158 U/L\nand CKMB 14.5 U/L. Due to the patient history， American try-panosomiasis was suspected and a blood smear was request-ed， which showed the presence of a flagellated parasite， T. cru-zi . American trypanosomiasis in acute phase without myocarditis diagnosis was established. The patient began ni-furtimox treatment at a 10 mg/kg/day dose for 60 days. He showed remarkable clinical improvement and was discharged home to complete treatment. Currently， the patient remains asymptomatic and is evaluated annually to monitor for any chronic complications of Chagas disease.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Active parasite replication exists during the acute phase of the disease， which makes the detection of the parasite in blood smears possible. During the chronic phase， the immune system lowers the parasite burden to levels that are undetectable by blood-smear microscopy. However， T. cruzi amastigotes can be found in tissues， especially in cardiac and skeletal muscle . The amplification of T. cruzi DNA using polymerase chain re-action is the leading test for assessing response to treatment in a short period of time， in contrast with microscopy， which lacks sensitivity， and blood cultures， which can take up to 30days and have a higher rate of false-negative results . Currently， there are no biomarkers to assess the therapeutic response in chronic Chagas disease . The diagnosis of the acute phase of the disease is difficult due to the mild symp-toms； it is diagnosed in less than 10% of patients who have this phase of Chagas disease .\n\n【12】It is recommended to treat all patients with acute， congeni-tal， and reactivated infection， as well as infected children ir-respective of the phase of the disease， patients younger than18 years of age， and patients 19-50 years with indeterminate phase of the disease . Nifurtimox and benznidazole are the only 2 therapeutic options that have been available in recent decades. Due to its safer profile and better tolerability， benz-nidazole is considered the first-line treatment and is given in doses of 5 mg/kg/day for 60 days. Nifurtimox is given in a dose of 8-10 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses for 60-90 days . In the acute phase of the disease， treatment reduces the du-ration and severity of the symptoms and achieves a parasito-logical cure in 60-85% of patients . In the chronic phase of the disease， treatment can slow the development and pro-gression of Chagas cardiomyopathy.\n\n【13】After about 20 years， 15-30% of patients will develop a chron-ic complication of Chagas disease； this prompts the search for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal symptoms and use of a resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) to define the clinical form of the disease. Patients with a normal ECG and with no gastrointestinal symptoms should be followed up every 12-24 months . These patients have a better prognosis than patients with advanced heart disease，which indicates a poor prognosis .\n\n【14】Conclusions\n\n【15】Chagas disease continues to be an important public health problem worldwide. Efforts to reduce the rates of transmis-sion have been unsuccessful due to insecticide resistance and the complexity of the distribution of the disease between wild and domestic reservoirs. Diagnosis during the acute phase of the disease is critical for patient prognosis， but the nonspecific clinical findings make this challenging. Chagas disease should be considered a differential diagnosis in patients living in en-demic areas presenting with nonspecific febrile illness. We be-lieve this is the first case report of Chagas disease transmit-ted by the splash of gut contents from an infected triatomine bug into the human conjunctival mucosa.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Here， we present a case of unusual cutaneous ecthyma gangrenosum complicated by septic shock and end-organ failure despite the absence of bac-teremia and neutropenia. Thus， in immunocompromised pa-tients with suspected signs of septic shock， careful examina-tion of any skin lesion might reveal the source of infection.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】Three days following the administration of amikacin for an E. coli-infected amputation stump of the big toe， a 52-year-old diabetes patient with myelofibrosis presented with hemor-rhagic vesicular eruption， vesiculobullous lesions， and necrot-ic eschar-covered erosive ulcerated lesions over the upper and lower extremities， gluteal and anogenital areas， and oral and nasal mucosa. The lesions were also associated with a right eye discharge . The patient was pale and looked unwell. Moreover， he presented with severe lower gastrointes-tinal bleeding. His blood pressure was 98/54 mmHg， and his temperature was 36.7℃. Blood chemistry and complete blood count (CBC) laboratory test results were as follows： CBC includ-ing platelets： 396x10° (his baseline was 600-900)； white blood cells (WBC)： 17×10/L ； hemoglobin： 5.7 G/dL ； WBC differential： 85% neutrophils and 8% lymphocytes； plate let large cell ratio： 40%； arterial blood gas analyses： pH： 7.36， pCO2： 36.9 mmHg， p02： 31 mmHg， a02： 33.4%； urea： 39.7mmol/L (3.2-7.1)； creatinine： 290 umol/L ； aspartate transaminase： 424 U/L ； alanine transaminase： 395 U/L； direct bilirubin： 20.8 umol/L ； international nor-malized ratio： 3.6%(0.9-1.2)； partial thromboplastin time： 45.9seconds ； prothrombin time： 46.9 seconds (9.8-13.2).\n\n【10】Because the patient gave a history of severe beta-lactam-in-duced allergic reactions， a non-dermatologist suspected that anaphylaxis was the underlying cause of his initial clinical pre-sentation； ie， hypotension and a cutaneous rash that appeared right after systemic antibiotic ingestion.\n\n【11】However， after a careful examination of the nature of his cu-taneous lesions by an expert dermatologist， along with the overall clinical status and the preliminary lab findings， septic shock with signs of end-stage organ failure was suspected to be the top differential diagnosis.\n\n【12】A bacterial culture grown from a swab of a leg cutaneous le-sion underneath the scab was positive for Pseudomonas aeru-ginosa. Histopathological findings of an ulcerated vesicular le-sion obtained from the thumb showed epidermal necrosis and sloughing， in addition to sparse neutrophilic vasculitis that ex-tended deeply into the subcutaneous tissue， with violaceous fi-brinous debris surrounding the vascularwall . A Gram stain preparation of the tissue revealed numerous gram-neg-ative rods surrounding necrotic blood vessels.\n\n【13】Upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed and failed to identify any necrotic， inflammatory， or pathologic causes of bleeding， which was probably related to the deterio-ration of his coagulation profile. Given these results， a diagno-sis of ecthyma gangrenosum-induced septic shock was made.\n\n【14】Since this patient had a history of severe allergic reactions to beta-lactam antibiotics， and the antibacterial sensitivity results were readily available within the first 3 days， levofloxacin was initiated to treat the antibiotic-resistant Pseudomonas sp. infec-tion. This patient was successfully managed with early initiation of proper antibiotics after consulting infectious disease special-ists and was discharged from the intensive care unit 10 days af-ter starting the antibiotics. Six weeks after being discharged from the hospital， the patient was doing well， his renal and liver func-tions were normal， and his coagulation profile was also normal.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Although the patient presented to the emergency room as hy-potensive， the timeline between the administration of amikacinand his presentation， as well as the types of skin lesions， did not suggest a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction. The most com-monly reported allergic reactions to aminoglycosides are caused by gentamicin and tobramycin， with amikacin being the least reported cause. Allergies to aminoglycosides are infrequent compared with cephalosporins or quinolones .\n\n【17】Microscopic polyangiitis would be another differential diagno-sis to consider in the context of small-medium vessel neutro-philic vasculitis and clear evidence of acute kidney injury (AKI). However， in septic-looking， hypotensive patients with signs of end-stage organ failure， disseminated intravascular coagula-tion (DIC)-induced hemorrhage， and clear evidence of positive bacterial culture， a diagnosis of ecthyma gangrenosum com-plicated by septic shock is highly suggested .\n\n【18】The patient's clinical findings were highly suggestive of bacterial sepsis， including a systolic blood pressure of <90 mmHg， neutro-phil/lymphocyte ratio of>10：1， and relative thrombocytopenia， with a high platelet large cell ratio， while the following compli-cations suggested septic shock： AKI， DIC， and acute respiratory distress syndrome . Although the patient was afebrile， immu-nocompromised patients can develop sepsis with normothermia.\n\n【19】Although ecthyma gangrenosum is commonly associated with Pseudomonas bacteremia， it rarely presents as a primary skin infection. Our patient’s blood and urine cultures were negative， which was favorable regarding the likelihood of a response to treatment. Blood cultures may be obtained before initiating antibiotic therapy； however， immediate treatment for septic shock should ensue without delay. Ecthyma gangrenosum has a high mortality rate if diagnosis and treatment is delayed； thus， prompt treatment strategies under the care of a multi-disciplinary team involving infectious disease specialists and the intensive care unit must be implemented.\n\n【20】While awaiting the results， antipseudomonal penicillins in con-junction with gentamicin can be used as an empirical treat-ment . However， when the antibacterial sensitivity results are readily available， the choice of proper antibiotics should be based on those results. Therefore， oral levofloxacin was initiated to treat the antibiotic-resistant Pseudomonas infec-tion， based on retained susceptibility as shown by the local resistance pattern7.\n\n【21】Conclusions\n\n【22】Early detection and a high suspicion of ecthyma gangrenosum， with special consideration for the clinical presentation of ec-thyma gangrenosum， is a vital part of patient management to reduce the high mortality risk of the disease. Although bactere-mia is associated with a high risk for fatalities， cutaneous ec-thyma gangrenosum is also serious， as it can be complicated by septic shock and serious adverse events. The involvement of multidisciplinary teams in patient management is an es-sential aspect of ecthyma gangrenosum disease management.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Common complications such as pneumothorax， bleeding， and rare cas-es of air embolisms leading to stroke have been documented as well. It is reported that there is a 0.06-0.08%risk of air embolism resulting in stroke in patients undergoing CT-guided lung biopsy. However， other causes of ischemic stroke following lung biopsy should be considered\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 36-year-old obese man presented with chronic shortness of breath， intermittent fever， and night sweats. Chest CT showed multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules with basilar predominance， and laboratory test results that showed no acute infections， a negative TB QuantiFERON， and a normal transthoracic echocardiogram. Therefore， elective lung biopsy was performed to direct future medical therapy. Shortly after the procedure， the patient reported having right-sided vision loss and decreased sensation on the right half of his face， arms， and legs. Non-contrast CT of the brain showed no hemorrhage and no air intracranially. Therefore， following a Neurology consult， the stroke protocol was initiated， which resulted in tPA being administered. TPA use re-solved the patient's symptoms， with no signs of hemorrhage.\n\n【4】Conclusions： Air embolisms have commonly been the cause of strokes following CT-guided lung biopsies， which can be de-tected on CT brain with signs of air intracranially. However， our case presents an ischemic cause of stroke with no evidence of air embolisms intracranially. Multidisciplinary stroke team consultations and consideration of alternative causes of stroke following CT-guided lung biopsy can be lifesaving， as urgent medical therapy can be delayed without proper considerations.\n\n【5】Keywords： Embolic Stroke ·Thromboembolism\n\n【6】Abbreviation： TPA - tissue plasminogen activator\n\n【7】The majority of lung biopsies are for diagnostic purposes to determine if pulmonary lesions are infectious， inflammatory， or malignant . Although uncommon， complications of lung biopsies include hemoptysis， pneumothorax， and rare cases of ischemic strokes caused by air embolism . Other causes of stroke include thromboembolic stroke that develops from blood clot formation in the vasculature that travels to the brain， causing stroke. Our report presents an unusual patho-physiology of ischemic stroke following CT-guided lung biopsy.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 36-year-old morbidly obese man with prior gastric sleeve gastrectomy presented with chronic shortness of breath， in-termittent fever， and night sweats. An outpatient CT scan of chest  demonstrated multiple bilateral pulmo-nary nodules with a basilar predominance. Additional evalu-ation included a normal transthoracic echocardiogram， nega-tive coccidiomycosis， negative TB QuantiFERON， and negative sputum and blood cultures. CT-guided lung biopsy was com-pleted with a 17-gauge introducer needle and 18-gauge core biopsy needle ， using moderate sedation and local anesthesia. The procedure was unremarkable， and post-pro-cedure imaging showed only slight perinodular hemorrhage， without pneumothorax. Within 30 min after the procedure， he reported having abrupt right-sided inferior quadrantanopsia vision loss and right-sided numbness of the face， arms， and legs. A CT scan without contrast of the brain showed no acute changes and， specifically， no intracranial air . A CT angiogram of the brain demonstrated no large-vessel occlu-sion or filling defect， and no vascular malformation. The chest portion of the exam showed no further hemorrhage and no pneumothorax， but demarcated the biopsied right lung nod-ule well， showing an internal vessel draining to the right infe-rior pulmonary vein .\n\n【10】Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was adminis-tered per the weight-based stroke protocol， which restored the majority of the vision loss， with resolution of the right-sided numbness. The following day， MRI  showed 2 adja-cent punctate acute infarcts in the left occipital lobe periphery， correlating with the primary visual cortex， with no correspond-ing hemorrhage . Cardiac evaluation demonstrated no evidence of atrial fibrillation， with telemonitoring and trans-esophageal echocardiogram demonstrated no vegetations or atrial thrombus， and a negative bubble study. The lung biopsy pathology report noted acute and chronic inflammatory infil-trates but showed no malignancy， no sign of tuberculosis， and no definitive abnormal hematologic populations. The patientwas discharged several days later on aspirin， high-dose statin， and occupational therapy for residual eye fatigue.\n\n【11】One month later， the patient returned with progressive short-ness of breath. Direct Coombs IgG was positive， and the patient was diagnosed with warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia， a known cause of hypercoagulability， as well as a condition asso-ciated with increased incidence of thromboembolic events .\n\n【12】Complications of lung biopsies have been well documented in the literature， including hemoptysis， pneumothorax， and rare cases of cerebrovascular accident . Strokes as a complica-tion are very rare and most are air emboli， with a risk of 0.06-0.08%. Suspicion for cerebral air embolism is warranted when patients present with focal neurologic changes following lung biopsy procedures and supported by visualization of air in-tracranially on MRl or CT . Additionally，ifindeed a patient experienced an air embolism， a CT scan would detect even the smallest amounts of air due to air's negative 1000 Hounsfield units， which creates a large contrast with brain parenchyma.\n\n【13】However， our patient’s course suggested a thromboembol-ic etiology. Immediately following our patient's stroke， a CT scan showed an absence of intracranial air， providing suspi-cion for a non-air embolic stroke. An intracranial septic em-bolus can be also considered， especially given the nodule's traversing vessel sign， which is a finding of septic pulmonary emboli . However， imaging and laboratory values indicat-ed the patient had no ongoing infection， with no cardiac val-vular or septal defects. Considering the patient had no ongo-ing infection， the traversing vessel is a pulmonary vein witha direct pathway to the left atrium. Considering the timing of the stroke after biopsy， there is a much stronger possibility of a thromboembolic etiology than intracranial septic embolus.\n\n【14】For these reasons， the multidisciplinary stroke team decided to administer tPA， the medical protocol for non-hemorrhag-ic strokes. There is a higher risk of hemorrhage with admin-istration of tPA in intracranial septic embolus， but again， this alternative differential was felt to be less likely . The ben-efit of preserving an eloquent area， the visual cortex， in a rel-atively young patient outweighed the risk of possible intra-cranial hemorrhage.\n\n【15】The restoration of vision and improvement of symptoms after treatment provide support for a thromboembolic cause. Our proposed pathophysiology is likely related to trauma of the bi-opsied pulmonary nodule， resulting in a thrombus of the tra-versing vessel， a pulmonary vein， leading to the left atrium on imaging， and ultimately embolizing to the left occipital lobe，thus producing our patient’s symptoms. Additionally， unknown to us at the time， our patient was hypercoagulable， which also contributed to this extremely rare type of stroke after biopsy.\n\n【16】Conclusions\n\n【17】In conclusion， there are limited case reports of lung biopsy pro-cedures resulting in thromboembolic events as a cause of isch-emic stroke. Physicians should have increased awareness of this possibility， and consultation with multidisciplinary stroke teams should be completed in any acute neurological events associated with lung biopsies to avoid delay of treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

He had left shoulder dislocation confirmed by clinical and radiological examination. The patient lay face down on the trolley with trolley being raised with electronic controls. The shoulder was reduced with ease and the pa-tient was discharged home after radiologic confirmation of reduction.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】A new patient-controlled technique for reduction of the glenohumeral joint following dislocation is described. It is simple， safe， and effective to perform in Emergency Departments.\n\n【6】MeSH Keywords： Orthopedic Procedures · Shoulder Dislocation·Stretchers\n\n【7】The glenohumeral joint is the most mobile joint in the hu-man body due to the shallowness of the glenoid socket. This unique anatomy also makes it the most dislocated joint in humans. Males have up to 70% more dislocations compared to females， and 15-35 years age group is the commonest for shoulder dislocation . It is estimated that shoulder disloca-tion occurs in 1.69 per 1000 person-years in the community. Hippocrates described the oldest known methodology for relocation of the shoulder and a variety of techniques have since then been described to reduce the shoulder. We describe a new technique of shoulder reduction wherein the patient has the contro. and there is no need for sedation. In our case series we have observed 100% success rate.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 29-year-old presented to the Emergency Department after falling from scaffolding at work. He managed to hold on to the scaffolding rail with his left hand for a brief period of time before falling to the ground. He presented to the Emergency Department with severe pain in his left shoulder. He had no other injury to his body except bruises on the left hip and el-bow and was otherwise a healthy young man. He was not tak-ing any medication and had no significant medical or surgical history. He disliked needles and injections. He had no known allergy to any medication. Just before going to work he had his morning breakfast and then he had a cup of tea about 15minutes prior to arrival to the Emergency Department.\n\n【10】On examination， he was sitting upright with his shoulder in a sling provided by the paramedics. His pulse rate was regu lar at 98 beats per minute and he was normotensive. He had97% oxygen saturation on room air. Detailed clinical exami-nation revealed no injury other than the shoulder dislocation. His left shoulder muscles were in spasm. The humeral head was palpable anteriorly. He was holding his arm in slight ab-duction and external rotation. The deltoid region had normal sensation. His distal radial pulse and capillary refill at all the fingers were within normal range. Any movement of the shoul-der was extremely painful， but he was comfortable if there was no shoulder movement.\n\n【11】An urgent x-ray confirmed that the patient had anterior left shoulder dislocation without any fracture to the humerus. His glenoid fossa was intact. As patient had refused to have any needle inserted， he was not given any intravenous or in-tramuscular analgesics. He was not fasted； hence， immediate sedation had a high risk of aspiration. Clinical staff explained the non-sedating， non-needle technique of shoulder disloca-tion， for which he gave verbal consent.\n\n【12】The patient was asked to lie on the trolley with his face down in prone position. His left affected arm was hanging by the side of the trolley . The trolley was lowered so that the patient could hold the brake handle of the trolley. He was asked to continue to hold the handle as long as he could， giv-ing the control to the patient. A doctor then slowly pushed the trolley upwards with the control button as shown in the Figure 1， about 1 inch at a time and within tolerance of the patients' pain level. As the trolley was lifted about 3-4 inch-es over a period of 5 minutes， the shoulder was relocated. The patient felt a 'pop' and there was immediate pain relief.\n\n【13】Post-reduction clinical examination of the shoulder revealed normal contour of the shoulder and normal distal neurovascu-lar examination. Post-reduction x-ray films revealed a normal left glenohumeral joint. The patient was given a shoulder sling for a week for ligamentous recovery and was discharged home.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】There are 2 types of anterior shoulder dislocations described in the literature. Subcoracoid dislocations refer to the humer-al head slipping anteriorly and medially to the glenoid； this is the commonest type of dislocation. In a subglenoid anteri-or dislocation， the posterior of the humeral head slips inferior and slightly anterior to the glenoid . More than 90% of cases present with anterior dislocations . Other uncommon types of dislocations are posterior and luxation erecta. Subclavicular and intrathoracic are extremely rare types of shoulder dislo-cations  .\n\n【16】A number of techniques have been described in the literature for relocation of a dislocated glenohumeral joint. Kocher's method and Matson's traction-counter traction are some of the commonly used techniques. Both these techniques re-quire sedation and there is significant risk of brachial plexusor bone injury . Fares'technique does not use counter trac-tion but it involves pulling at wrist with a risk of stretching the neural bundles . Stimson's maneuver involves the pa-tient lying prone on a trolley and pull is provided by weights and sometimes by the assistant as well， but patient does not have control and hence there may even be a risk of falling off the trolley. The scapular maneuver is difficult to master and hence there is high risk of failure. The Milch and Spaso tech-niques are frequently impossible unless heavy sedation is giv-en， as the positioning of the arm is critical to the success of these procedures  .\n\n| Anterior dislocations  |\n| --- |\n| Subcoracoid type  |\n| Subglenoid type  |\n| Posterior  |\n| Luxatio erecta  |\n| Subclavicular  |\n| Intrathoracic  |\n\n【18】Our technique is a simple to perform. The patient has maxi-mum control and hence the likelihood of nerve or bone inju-ry is very low. The patient is fully awake and there is no need for any sedation. Most developed countries and many de-veloping countries as well have trollies with electronic con-trols ， so there is no need to buy any special equip-ment for this technique. As the clinician is not pulling any part of patients' body， there is no need to have a clinician with strong arms for this procedure. One operator is enough to per-form our technique. This procedure involves gentle electronic lifting up of the trolley and hence there is gradual stretch and subsequent relocation of the shoulder， which gives satisfac-tion to the patient and minimizes risk of neurovascular inju-ry. In our cases， we have not seen any complications and allof our reductions have been successful on the first attempt. We have performed a detailed literature search and have not found this technique described anywhere in the literature and hence we refer to this technique as the Doshi-Firke procedure for shoulder relocation.\n\n【19】Limitations of our technique are inability of the patient to lie down in prone position due to respiratory or other problems， in which case this procedure cannot be performed. Patient co-operation and willingness to comply are required for the suc-cess of the procedure. Extremely obese， pregnant， and very old patients may not be suitable for this technique. Hospitals without electronic-controlled trolleys may not be able to use our technique.\n\n【20】We suggest that this technique be used for all eligible patients and further case series reports be published in the literature. We conclude that this new and simple technique for shoulder relocation is safe and effective.\n\n【21】Conclusions\n\n【22】A new patient-controlled technique for reduction of the gle-nohumeral joint following dislocation is described. It is sim-ple， safe， and effective to perform in Emergency Departments.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Humans are inoculated through the gastrointestinal tract while consuming undercooked or raw seafood or through skin penetration. E. tarda has been isolated from marine environments， including lakes， rivers， wells， and sewage water. Although the bacte-rium has not been directly isolated from seawater， it has been cultured from animals inhabiting seawater en-vironments. In the United States， E. tarda is predominantly localized along the coastline of the Gulf of Mexico. Complications from this bacterium usually arise in patients with liver disease， iron overload， or cirrhosis or in those who are immunocompromised or on immunosuppressive therapy.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】Our patient was a 59-year-old woman with a history of advanced lung cancer， pulmonary hypertension， liv-er cirrhosis， hepatitis C， and alcoholism. She initially presented to the Emergency Department in the Florida Panhandle on June 16 with colitis， which then progressed to fulminant sepsis with septic shock. Despite ag-gressive interventions， including intravenous hydration， broad-spectrum antibiotics， and vasopressor support， our patient succumbed to her illness approximately 34 h after initial presentation.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】Although severe cases of E. tarda have been reported in patients with liver dysfunction， we believe this is the first reported case potentially complicated by concomitant lung cancer.\n\n【6】The rise in sea water temperature， increased human consumption of raw seafood， and increased prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis may increase the incidence and mortality of E. tarda in the near future.\n\n【7】Keywords： Edwardsiella tarda· Hepatitis C， Chronic· Vibrio Infections· Global Warming · Cirrhosis， CryptogenicEdwardsiella tarda is an anaerobic facultative gram-negative bacillus belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family . It is mainly found in ponds and warm and brackish waters along the coastlines of tropical and sub-tropical regions . Its car-riers include various marine animals and amphibians， such as oysters， fish， seals， lizards， and snakes. The majority of cases involving E. tarda infections originate in Japan， China， and the Gulf of Mexico in the United States. It is an unusual pathogen in humans. The Florida Department of Health reports a steady yearly increase in new cases and deaths due to warm water-borne pathogens . Most commonly， patients with E. tarda present with gastroenteritis after ingestion of contaminated raw seafood . Rare but severe cases of cellulitis or skin and muscle necrosis as well as osteomyelitis， meningitis， or life-threatening systemic infections after exposure of a wound or laceration to water have been reported . Patients who de-velop septicemia are usually immunocompromised and have underlying cirrhosis， chronic alcohol abuse， or iron overload ， resulting in a high mortality rate， even when the treatment is appropriate. The antibiotic regimen for E. tarda infections in-cludes standard gram-negative coverage with beta-lactams， third-and fourth-generation cephalosporins， fluoroquinolones， carbapenems， and aminoglycosides， depending on the level of susceptibility . We present the case of a patient with lung cancer， not on chemotherapy， yet she had cirrhosis of the liv-er and developed fatal E. tarda bacteremia after consuming raw oysters. Lung cancer is a potential new comorbidity that can increase the risk of developing a severe infection in this population. Lung cancer has not been reported as a risk fac-tor for E tarda. This is the first reported case of E. tarda in a patient with lung cancer.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 59-year-old woman with a history of advanced lung can-cer， pulmonary hypertension， cirrhosis of the liver， hepatitis C positivity， and history of alcohol abuse was brought in by ambulance to the Emergency Department of a hospital in the Florida Panhandle， during mid-summer， on June 16，2021.She had consumed raw oysters the previous day and complained of generalized lower abdominal pain that started the following morning. On initial presentation， the patient complained of a non-radiating dull abdominal ache. She denied fever and chills； there was no associated nausea or vomiting. The patient’s vi-tal signs were as follows： blood pressure 75/50 mm Hg； pulse rate， 100 beats/min； and respiratory rate， 22 breaths/min. The patient was afebrile with a temperature of 36.7℃， with no signs of distress， and was nontoxic. Upon physical examina-tion， she did not appear toxic， her lungs were clear， and there was lower abdominal tenderness without peritoneal signs. Thefollowing laboratory data were noted： while blood cell (WBC) count， 0.7 K/uL (reference range： 3.8-10.8 K/uL)； hemoglobin level， 12.5 g/dL (reference range： 13.5-17.5 g/dL)； platelet count，32 K/uL (reference range： 140-400 K/uL)； sodium， 144 mEg/L(reference range： 135-145 mEq/L)； potassium， 3.6 mEq/L (ref-erence range： 3.6-5.2 mEq/L)； creatinine， 1.75 mg/dL (reference range： 0.59-1.04 mg/dl)； BUN， 16 mg/dL (reference range： 6-24mg/dL)； glucose， 71 mg/dL (reference range： 70-100 mg/dL)； and albumin， 1.9 g/L (reference range： 3.5-5.5 g/dL).\n\n【10】The urinalysis was positive for infection and was notable for the following： +1 protein， +1 blood， +4 urobilinogen， 2.5 hya-line casts per high power field， 51 to 100 WBCs with clumps.\n\n【11】Her initial computerized tomography (CT) scan of the abdo-men and pelvis without intravenous (i.v.) contrast revealed wall thickening throughout the right colon and inflammation extending along the colon and surrounding the terminal ile-um and appendix. Portal venous congestion was observed. Cirrhosis of the liver was also confirmed， and there was pul-monary right lower lobe infiltrate， which was also present on the chest radiograph. No splenomegaly was noted on the CT scan. She was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with a di-agnosis of sepsis with shock related to colitis， right lower lobe pneumonia， and urinary tract infection.\n\n【12】Treatment began with i.v. fluid boluses， but after 4 L， she re-mained hypotensive， and a cardiovascular pressor with norepi-nephrine broad-spectrum antibiotics was also simultaneously initiated after appropriate blood and urine cultures were collect-ed. Cefepime， metronidazole， and levofloxacin were started to cover the respiratory and intra-abdominal sources of infection. Pharmacologic deep-vein thrombosis prophylaxis was not ad-ministered because of the patient's severe thrombocytopenia.\n\n【13】Granix (tbo-filgrastim) was administered. Despite her lung cancer diagnosis， she was not currently receiving chemother-apy but underwent radiation 2 months prior. Initially， her dys-pnea was treated with albuterol/ipratropium nebulization ev-ery 4 to 6 h， and her oxygen saturation remained above 93%.\n\n【14】The following day， the patient’s condition continued to dete-riorate. She developed acute hypoxic respiratory failure and progressive encephalopathy， requiring endotracheal intuba-tion and initiation of mechanical ventilation. After endotra-cheal intubation， an orogastric tube was placed. Septic shock and hypotension persisted， and the patient was also admin-istered albumin and started on continuous sodium bicarbon-ate infusion of 1 L of D5W with 150 mEq of sodium bicarbon-ate. Additionally， the vitamin C sepsis protocol was initiated， which included vitamin C， 500 mg i.v. every 8 h， hydrocorti-sone 100 mg i.v. every 6 h， and thiamine 200 mg i.v. every8 h . The preliminary blood culture showed gram-negativebacteremia， so doxycycline was added for presumptive Vibrio vulnificus coverage， considering that she ingested raw oysters. In this part of Florida， we are familiar with V vulnificus infec-tions in the summer as a result of consumption of raw oysters.\n\n【15】The following morning， about 34 h after initial arrival to the Emergency Department， the patient died， despite receiving ag gressive treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics， vitamin C protocol， albumin， i.v. fluid resuscitation， and maxed out car-diovascular pressor support. Prior to the patient's death， the nursing staff reported blisters and boils forming on the pa-tient's upper and lower extremities. The presence of E. tarda was revealed in 1 of 2 aerobic and 1 of 2 anaerobic postmor-tem blood cultures. After positive blood culture was obtained， the blood was plated on a negative combo panel and the re-sults were read with a Beckman Coulter micro scan.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Only E. tarda， from the genus Edwardsiella， is a foodborne and waterborne pathogen that infects humans in 3 different ways. The most common is intestinal presentation， such as gastro-enteritis， when raw seafood is consumed. The extraintestinal manifestations can be localized in the form of cellulitis， myo-necrosis， or even gas gangrene. This occurs with open wounds， trauma， and loss of skin integrity. These lesions can require surgical intervention. The most serious presentation is a sys-temic manifestation complex that can include septic shock， os-teomyelitis， cholecystitis， and meningitis. Systemic manifesta-tions carry a high risk of mortality . Cirrhosis of the liver， immunocompromised state， and liver disease with iron over-load have been the only risk factors reported for severe sep-sis with E.tarda in humans. Our patient had pancytopenia. It was unclear whether this was a result of hypersplenism from her cirrhosis or was related to sepsis， as her CT scan failed to demonstrate splenomegaly\n\n【18】E. tarda is a rare human pathogen， but it is a virulent pathogen for fish that causes extensive economic losses in the aquacul-ture industry worldwide.\n\n【19】As a result， the aqua farm industry is currently working toward producing a vaccine against E. tarda for marine life. Recent studies have shown promising results in flounder species uti-lizing immunogenic anti-recombinant outer membrane protein C and anti-E. tarda antibodies generated from the bacterium to yield immunity with an 85% survival rate after inoculation .\n\n【20】Another relevant vaccine is Vibrio， specifically the Vibrio chol-era vaccine. A single-dose， live oral vaccine has been approved by the FDA for the prevention of V. cholera in humans. Since V. cholera and E. tarda have similar bacterial structures， theexisting V. cholera vaccine may provide the groundwork for fu-ture E. tarda vaccine development for use in humans.\n\n【21】Data recovered from the Florida Department of Health show that cases of another similar microbe， V. vulnificus， increased proportionally with increasing water temperature. In 2008， there were 18 cases， and in 2018， there were 42 reported cases of V. vulnificus in Florida alone . Additionally， glob-al sea surface temperature obtained from the Environmental Protection Agency revealed a sustained increase at an aver-age rate of -10℃ per decade . Since there is currently no vaccine for humans， and water temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico continue to rise， it is reasonable to believe that E. tar-da and V. vulnificus infections will correspondingly increase. Hence， the need for an E. tarda vaccine for humans is warrant-ed. Recent advancements in mRNA vaccine technology amid the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have removed several barriers in vaccine development， making this possible. Data need to be collected prospectively regarding the prevalence of E. tarda in-fection to better answer this question. Considering the small number of cases of E tarda infections per year， it is not finan-cially practical to develop a vaccine. Instead， employing clean eating practices is an effective measure to avoid contractingboth V. vulnificus and E. tarda.\n\n【22】Certain liver pathologies resulting in cryptogenic cirrhosis may increase the risk of developing a disseminated E. tarda infec-tion， including but not limited to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis(NASH) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). According to the Centers for Disease Control， obesity rates have increased significantly from 30.5% to 42.4% from 1999/2000 to 2017/2018， respec-tively . With the rate of obesity on the rise， data show a corresponding increase in the prevalence of NASH.Owing to recent advancements in novel antiviral therapies， HCV in-fections have been declining in recent years . It is unclear whether the increase in NASH is correlated with the frequen-cy of E. tarda cases. However， it is clear that having crypto-genic cirrhosis increases the risk of developing serious com-plications， such as septic shock and death， from an E. tarda infection. Another risk factor in the development of dissem-inated E. tarda infection is hemochromatosis and iron over-load. Current research shows that E. tarda growth is stimulat-ed by iron-rich environments. Most strains of E. tarda produce and release an exotoxin known as hemolysin. Hemolysin is ca-pable of lysing red blood cells and breaking down the liberat-ed hemoglobin. E. tarda releases hemolysin extracellularly in iron-depleted environments， suggesting that iron plays a role in the growth of E. tarda . This also demonstrates the cat-alytic effect of iron on E. tarda proliferation.\n\n【23】However， an increase in E. tarda infection may parallel the rise of V. vulnificus infections. V. vulnificus is rare enough to record the number of infections by health authorities only in2008 . V. vulnificus infections in Florida vary yearly and show no correlation with variations in the surface tempera-ture in the Gulf of Mexico. In general， marine pathogens are on the rise in ocean environments . Data on V. vulnificus cases are limited.\n\n【24】Conclusions\n\n【25】E.tarda remains a rare human pathogen， with the most common presentation being gastrointestinal presentation. Extraintestinal manifestations have a serious prognosis and are frequentlyfatal. Thus far， cirrhosis of the liver and iron overload remain the only risk factors for systemic infections. Interestingly， glob-al warming， resulting in increased gulf water temperature，and the increased frequency of liver cirrhosis from NASH， resulting from rising rates of obesity， may explain the increase in report-ed incidence. Additionally， our patient had a unique risk factor that has not been previously reported， advanced lung cancer， and it is not clear if lung cancer is an independent risk fac-tor. The rise in sea water temperature， increased human con-sumption of raw seafood， and increased prevalence of NASH may give rise to an increase in the incidence and mortality of E.tarda in the near future.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The patient presented to the Emergency Department with a severe headache and epigastric pain. Initially receiving a misdiagnosis of functional pain， he continued to experience severe recurrent headaches， most often after urinating or defecating and was re-ferred to our department. Suspecting RCVS， we performed magnetic resonance angiography， which revealed beaded irregularity in the right anterior cerebral and V4 vertebral arteries. The patient also had epigastric pain that coincided with each headache. Electrocardiography revealed pronounced ST-segment elevation in leads and aVL and inverted T wave in lead IIl， while abdominal computed tomography angiography showed narrow-ing of the colic arteries. We named this disease \"reversible systemic vasoconstriction syndrome”(RSVS) as a potential suggested terminology for the future.\n\n【3】Conclusions： RSVS is a clinical syndrome characterized by thunderclap headaches and simultaneous unbearable pain in ex-tracerebral organs. To the best of our knowledge， this is the first case report of RCVS with coronary and colic artery vasospasm. We need to take great care of patients with chest or abdominal pain accompanied by recur-rent thunderclap headaches， since they can be misdiagnosed with functional or psychogenic disorders.\n\n【4】Keywords： Vasospasm， Intracranial·Headache Disorders， Primary·Cerebrovascular DisordersReversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is an acute onset clinical syndrome characterized by recurrent thunderclap headaches (severe pain that peaks in seconds) and diffuse re versible segmental narrowing of at least 2 cerebral arteries. In2007， Calabrese et al  introduced the concept of syndromic reversible cerebral vasoconstriction， a clinical syndrome that was first reported in 1970， and further proposed the diagnostic cri-teria for it. The vasospasm involved in RCVS generally resolves within 3 months and is not associated with primary angiitis of the central nervous system or aneurysmal subarachnoid hem-orrhage . More than half of RCVS cases are thought to occur postpartum or upon exposure to adrenergic and serotonergic drugs . In addition， several cases of RCVS associated with ex-tracerebral vasospasm in the coronary and renal arteries have been reported . However， there are few reports of coronary and abdominal artery vasospasm . Herein， we report a case of RCVS accompanied by coronary and colic artery vasospasm， which we termed， as a potential suggested terminology for the future， “reversible systemic vasoconstriction syndrome\" (RSVS) that manifested as a predictable extracranial vasospasm coin-ciding with cerebral vasoconstriction. To the best of our knowl-edge， this is the first case report of RCVS with coronary artery vasospasm revealed by coincident ST segment changes on elec-trocardiogram (ECG) and colic artery vasospasm visualized on abdominal computed tomography (CT) angiography.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】A 48-year-old man with hypertension and hyperuricemia pre-sented to the Emergency Department (ED) with a sudden-on-set throbbing headache and severe crampy pain in the epigas tric region. He smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 8 years in his twenties but had since quit. He reported drinking 400 mL of Japanese sake every week. Hyperuricemia had been diag-nosed when he was in his forties， and he had been taking 20mg of febuxostat daily for 4 years. He denied taking any oth-er drugs， including cocaine， amphetamines， caffeine， or med-ications that constrict blood vessels.\n\n【7】The current episode began with sudden epigastric pain while washing dishes， followed within 1 min by a severe occipital headache. The intensity of the headache and the epigastric pain was initially described on a numerical rating scale (NRS) score of 5/10， increasing to an NRS score of 10/10 within 30min. The patient described no provoking factors preceding the sudden onset of the pain and no palliative factors. The pain in both areas persisted for 3 to 4 h without fluctuations in intensity. The patient was alert and oriented with a blood pressure of 155/103 mmHg， temperature of 36.3℃， pulse of64 beats per min， respiratory rate of 13 breaths per min， andoxygen saturation of 99% on room air. A physical examination revealed no neurological abnormalities. No nuchal rigidity，ac-centuation of knee jerk， allodynia， or neuralgia was observed. His abdomen was soft， without tenderness on palpation，and bowel sounds were present. No masses， rebound， or guarding were observed. The creatine kinase-myoglobin binding level was 11 U/L， while the troponin T level was 0.008 ng/mL We did not conduct a urine toxicology screen since illicit drugs are extremely hard to obtain in Japan. No obvious ST-T changes were observed on ECG， and no asynergy was seen on echo-cardiography. A CT scan from the head to the pelvis was un-remarkable. The patient was treated with 1000 mg of acet-aminophen，and the pain disappeared a few hours thereafter. Given the normal workup and spontaneous resolution， func-tional pain was diagnosed and he was discharged home.\n\n【8】Upon returning home， the patient’s headache reappeared for 1min during micturition and then resolved before he could take any acetaminophen. On the subsequent day， similar symptoms occurred while the patient was driving， again beginning with sudden epigastric pain， followed by an occipital headache (NRS6/10) that peaked within a few minutes. He returned imme-diately to the ED and was again treated with acetaminophen and monitored， with the pain disappearing within 3 h. Before discharge， he was referred to our outpatient Internal Medicine Clinic for further investigation the following day.\n\n【9】A third episode of headache following epigastric or chest pain occurred again 3 days later while the patient was straining dur-ing defecation， and he returned to the ED. He was alert and oriented with a blood pressure of 150/99 mmHg， tempera-ture of 36.2°℃， pulse of 85 beats per min， respiratory rate of18 breaths per min， and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. Suspecting the presence of vasoconstriction in other organs causing the epigastric pain， we performed abdominal imaging. Abdominal CT angiography revealed narrowing of the right colic and ileocolic arteries . Electrocardiography revealed remarkable ST-segment elevation in leads l and aVL； inverted T waves were observed in lead ⅢII\n\n【10】. The ST elevation was transient， and the elec-trocardiography was normalized 1.5 h after the onset of symp-toms . The creatine kinase-myoglobin binding lev-el was 12 U/L， while the troponin T level was 0.006 ng/mL. Coronary angiography was performed 4 h after the onset ofsymptoms without the use of antithrombotics or aspirin， but no spasm or stenosis of the coronary arteries was observed； moreover， no changes in the caliber of the coronary arteries were noted after nitroglycerin administration.\n\n【11】The differential diagnoses of epigastric pain accompanied by ST-segment changes on electrocardiography， but without ele-vation of cardiac enzymes， include vasospastic angina and un-stable angina pectoris. In this case，the coronary angiography findings were inconsistent with unstable angina pectoris. The absence of stenosis， transient electrocardiography changes， and chest pain strongly suggested ephemeral coronary artery vasospasm consistent with vasospastic angina， although it is one of the diagnostic possibilities since we did not conduct the intracoronary acetylcholine test. We also noted simultaneous vasospasm in the colic arteries， suggestive of RSVS. Other dif-ferential diagnoses of headache included intracerebral hemor-rhage， cerebral venous thrombosis， cervical or cerebral arterial dissection， pituitary apoplexy， and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage， which were ruled out using a cerebral CT scan. We also considered antiphospholipid antibody syndrome， but the activated partial thromboplastin time was 26.7 s， which was within the normal range. We did not measure antiphos-pholipid antibody levels because no findings were suggestive of thrombotic predisposition. We also listed the differential di-agnoses of headache accompanied by chest or abdominal pain. We ruled out giant cell arteritis since he did not have typical signs， such as temporal headache， abrupt onset of vi-sual disturbances， limb claudication， asymmetric blood pres-sures， and jaw claudication. We also ruled out Takayasu arteri-tis since he did not have constitutional symptoms， arthralgias，carotidynia， absent or weak peripheral pulse， limb claudication， arterial bruit， and discrepant blood pressure between arms.\n\n【12】Given that we observed narrowing of the arteries on brain MRA and abdominal CT angiography in addition to changes in the ECG consistent with vasospasm， we assumed that this patient likely had systemic arterial vasoconstriction. Thus， we pursuedtreatment for vasospastic angina in the cerebral， coronary， and colic arteries， prescribing 20 mg of sustained-release nifedipine orally to prevent vasospasm and for blood pressure control， as well as 40 mg of isosorbide dinitrate by patch for antianginal effects and seizure prevention. Nitroglycerin was prescribed for further attacks. At follow-up 2 weeks after coronary angiogra-phy， the patient had only 1 additional attack， which occurred 2days after angiography. During this episode， headache and epi-gastric pain (NRS 6/10) began immediately after defecation. The pain resolved within 30 min after taking nitroglycerin， confirm-ing reversible vasospasm in the colic arteries as the cause of his pain. At follow-up， we increased the dose of sustained-release nifedipine to 40 mg orally. Upon telephone follow-up 2 months after the first dose of nifedipine， he denied experiencing further thunderclap headaches. Nimodipine is commonly used as atreat-ment for RCVS， while calcium-channel blockers in general， such as nifedipine， nimodipine， and verapamil， have been reported to be effective . It should be noted that the patient was start-ed on nifedipine because nimodipine is not available in Japan.\n\n【13】Table 1.

Several case reports have discussed the spec-trum of extracerebral involvement in RCVS . Renal artery vasospasm accompanying RCVS has been described twice pre-viously . In addition， dissection of the internal and exter-nal carotid arteries is associated with RCVS . In a ret-rospective case series of patients with RCVS who underwent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) during ictus ， 17% had signs of wall motion abnormalities； however， ECG data were unavailable. In a case report of a 50-year-old woman with chest pain and thunderclap headache ， elevated serum car-diac enzymes and wall motion abnormalities on TTE indicated coronary artery vasospasm， but no ischemic changes on 12-lead ECG or coronary artery disease on angiography were ob-served. Few reports have been published on coronary artery vasospasm with RCVS ， and this is the first reported case of the sequelae of vasoconstriction captured on ECG despite the fact that no elevation of biomarkers or frank stenosis was observed on coronary angiography. Furthermore， this case re-vealed evidence of narrowing of the colic arteries， which has not been previously described in the literature. However， this case report does not include information on stenosis in oth-er parts of the vascular endothelium because we did not con-duct digital angiography throughout the body， considering its invasiveness. There is still room to consider that symptoms may differ by location.\n\n【17】The pathogenesis of RCVS remains unknown； however， a pre-vious study suggested that triggering cerebral endothelial dysfunction increased vascular tone， and this may contribute to RCVS . We expect a similar etiology to be applicable to blood vessels throughout the body given the evidence of va-soconstriction occurring in extracranial arteries during RCVS ictus. We suspect that the scarcity of studies characterizing RSVS， especially those with cardiac involvement， is due to the fact that patients presenting with headache who have pain in other parts of the body are more likely to be misdiagnosed with other diseases. In this case， functional or psychogenic head-ache was diagnosed on both the first and second visits to the ED before the patient was referred to Internal Medicine， where he was diagnosed with RSVS. Moreover， vasoconstriction in RCVS is typically believed to resolve within 3 months ；how-ever， misdiagnoses may not have been identified since patients may have had to endure symptoms for only a few months. It is necessary to recognize RSVS as part of the RCVS spectrum involving noncerebrovascular vasospasm that may not have been thoroughly addressed or investigated. Furthermore， the symptoms， such as headache， chest pain， and abdominal pain， could repeat again and again in cases of RSVS. More data are necessary to investigate the prevalence and pathogenesis of RSVS. Given that we observed headaches associated with pain in other parts of the body， such as abdominal variants of mi-graine  or cardiac cephalalgia ， such migraines could be derived from the same pathology as RSVS.\n\n【18】RSVS is characterized by cerebral vasoconstriction and simul-taneous systemic vasospasm manifesting as sudden-onset un-bearable pain in a variety of extracerebral organs. Although several cases of RCVS with coronary artery vasospasm have been reported， this is the first case describing simultaneous colic artery vasoconstriction. Patients with chest or abdominal pain due to RSVS， in addition to recurrent thunderclap head-ache， may be at a higher risk of receiving a misdiagnosis of functional or psychogenic headache than those with classic RCVS manifesting as headache alone.\n\n【19】The author is grateful to Takahiro Suzuki and Nobuyuki Komiyama， Department of Cardiology， St. Luke’s International Hospital， for performing the coronary angiography， which en-riched the interpretation of the results， and for providing sug-gestions to improve the clarity of the manuscript.

The most common is NFA-1-neurofibromato-sis type l - peripheral form (Recklinghausen disease) or neurofibromatosis type 2- hearing loss.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】We present the case of a 34-year-old woman. The first changes appeared as soft， pedunculated tu-mours in puberty. In 2009， the patient was admitted to the Dermatology Department in Katowice in order to perform a first complete diagnostic of changes in organs in the course of NFA-1.\n\n【4】Discussion：\n\n【5】On a day of admission， multiple， soft， non-painful， coloured skin-like to brown tumours and nod-ules could be observed on her whole body， and multiple changes were pedunculated. The skin across her entire body was light-olive coloured. The patient described slight itching. Both axillary fossa showed multiple small cafe-au-lait spots. The right side of the trunk showed the presence of a large cafe-au- lait spot. Laboratory tests， imaging， neurological and laryngological consultations showed no deviations from the norm. The ophthalmological examination showed the presence of2 Lisch nodules.\n\n【6】Conclusions：\n\n【7】We describe a case of NFA-1 in the patient， who despite the typical course and appearance of the skin changes， and a positive family history， had not been informed about the likely diagnosis of a genetic syndrome and its resulting consequences.\n\n【8】key words： congenital malformation·genotype· skin\n\n【9】Neurofibromatosis type l is the most common genoderma-tosis-1：3000-5000. It was first described by German pathol-ogist Recklinghausen (von Recklinghausen disease) in 1882. It is an autosomal dominant genetic disease with a known chromosomal localization-17q11.2.\n\n【10】Recklinghausen disease (NFA-1) is caused by a loss of the suppressor gene inhibiting growth and development of tu-mours， resulting in uncontrolled tissue growth .\n\n【11】The complete clinical picture develops in adolescents and adults .\n\n【12】At least 2 out of 7 criteria must be found in order to prop-erly diagnose NF1：\n\n【13】\\- 6 or more cafe- au-lait spots (>5 mm at pre-puberty and>15 mm in adults)，\n\n【14】\\- 2 or more neurofibromas， or l plexiform neurofibroma，\n\n【15】\\- freckling in the axillae or groin (Crowe’s symptom)，- optic glioma，\n\n【16】\\- 2 or more Lisch nodules -hemartoma iris (best observed in a slit lamp)，characteristic bone changes (dysplasia of the sphenoid or thinning of long bone cortex with development of pseu-do-joints or without， scoliosis)，\n\n【17】\\- first degree relative with NF1 .\n\n【18】Disease treatment is mainly symptomatic. Painful plexiform neurofibromas， tumours pressing peripheral nerves and those causing other neurologic symptoms and suspected for becom-ing malignant， should be subjected to surgical removal .\n\n【19】Additionally， the patients should be observed for the presence of complications (tumours in nervous system， optic glioma， vascular problems， increased blood pressure， orthopaedic problems， psychological problems， malignant tumours， such as： chronic myeloid leukaemia， malignant schwannoma).\n\n【20】Routine genetic tests are not necessary in most patients. Prognosis in NFA-1 is differentiated， and intensification of complications can be observed in puberty and during pregnancy .\n\n【21】CASE REPORT\n\n【22】Thirty-four-year-old patient， a tailor. First changes appeared as soft， pedunculated tumours in puberty. Similar， but sin-gle changes could be found on arms of her father and on the trunk of her grand-father. The patient experienced fast progression of changes， and for a time freckling in groins appeared as well as a cafe-au-lait spots on the lateral part of the trunk. The patient has been on a pension since 18 years of age， on the basis of a basic disease. At the age of 26， 2skin changes were removed surgically from the area of nipples. The histopathology confirmed neurofibromas. At age 28the patient underwent natural miscarriage at thellth week. Since this time， she has been under constant gynaecologicaland endocrinological control， due to problems with getting pregnant. The gynaecological and endocrinological tests ex-cluded hormonal and mechanical obstacles.\n\n【23】In 2009， the patient was admitted to the Dermatology Department in Katowice in order to perform a first com-plete diagnostic of changes in organs in the course of NF-1.\n\n【24】On the day of admission， multiple， soft， non-painful， co-loured skin-like to brown tumours and nodules could be observed on her entire body. Multiple changes were pe-dunculated. The skin was coloured light-olive. The patient described slight itching. Both axillary fossa showed multi-ply small cafe-au-lait spots (freckles， so called Crowe's symp-tom). The right side of the trunk showed the presence of a cafe-au-lait spot， 3x2 cm .\n\n【25】Laboratory tests： ESR 5(10， CBC with counts， electrolytes， AspAT， ALAT， GGTP， bilirubin， creatinin， urea， glucose， proteins with electrophoresis， iron level， latex test， Waaler-Rose test， general urine tests were within the normal range.\n\n【26】Tumour markers： CEA and CA 125 were within the normal range. Imaging -X-ray of the chest， shanks， and the hu-meral bone， ultrasonography of the abdomen， CT of the head were normal.\n\n【27】Neurological andlaryngological consultations showed no de-viations from the norm. The ophthalmological examination showed the presence of 2 Lisch nodules within the right iris.\n\n【28】Psychological tests confirmed the marginal intellectual de-velopment of the patient.\n\n【29】The patient was directed for further surgical treatment of the skin changes. Surgical removal of the larger neurofibro-ma， cryotherapy of smaller skin changes and laser therapy of the face changes are planned.\n\n【30】The patient was informed about the necessity of genetic consultation and the risk of the local and general deterio-ration in relation to the planned pregnancy.\n\n【31】DISCUSSION\n\n【32】Recklinghausen disease belongs to the group of famacoses， the syndromes with symptoms found in the skin， nervous system and eye . However， this does not fully describe different NFA-1 symptoms.\n\n【33】The described patient showed 4 out of 7 recognition crite-ria： she has multiple neurofibromas， Lisch nodules (hem-artoma iris)， freckling in the axillae (Crow’s symptom)，and similar familiar changes in father and grand-father.\n\n【34】This is an autosomal dominant genetic disease. Neurofibromin is a protein， which regulates growth fac-tors and oncogenes by a feedback. The gene for neurofi-bromin was described in 1990.Neurofibromin deficiency in NFA causes uncontrolled growth of tumours .\n\n【35】There are no consistent opinions about the influence of parents' age upon the risk of NFA 1 in a child. Bunina et al. showed only a small age difference in the case of fa-thers of children with NFAl. They were on average 1.5 years older than the fathers of healthy children.\n\n【36】Our patient showed no changes within the internal organs upon examination.\n\n【37】Optic glioma is the most common described tumour in the literature in patients with NFA-1.Other， less common ones are： schwannomas， astrocytomas， meningiomas . The presence of an auditory neurofibroma usually suggests the presence of NFA-2. Gupta et al.  described a rare case of a patient with NFA-1 and a recognised adrenal pha-eochromocytoma together with a so-called malignant Triton tumour， consisting of Schwann cells and rhabdomyoblasts.\n\n【38】Ten percent of the patients tested by Overweg-Plandsoen et al. showed optical gliomas， 36% of the patients had macrocephaly and 5% had hydrocephaly.\n\n【39】About 10% of the patients with Recklinghausen disease are mentally retarded ， and about 40% experience problems in learning . Psychological tests in our patient showed only a marginal degree of intellectual development (she graduated from a vocational school).\n\n【40】Lisch nodules， observed in this case， consist of hamarto-matous nevus， representing skin pigmentation changes. Their presence allows for an early diagnosis of NFA-1.Overweg-Plandsoen et al.  estimate that Lisch nod-ules are present in 93% of patients with NFA-1.\n\n【41】Karwacki et al. indicated higher prevalence of congen-ital cataract in this group of patien ts.\n\n【42】More than half of the patients show malformations of mus-cles and bones， such as scoliosis. Some cases also show the presence of pseudo-joints and malformations oflong bones. These anomalies are have usually already been detected in early childhood .\n\n【43】Georgescu et al.  also described rare cases of mandi-ble and maxillary malformations in the course of NFA-1.\n\n【44】Imaging tests excluded bone changes in the described patient.\n\n【45】The endocrine system in patients with NFA is characterised by premature or delayed puberty. Adrenal phaeochromocy-toma can be detected in 1% of patients .\n\n【46】Aged 28， the described patient underwent natural miscar-riage at the 11 week. Since this time， she has been under constant gynaecological and endocrinological control， due to problems associated with getting pregnant. The gynaeco-logical and endocrinological tests excluded hormonal and mechanical obstacles.\n\n【47】The patients with NFA-1 should also be monitored for high blood pressure， due to a higher risk of renovascular hyper-tension in this group of patients .\n\n【48】Abdominal tumours are found in 25% of patients . In most of cases， these tumours consist of cells with low mi-totic activity， which is a good prognostic marker .\n\n【49】Rastogi  described a patient with multiple neurofibro-mas and other benign tumours within the liver， peritonea and stomach.\n\n【50】Recklinghausen disease makes a patient prone to tumour development. Chronic myeloid leukaemia and malignant elephantiasis are most frequently observed. Wilms tumours and rhabdomyosarcomas are also observed .\n\n【51】The disease is treated symptomatically. Plexiform neuro-fibromas， tumours pressing peripheral nerves and those causing other neurologic symptoms and suspected for be-coming malignant， should be surgically removal. Due to a high psycho-social burden， patients with NFA should re-ceive treatments improving their appearance and self-ac-ceptance， such as cryosurgery or laser therapy.\n\n【52】Psychotherapy is also very essential， as well as pharmacolog-ical treatment in the case of psychological disorders .\n\n【53】Genetic and vocational counselling are very important for these patients， since they improve the patient’s’living stan-dard and provide information about the risk of this disease in their children.\n\n【54】The patients should be subjected to a constant oncologic control， due to a significant risk of tumours developing in these patients.\n\n【55】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【56】We described a case of NFA-1 in the patient， who despite the typical course and appearance of the skin changes， and a positive family history， has not been informed about the likely diagn osis of a genetic syndrome and its resulting consequences.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Lymphangioma may develop in the early stage of embryological development or after birth as a result of infection， chronic inflammation， surgery and/or impaired lymphatic circulation.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】We present the diagnostic procedures performed in 7 years old boy with congenital lymphangioma. The child was born with a big right sided lymphangioma of the neck and cheek. At the age of6 the boy was qualified for the surgery and treated in the Department of Paediatric Surgery of Wroclaw Medical University. By the histopathological findings the tumour was diagnosed as lymphangioma. As the child was 7 years old sudden pain of the throat and cheek was reported， it was accompanied by oedema of the right cheek. Physical examination revealed tumour probably deriving form right parapharyngeal space. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance revealed longitudinal fluid structure placed between anterior part of the oral floor and mandibular fossa. The picture reflected lymphangioma. The child was sent to Warsaw for further treatment and is now awaiting for the surgery.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】Lymphagioma are met in children rather not frequently but the case that has been described is interesting because of the course of the disease. The decision to perform surgery was made late， as the tumour was already large. Recurrence of the tumour was probably connected with the infection of upper respiratory airways. Perhaps the development of the new treatment methods will reduce the number of cases qualified for surgical treatment.\n\n【6】Key words： lymphangioma· children\n\n【7】one is specially recommended by some authors as it does not suggest neoplasamtic background and reflects congenital nature of the disturbances . Lymphangioma was reported for the first time in1928 by Redenbacker . Because of the various possible localisation of the tumour， each case of lymphangioma is rather individual and may have dif-ferent symptoms in its course. This is why it seems to be justified to present the case.\n\n【8】CASE REPORT\n\n【9】Seven-years old boy was admitted to the ENT Department of Wroclaw Medical University to di-agnose a tumour localised in the region of the right cheek and middle throat. History of the patient：\n\n【10】The child was born with a big right sided lymph-angioma of the neck and cheek. In the first years of the child’s life the tumour was relatively small so the boy was only observed. But considering that it was growing， in March 2003， as the boy was6 years old， he was qualified for the surgery and treated in the Department of Paediatric Surgery of Wroclaw Medical University. Cystic tumour was totally removed during the surgery. The tumour encompassed： temporal region， part of the cheek， mandibular fossa and partially supraclavicullar fossa. By the histopathological findings the tu-mour was diagnosed as lymphangioma with assist-ing chronic inflammation process \\[M-9179/. Partial peripheral facial nerve paresis occurred after surgery.\n\n【11】In October 2004 the child suddenly reported pain of the throat and cheek accompanied by oedema of the right cheek. The boy was admitted to the ENT Department. Physical examination revealed tumour probably deriving form right parapharyngeal space. The tumour encompassed basal part of the tongue on the right side. Airways were not obstructed. Both soft palate and posterior wall of the throat were unchanged. Blood tests were normal. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance revealed longitudinal fluid structure， 5cm long and 1 cm wide placed between anterior part of the oral floor and mandibular fossa. The tumour sur-rounded the right tonsil from the lateral side and its posterior part adhered to the submandibular gland. The picture reflected lymphangioma. On the right lateral wall of the throat one could notice massive swelling with fluid space that probably emerged after lymhangioma rupture. Left sided neck lym-phatic nodes’ dimensions： 7x15 mm. Right sided neck lymphatic nodes invisible， they were probably removed together with the tumour. There was mas-sive thickening of the right maxillary sinus mucosa. The results are presented on the figure 2.\n\n【12】The child was sent to Warsaw for further treatment and is now awaiting for the surgery.\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n\n【14】Lymphangioma occurs mostly in children with the incidence of 1，2 -2，8 per 1000 persons. They form5，6% of benign tumours in children. Usually only35-50% of lymhangiomas are apparent clinically just after birth， the rest develop about 2 or 3 years of age. The tumour usually looks as soft， white-gray， painless tumour. Most often it is localised in the head and/or neck in the skin， mucosa or soft tis sues， more seldom in inner organs. Jugular triangle， tongue， submandibular space， oral floor， throat and larynx are the most common localisation . The symptoms depend on the localisation and the size of the tumour. The tumours usually grow slowlyand their sudden enlargement may be connected with acute upper respiratory airways infection， trauma or bleeding to the lymhangioma .\n\n【15】Few theories exist on the origin of lymphangioma. It is assumed they develop as a result of improper develop-ment and impaired division of lymphatic structures in the early stage of embryological development. Lymphangioma may occur in patients with some ge-netic disorders with Noon or Down syndromes among them. Some authors sustain they may develop after birth as a result of infection， chronic inflammation， surgery and/or impaired lymphatic circulation .\n\n【16】Traditional classification is based on histopathological picture of lymphangiomas with types distinguished as follows：\n\n【17】1\\. Lymphangioma capillare or simplex composed of capillary lymphatic vessels localised in the epithelium\n\n【18】2\\. Lymphangioma cavernosum composed of broad lymphatic vessels infiltrating surrounding tissues.\n\n【19】3\\. Lymphangioma cysticum - mono or multifocal tumours restrained by endothelium layer， sur-rounded by connective tissue and filled with fluid rich in proteins. They may have large size in new-borns 1，7.\n\n【20】Other criteria distinguish the size of fluid compart-ments in the lymphangioma：\n\n【21】1\\. Macrocystic lesions - the tumour with fluid com-partments bigger than 2 cm3\n\n【22】2\\. Microcystic lesions - the tumour with fluid com-partments smaller than 2 cm3\n\n【23】3\\. Mixed lesions - the tumour with fluid compart-ments of different capacity .\n\n【24】Precisely collected medical history followed by physical ENT examination with endoscopy supple-ment laboratory tests. Radiological diagnostics plays an important role both in prenatal period and after birth. Thanks to ultrasounds lymphangioma may be diagnosed and treated in the neonatal period. The diagnosis may be established as the faetus is 10 weeks old. This diagnostic tool helps to assess the size of the tumour and surounding tissues. Unfortunately mediastinum and parapharyngeal space may not be assessed using this method， this is why Computed Tomography and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance are essential to complete the diagnosis .\n\n【25】Therapeutic procedure is establish for each case in-dividually. If there is essential narrowing of airways， tracheotomy is advised.\n\n【26】Spontaneous regression of the disturbances is ob served in 15% of the cases， but most of the cases need surgical treatment. Aspiration is the oldest pres-ently used method but it is connected with the risk of bleeding， infection and often recurrence.\n\n【27】Surgical resection is usually recommended as basic method of treatment but is connected with high in-cidence of recurrence . Intensive intraoperative bleeding， bacterial infections， neurological distur-bances (Horner and/or Frey syndrome， cranial VII IX and XII nerves paresis) are the most common postoperative complications . Cosmetic malfor-mations are another important matter .\n\n【28】Laser surgery， magnetic resonanse-controlled laser-induced interstinal thermotherapy， somnoplasty-temperature controlled radio frequency volumetric tissue reduction are alternative methods for the clas sical surgery.\n\n【29】New treatment methods of lymphangiomas rely on the local administration of such substances as bleomycinsulfatate ， Ethibloc  or acetic acid  to pro-voke sclerotisation of the lymphatic vessels； immuno-modulative agents such as interferon alfa-2a are also considered . The treatment provides partial or total mass reduction of lymhangioma. Bleomycin sulfatate was effective in 70% of the cases while acetic acid in 66，7% of the patients . Picibanicil， relatively new agent of low general toxicity， seems to be especially helpful in the treatment of lymph angiomas. It is highly effective in lymphangiomaclassified as macrocystic lymphangioma \n\n【30】. Synthesis of growth factors that initiate or inhibit angiogenesis processes seem to be a new challenge in the treatment of lymphangioma .\n\n【31】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【32】Lymphagioma are met in children rather not frequent-ly. The case that has been described is interesting because of the course of the disease. The decision to perform surgery was taken rather late， as the tu-mour was already large. Recurrence of the tumour was probably connected with the infection of upper respiratory airways and sudden enlargement of the tumour with bleeding.\n\n【33】Perhaps the development of the new treatment meth-ods will reduce the number of the cases qualified for surgical treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Odonto-genic cysts arise from odontogenic epithelial components or trapped odontogenic epithelial remnants in bone or gingiva. Non-odontogenic cysts arise from ectoderm involved in the development of facial tissue. The other researchers stated that odontogenic cysts accounted for between 0，8%-45，9% of cysts in the oral cavity. The present study aimed to get data about odontogenic and non-odontogenic cysts characteristics in RSUP Hasan Sadikin Bandung， which could be used as a predisposition factor for oral cysts in West Java. The present descriptive study used a cross-sectional research design and used oral cysts diagnosed patient's medical record in RSUP Hasan Sadikin Bandung from January 2016 to December2019. Computerized results of the research showed that 55，45% of cysts have happened in men； the age of most patients with cysts was 21-30 years old (32，43%). The most common cyst was the radicular cyst (44，59%). The cyst locations of 40patients were found on the mandible and the rest on the maxilla. Based on the present study's data， oral cysts commonly happen in men and mostly happen in adolescents and adults. The most common cyst is the radicular cyst， and cysts are more common in the mandible than in the maxilla.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Odontogenic cyst， non-odontogenic cyst， prevalence.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Various types of benign and malign cysts can influence the max-illofacial complex. Knowledge about epidemiological data of oral lesions is important for a better understanding which con-tributes to correct diagnosis， early treatment， and favourable prognosis. Odontogenic and non-odontogenic cysts are com-mon lesions in the jaw. Odontogenic cysts develop from odonto-genic epithelial components or trapped remnants of odontogenic epithelium in bone or gingiva. Non-odontogenic cysts are ecto-derm cysts that are involved in the development of facial tissue.\n\n【4】These lesions commonly show slow and expansive development and are associated with bone deterioration and recurrences in some cases. Untreated cysts can cause infection， pathological fractures， displacement of teeth involved， and adjacent tooth resorption.'3\n\n【5】Jaw cysts can be classified into odontogenic developmental cysts， inflammatory cysts， and non-odontogenic developmen-tal cysts. Odontogenic developmental cysts consist of gingival cysts in babies， keratosis odontogenic cysts， dentigerous cysts， eruption cysts， gingival cysts in adults， lateral periodontal cysts， odontogenic botryoid cysts， glandular odontogenic cysts， and calcifying odontogenic cysts. Inflammatory cyst consists of radic-ular cysts (apical and lateral)， residual cyst， paradental cyst， and collateral inflammatory cyst. Non-odontogenic developmental cyst consists of midpalatal raphe cyst in baby， nasopalatine duct， and nasolabial cyst\\*.\n\n【6】The demographic profileeof odontogenic\n\n【7】c andnon-\n\n【8】odontogenic cysts has been reported in various age groups\n\n【9】in various countries. These studies showed variations in the characteristics of odontogenic and non-odontogenic cysts. A literature review showed that odontogenic cysts accounted for between 0，8% and 45，9% of the lesions diagnosed in the oral cavity. Some research that has been carried out in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery in various Faculty of Dentistry from various Universities in the world showed the prevalence of oromaxillofacial cysts， especially odontogenic cysts， over the last 15 years period between 0，8-4，9% from all of the accepted specimen namely Mexico 6，7%， Singapore 8%， England 9%， SP Canada and the United States 10-12%， Chili 13%， and Libya14，8%5.\n\n【10】According to Universidade de Pernambuco Brazil  research about the odontogenic cyst， 41，8% of cases occur in ne-groid race， followed by caucasoid race and other races. Other research conducted by the Departement of Oral Pathology， Fed-eral University of Rio Grande do Norte UFRN， Brazil  founded 1019 cases of odontogenic cyst in the Brazillian popula-tion. In addition， there were 197 cases in children (0-16 years). Dentigerous cysts are most common with a frequency of 48，7%and are commonly found in men， followed by radicular cysts43，1% that is commonly found in woman°.\n\n【11】Based on that background， the author is interested in know-ing and further investigating the characteristics of odontogenic and non-odontogenic cysts in the Oral Surgery Medical Staff Group of RSUP Dr Hasan Sadikin， Bandung， West Java Barat. The author chooses Rumah Sakit Umum Pusat Dr Hasan Sadikin as a research place based on the Decree of the Minister of Health No.124/Kes/SK/IV/1978，Rumah Sakit Hasan Sadikin stated as Top Referral Hospital for West Java and the surrounding area.\n\n【12】Research method\n\n【13】This research was a descriptive study with a cross-sectional de-sign using medical record data of patients diagnosed with oral cysts and was done from October to November 2020 in the Oral Surgery Medical Staff Group and Medical Records Installation of RSUP Hasan Sadikin. The target populations of this study were all patients with odontogenic and non-odontogenic cysts in the Oral Surgery Staff Medical Group of RSUP Dr Hasan Sadikin. The accessible populations were part of the target pop-reSPa ulation that the researcher could reach. The accessible popula-tions of this research were patients with an odontogenic and non-odontogenic cyst from January 2016- to December 2019 in the Oral Surgery Staff Medical Group of RSUP Dr Hasan Sadikin. The subject of this research were patients who met inclusion and exclusion criteria with the total sampling technique in January2016 - December 2019 period. The data of this research was taken with this method：\n\n【14】1\\. Ethical Clearance Submission\n\n【15】The research would be done after the researcher has re-ceived an ethical clearance letter from the Research Ethics Committee of UNPAD Medical Faculty or RSUP Hasan Sadikin.\n\n【16】Ethical aspects of this research are identity confidentiality maintained and data from were known only to researchers and will not be published without the consent of the study subjects. Medical record data will be treated with a full sense of responsibility from the collection process until the research is completed. One of the responsibilities was to maintain the confidentiality of the patient's identity， the use of initial when collecting the patient’s name， and only theresearcher that knows about the real identity data in this re-search. If necessary， patient follow-up from medical record data and incurring costs will be borne by the researcher. Activities carried out in order to maintain ethical and con-fidential information about a patient’s disease， that is， the use of medical records for research purposes will be carried out after permission from the authorities of RSUP Hasan Sadikin.\n\n【17】2\\. Data collection from medical records of patients with odon-togenic and non- odontogenic cysts treated by the Oral Surgery Medical Staff Group of RSUP Hasan Sadikin from January 2016 until December 2019 period.\n\n【18】3.TThe data was analyzed computerized to convert the data into information by some steps：(a) Editing is checking the authenticity of required data.\n\n【19】(b) Coding is converting sentences or letters data into numeric data.\n\n【20】(c) Data entry or inserting the data coding of examination results and measurement of the research subiect to the computer program.\n\n【21】(d) Cleaning， if all of the patient's data has been inserted， then it needs to be rechecked to see possibilities of code errors， incompleteness， etc.， then corrected.\n\n【22】(e) The numerical data will be expressed in terms of the standard deviation. Categorical data will be expressed in proportion and percentage (%). If necessary， data analysis can use SPSS.\n\n【23】Result\n\n【24】The result of cyst characteristics data of the patient in the Oral Surgery Medical Staff Group of RSUP Dr Hasan Sadikin in Jan-uary 2016 until December 2019 period obtained as many as 74patients who received treatment. The result of odontogenic and non-odontogenic cyst characteristics in patients in Oral Surgery and Maxillofacial Medical Staff Group RSUP Dr Hasan Sadikin differentiate based on gender， age， types of the cyst， andlocation of the cyst. Gender distribution of cyst cases were 41 (55，4%) men and 33 (44，59%) women .\n\n【25】The result of odontogenic and non-odontogenic cyst charac-teristics in patients in Oral Surgery and Maxillofacial Medical Staff Group RSUP Dr Hasan Sadikin were the majority of pa-tients with cyst were 21-30 years old with the number 24 (32，43%) patients and followed by 31-40 years old patient with the num-ber 12 (16，21%) patients， and then the least patients are 0-10years old， that is 7 (9，45%) patients .\n\n【26】Based on histopathological examination， most patients are di-agnosed with the radicular cyst， as many as 33 (44，59%) patients， followed by dentigerous cyst as many as 27 (36，48%) patients. The fewest cyst found were residual cyst， lateral cyst and erup tion cyst totalling 1(1，35%) patient each .\n\n【27】Based on the location of the cyst， the cyst of 34 patients was located in the maxilla， and 40 patients were located in the mandible. The majority of cysts of the patient were found on dextra maxilla， 11 inflammation cysts， and 11 developmental cysts. Then the least region experienced cyst was anterior max-illa because there were only 2 patient cases .\n\n【28】Discussion\n\n【29】Based on patients' age distribution in figure 3， this research shows that young adults (21-30 years old) and adolescents (31-40years old) have a higher prevalence than the other ages because found a total 36 cases in both ages ranges. This related with third molar growth as a trigger for cyst formation， especially dentigerous teeth on adolescents until adult， according to Su-diono's statement that 37% impacted the third molar mandible and 15% impacted the third molar maxilla and showed radiolu-cent appearance in the pericoronal area that indicated dentiger-ous cyst25，26.\n\n【30】Based on the location of the jaw cyst， 34 cases happen on the maxilla， and 40 cases happen on the mandible. In figure 4.5， cysts in most patients found in dextra mandible， 23 (31，08%) patients， then on anterior maxilla was the region where the least cysts were found because there were only 3 (4，05%) cases in patients. This is in line with research by Bhat et al.， which stated that most odontogenic cysts found in the posterior mandible， because on his research， in 125 cases， 53 (424%) cases were seen in mandible， which is then followed by 41 (32，8%) cases in the anterior maxilla，16(12，8%) in the posterior maxilla， and 12 (9，6%) cases in the anterior mandible19. Mandibular cases are seen more frequentlybecause the cases are related to the growth of the third molar as a trigger for cyst formation， especially dentigerous cysts in adolescents until adult25.\n\n【31】Conclusion\n\n【32】The research about oral cyst characteristics in Oral and Maxillo-facial Surgery Medical Staff Group of RSUP Dr Hasan Sadikin from January 2016 to December 2019 found that oral cysts are mostly found in men than women and often happen from ado-lescent until adult. Based on histopathologic examination， the most commonly found cyst was the radicular cyst， followed by the dentigerous cyst. Oral cysts are also commonly found in the mandible region than the maxilla. This condition might be happening because of relation with the growth of the third molar as a trigger for cysts， especially dentigerous cysts in adolescents until the adult period.\n\n【33】Head and Neck tumours： odontogenic and maxillofacial\n\n【34】bone tumours.

However， the prevalence of aortopathy in HCM patients has not been previously described. A potential relationship between HCM and aortic dilation has not been established and is limited by relatively small patient cohorts.

Nous rapportons le cas d'une patiente de 64 ans qui a ete admise dans notre service de cardiologie pour la prise en charge de la cardiomyopathie hypertrophique obstructive associée a une dilatation anevrysmale de Paorte ascendante.\n\n【2】KEYWORDS Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy， aortic dilation\n\n【3】Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common cardiac ge-netic disorder， affecting 1 out of 500 in the population . It is characterized by hypertrophy of the left ventricle out of pro-portion to what can be explained by other cardiac or systemic diseases. It is a common cause of sudden cardiac death in young people . Familial HCM is inherited in an autosomal dom-inant fashion， and the majority of mutations described are in proteins of the cardiac sarcomere . Dynamic left ventricu-lar outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction is present at rest or withexercise in 70% of HCM patients . Understanding of HCM has increased remarkably in the past several decades due to im-proved imaging quality and evolving genetic links identified by mutations in the cardiac sarcomeric proteins . However， its clinical landscape continues to be diverse and is rapidly chang-ing. Aortic dilation is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S . It is defined based on recent American Society of Echocardiography， and European Association of Cardiovas-cular Imaging published guidelines and using the definition of sinuses of Valsalva or ascending aorta diameter >40 mm for a male or >36 mm for a female.\n\n【4】The pathophysiologic basis of aortic dilation with other dis-eases has been proposed to be either genetic or hemodynamic. However， aortic pathology has recently been described in pa-tients with HCM； common signalling pathways may mediate dilated aorta and HCM \n\n【5】Patient And Observation\n\n【6】We report the case of a 64 years old patient with menopause and hypertension as cardiovascular risk factors and no significant pathological history， in particular， no sudden death in the family. Presented for NYHA stage II dyspnea evolving for 6 months without angina，neither palpitation nor syncope. On clinical ex-amination， she is conscious， hemodynamically and respiratory stable， with blood pressure at 115/65 mmHg symmetrical in the2 upper limbs and a heart rate at 62 bpm， without signs of heart failure with a systolic murmur at 4/6 at the mitral focus and perceived and symmetrical peripheral pulses. The electrocardio gram notes a regular sinus rhythm at 75 bpm， left ventricular hypertrophy with secondary repolarization disorders， and in-complete LBB .\n\n【7】On transthoracic ultrasound， we note an undilated left ventri-cle， hypertrophied with a septum interventricular at 16 mm anda posterior wall at 16 mm， good global and segmental contractil-ity LVEF at 66% with an obstructive septal bulge (Intra LV gradi-ent= 73mmhg)，a dilated left atrium， free of echoes (LA volume at 57 ml/ m-)， a mitral valve seat of a calcification of the large mi-tral valve with severe mitral insufficiency by double mechanism SAM complete and elongation of the anterior leaf with doubt on the rupture of a small cord ， a tricuspid aortic valve seat of an aortic insufficiency minimal without stenosis， ascending aneurysmal aorta in its tubular portion (ascending at55mm)， minimal tricuspid insufficiency estimating systolic blood pressure at 28+3=31 mmHg， RV non-dilated right duct with good longitudinal systolic function (S'VD=12m/s， TAPSE=25mm) and a non-dilated inferior vena cava at 18mm and compliant.\n\n【8】A supplement by transesophageal ultrasound was realized， objectifying a severe mitral insufficiency  by the defect of coaptation and elongation of the anterior sheet with redundant movement and doubt on the rupture of a small cord. Aneurysmal dilation of the ascending aorta (Root=24mm， Si-nus=34mm， Ascending aorta=50mm) and a dilated left auricle with no visible thrombus.\n\n【9】The chest scan， there is significant aneurysmal dilation ex-tending from the aortic root to the proximal part of the arch of the aorta， upstream of the origin of the right subclavian artery， measuring 85\\*76 mm extended over 120 mm associated withmediacalcosis (In the aortic In the ring at 30 mm 2.14cm/m²， Valsalva sinus at 34 mm 2.42 cm/m²， The sino-tubular junction at 35.5 mm 2.53 cm/m²).\n\n【10】The Holter electrocardiogram objectified frequent ventricular extrasystoles and numerous supraventricular extrasystoles.\n\n【11】The patient underwent coronary angiography and a biologi-cal assessment that returned to normal.\n\n【12】The patient was put on 40 mg/day of furosemide and biso-prolol 2.5 mg/day.\n\n【13】After the medico-surgical discussion， our patient underwent Bentall's procedure ； she was followed up in the postoperative period by echocardiography and clinical exami-nation to determine the effectiveness of this procedure. Again， there was a significant improvement in the symptomatic status with good effort tolerance.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】There have been conflicting results regarding the prevalence of aortic dilation in the population. Prior studies were limited primarily to small patient cohorts ranging from only 25-223 pa-tients . Clinical experience in a high-volume HCM centre showed that aortic dilation is common among HCM pa-tients. They found dilation of the tubular ascending aorta in 18%of HCM patients， 7-fold greater than expected in the general population. When using adjusted norms， aortic dilation waspresent in 13%， again more common than expected in the gen-eral population. As demonstrated in patients without HCM，in-creasing age correlated with aortic enlargement >19 mm/m2.To our knowledge， aortic size at the level of the sinuses has not been previously reported in an HCM population. While the aortic disease has not been previously clinically recognized in HCM， a recent study by Boonyasirinant and colleagues showed that aortic stiffness increases in patients with HCM compared with controls as measured by magnetic resonance imaging pulse wave velocity . Vizzardi and al. reported a slightly smaller mean indexed aortic dimension of 16 mm/m²among 25 HCM patients compared to the 16.5 mm/m- reported in this study . When compared to 25 healthy controls， Vizzardi and al. did not find a difference in ascending aortic size. Still， there was a wide standard deviation of +6 mm/m² among HCM patients， reflect-ing the limitation of the small sample size and low power . Gavaller et al. studied 38 patients with HCM. They reported a median non-indexed end-diastolic diameter of 29.5 mm at the as-cending aorta， smaller than the median value of 33 mm observedherein . Gavaller et al. found a larger non-indexed aortic di-mension among HCM patients compared to healthy controls(26.3 mm)， but not when compared to patients with hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy (29.8 mm). Jain et al. evaluated 105HCM patients who echocardiographic measurements of the as-cending aorta (223 studied) and reported a median non-indexed dimension of 34 mm . This finding is similar to the current study. In addition， Jain et al. utilized the CT-derived nomo-gram published by Hannuksela et al. (age-adjusted， non-BSA adjusted) to define aortic dilation and found that 9.5% of these patients met the criteria for aortic dilation. Finally， Yousefzai et al. evaluated 201 HCM patients reporting aortic enlargement defined by age， sex， and BSA-adjusted norms in 9% of subjects， slightly less than reported here . Importantly， these adjusted norms were based on work by Devereux et al.  but did not include adjusted norms for the mid-ascending aorta recently reported by Ayoub et al. ， an important distinction as in this study， the location of aortic dilation was primarily noted at the tubular level (71% of cases of dilation above-adjusted norms).\n\n【16】The tubular ascending aorta was not well visualized in a sub-stantial portion of the population， limiting definitive conclusions about this segment of the aorta. However， the ascending aorta in a smaller cohort of HCM patients is similar in size compared to controls . Furthermore， similar to the aorta at the sinuses of Valsalva，no clinical parameters specific to HCM were associated with dilation of the ascending aorta.\n\n【17】That observation raises the possibility of an association be-tween two diverse entities. It leads to questions regarding their pathophysiological and/or genetic association. This association was speculated to result from a number of mechanisms， includ-ing intrinsic aortic fibrosis in HCM，neurohormonal disturbance， endothelial dysfunction， or abnormal left ventricular barorecep-tor response . Interestingly， previous studies have shown a role of TGF-beta in the development of fibrosis and hypertrophy in HCM J. TGF-beta also has an important association with the development of aortic aneurysms and dissection . However， TGF-beta involvement in HCM may only be related to regional overexpression in the myocardium， in a mechanism independent of its involvement in aortic disease . It is well known that altered flow dynamics through a morphologically abnormal aortic valve change the spatial velocity gradients and thus create a shear stress stimulus on the aortic walls that alters gene expression and promotes endothelial remodelling. Similar flow dynamics in patients with obstructive HCM， or alterations in the spatial velocity gradients in the hypertrophied pathologic left ventricle in patients with obstructive and non-obstructive HCM， might contribute to aortic dilation in these pa-tients. These hemodynamic factors might be more pronounced in patients with intrinsic weakness of the aortic wall， especially in those with a genetic predisposition or other comorbidities contributing to the aortic disease. Given a higher prevalence of LVOT obstruction (72.2% vs 59.0%) in patients with aortic dilation in Yousefzai and al.， even though not statistically signif-icant， it appears plausible that hemodynamic alterations might be an etiopathogenetic factor for aortic dilation . The mecha-nism of most aortopathies has been ascribed to dysregulation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-b)， which causes weak-ening and disordering of elastic fibre formation in the aortic wall， leading to aortic dilation； expression of the TGF-b gene is enhanced in patients with HCM. IGF-I and TGF-beta signals may be further amplified by increased receptor numbers on cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts . Thus， these geneticand molecular alterations， which can activate similar pathways， might explain， to some extent， the higher prevalence of aortic dilation in HCM patients. However， this needs to be proved further. This hypothesis was recently put to the test by Vizzardi and al. and showed impaired distensibility and stiffness of the aorta in HCM patients compared to the control group.In Yousefzai and al study， 2 out of 5 patients (40%) with HCM and aortic dilation who were tested for TAAD gene tested positive for mutation； however， the true genetic links between HCM and aortic dilation remain unknown because of the small sample group . This unique subset of patients with concomitant HCM and aortic dilation could be at higher risk for adverse events， including the risk of aortic aneurysm. The concept of the cause of obstruction changes from early ideas that a muscular outflow tract sphincter was the cause， through the discovery of systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflet， to the current understanding that flow drag， the pushing force of flow， is the dominant hydrodynamic mechanism for SAM. Accordingly， the continuing redesign and modification of surgical procedures to relieve outflow obstruction have corresponded to ideas about the cause of this condition.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】It is important to assess the exact prevalence of this association via a collaborative effort across institutions. Careful and detailed evaluation of HCM registry patients might help us understand the association of HCM and aortic dilation in large populations in order to gain insights into the clinical outcomes of the pa-tients in whom these entities coexist and understand the genetic， molecular， and hemodynamic interplay that might alter the phe-notypic expression and clinical course of these patients in order to determine the appropriate surveillance and monitoring.\n\n【20】Abbreviation\n\n【21】BSA ： Body Surface Area\n\n【22】HCM ： Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy\n\n【23】IGF-1 ： Insulin-like Growth Factor 1\n\n【24】LA ： Left Atrium\n\n【25】LV ： Left Ventricular\n\n【26】LVEF ： Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction\n\n【27】LVOT ： Left Ventricular Outflow Tract\n\n【28】NYHA ： New York Heart Association\n\n【29】SAM ： Systolic Movement of the Anterior mitral valve\n\n【30】TAAD ： Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms and Dissection\n\n【31】TGF-B ： Transforming Growth Factor Beta\n\n【32】U.S ： United Stat", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

These types of neoplasms are more common in the elongated bones， pelvis， and ribs. Chondrosarcoma is a rare type of cancer that usually begins in the bones but can sometimes occur in the soft tissue near bones. Only 6%-10% are known to occur in the spine . Magnetic Resonance Imaging (RMI) of the cervical spine shows an encapsulated， well-defined mass located at the left parapharyngeal space， with contact with the lateral cervical spine . Most occur in the thoracic spine. Cervical CHS\n\n【4】A 30- year- old man presented with painless progressive left-sided neck swelling for 1 year. No family history of head or neck tumours or vascular abnormalities. The clinical examination found the patient in good general condition. On examination， a7x4 cm， non-tender， hard， fixed swelling was palpable in the left supraclavicular area and extending to mandibular angle—no inflammatory signs or pain on palpation. The neurological exam was normal. No cervical lymph node was noted. The somatic ex-amination was unremarkable. Laboratory blood tests are normal. MRI of the cervical spine shows an encapsulated， well-defined mass located at the left parapharyngeal space， with contact with the lateral cervical spine. This mass presented a mixed intensity on T1-W， showing iso and hypersignal intensity. This lesion showed intense enhancement after infusion of contrast. On T2-W images， hypersignal involve the left cervical intervertebral foramen of the cervical C3-C4 and C5. The spinal cord was in-tact. No intracranial was documented. No signs of invasion ofadjacent structures or intracranial extension were observed. The patient underwent surgery with a teamwork (ENT and neuro-surgeon) team. A vertical pre sternocleidomastoidian incision was made. Some Great vessels were seen on the tumour capsule and coagulated by bipolar electrocoagulation. Meticulous sharp dissection after vascular control， the tumour was removed in Toto. The tumour was firm and cartilaginous in consistency in the macroscopical section. The Postoperative was favourable. Histological study showed a proliferation cartilaginous matrix by neoplastic cells. The final diagnosis was low-grade CHS. No complication was noted. The patient has been referred to the oncology center for adjuvant therapy.\n\n【5】Chondrosarcoma (CHS) is a malignant neoplasm characterized by the formation of a cartilaginous matrix by neoplastic cells， with a high propensity for local recurrences. Chondrosarcoma range from low-grade tumours with low metastatic potential to high-grade， aggressive tumours characterized by early metasta-sis.  Long bones， ribs， shoulder， and pelvic girdles are com-mon locations for CHS and only 6%-10% are known to occur in the spine. J. Most occur in the thoracic spine. Cervical CHS is very rare. It can present as a primary tumour or may develop as a secondary tumour in an already preexisting benign cartilaginous lesion. Chondrosarcoma is a rare type of cancer that usually begins in the bones but can sometimes occur in the soft tissue near bones. In our case， a tumour was seen arising from the cervical transverse of the 3rd to 6th cervical spine. The parapharyngeal space was respected. Our case appears origi-nally from the lateral cervical spine， spreading in the neck and sternocleidomastoidian region. Most of the spinal CHS occur in the thoracic spine followed by the cervical region and are relatively rare in the lumbar vertebra. However， they can arise from the body and posterior elements of the vertebral column. Strike SA and al.  reported 16 cases of CHS in the spine. The cervical spine was involved in four cases. He reported and analyzed the major series of CHS in the literature. Chondrosar-comas can be classified into the following three histologic grades， depending on findings of cellularity， atypia， and pleomorphism. According to the WHO classification， Grade I chondrosarcoma or atypical cartilaginous tumour is grouped under locally aggres-sive (intermediate) cartilaginous tumours. In contrast， Grade II and Grade III chondrosarcomas and Clear cell， mesenchy-mal， and dedifferentiated subtypes are classified as malignant chondrogenic tumours . Grade III is Characterized by high cellularity， prominent nuclear atypia， and the presence of mitosis. The higher the grade， the more likely the tumour is to spread and metastasize. The higher the grade， the more likely the tumour spreads and metastasises. Grade I lesions rarely metastasize， whereas 10-15% of grade IIlesions and more than 50% of grade II lesions metastasize.  The most commonly reported symp-toms of cervical spinal chondrosarcomas include pain， swelling， sensory and motor deficits resulting from spinal brachial plexus or spinal cord compression， and pathological fractures. In cer-vical X-rays， Calcifications can be visible in the matrix tumour. Flaky calcifications in \"popcorn\" are the most typical. CT shows a lobulated lesion containing lump or diffuse calcifications with areas of new bone formation . MRI remains very useful for determining the tumour's exact location and its relationship with adjacent structures， neryous and vascular. Angio-IRM can detect vascular compression. MRI shows a low-intensity signal on T1 weighted images and heterogeneous low and high signal intensity on T2 weighted images. However， the aspect MRI of chondrosarcoma is not specific and discusses other tumours， in-cluding chondroma， aggressive osteoblastoma， osteochondroma， osteosarcoma. In addition， arteriography can show the vascular-ization of the tumour， and embolization can be performed before the surgery in some cases J.Management： Chondrosar-coma treatment usually involves surgery. The literature suggests that gross-total removal of the CHS provides the best chance for prolonging the disease-free interval in patients. Therefore， subtotal excision should be avoided whenever possible. Cervi-cal spinal CHS surgery is critical； it should aim to preserve and possibly improve the spine’s functionality， relieve pain， and con-trol local tumour recurrence， which promises a longer survivalrate. Owing to its proximity to vital neurovascular structures and combined with the complex spinal anatomy (vascular， ner-vous， and paraphernal space)， Chondrosarcoma of the cervical spine poses difficulties about the surgical procedures performed， and the majority of these lesions cannot be excised in an ideal en bloc manner. When cervical spine instability is noted， an instrumented fusion must stabilize the spine. A combined ante-rior and posterior approach are sometimes necessary to achieve complete resection of chondrosarcoma and cervical fusion. Adjuvant radiotherapy has a limited role and may be useful in situations with incomplete surgical margins or palliation. CHS is considered to be radiation resistant. Conventional radiotherapy did not affect the outcomes. Chemotherapy has not been of any proven benefit and hence not recommended. Chondrosarcoma cell lines， as well as primary tumours， are variably radioresistant. Therefore， for high-grade tumours， partially resected tumours， and patients who do not accept surgery or palliative treatment， adjuvant radiotherapy may be recommended. Pro-ton-beam therapy was used with some good results. Demizu， Yusuke et al.  demonstrated that Proton beam therapy is safe and effective for treating bone sarcomas， including CHS of the skull base and spine in Japan. The possibility of metastasis corre-lates with poor prognosis inducing malignancy grade. However， the prognosis of spinal chondrosarcoma is relatively good， with a 5-year survival of 90 % for grade 1， 81 % for grade 2， and 43 %for grade 3 tumours .\n\n【6】Conclusion\n\n【7】Chondrosarcoma must be considered as a diagnosis differential of any deep-seated neck tumefaction near the cervical spine.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Each year， around 123 000patients with DVT visit Emergency Departments (EDs) in the US， and this number is increasing . Patients with DVT can present in many ways， including with pain， erythema， swell-ing， or numbness， although these symptoms can sometimes be difficult to detect . An unusual development of DVT was documented in the literature， in which a young male patient developed DVT 4 months after collateral ligament reconstruc-tion surgery . The risk of developing DVT is related to ve-nous stasis， hypercoagulability， or endothelial injury. Diagnosis of DVT starts with pre-test probability estimation， according to the gestalt of an experienced clinician， in conjunction with D-dimer and venous ultrasound. Late diagnosis of DVT can lead to multiple comorbidities， the most lethal of which is pulmo-nary embolism (PE). Unilateral foot drop mostly results from neurologic， muscular， or traumatic causes， and there are no previous reports of DVT patients presenting with foot drop in the literature. Therefore， the purpose of this case report is to present the unusual presentation of DVT as foot drop in a mid-dle-aged man with no clearly identifiable risk factors for DVT.\n\n【8】Our case study concerns a 54-year-old， otherwise symptom-free male who had been a smoker for 30 years， with a previ-ous history of stab wound to the left upper quadrant of the abdomen and the right thigh back， from when he was work-ing in the military. The patient’s BMI was 25.53 kg/m2. The pa-tient presented to the ED complaining of pain in the left leg， which had started suddenly 2 days earlier， right after he woke up from sleep. It was initially only pain， which then escalated to weakness and decreased sensation in the foot. According to the patient， the pain radiated to the knee and worsened when he put weight on it. When the weakness started， he was able to walk on it with limping； however， upon his presenta-tion to the ED， he stated that his left leg was completely weak.\n\n【9】The patient denied having pain on the right leg or back. There was no history of trauma， fall， recent surgery， recent long trav-el trips， or weight loss. There was no family history of similar complaints or coagulation-related diseases. Also， the patient de-nied any history of fever， insect bite， nausea， vomiting， diarrhea， dysuria， hematuria， alcohol use， or use of any other illicit drug.\n\n【10】Upon examination， the patient’s vitals were grossly stable.

Upon examina-tion， he lay on the bed with a palpable peripheral pulse， and his chest was clear with equal bilateral air entry and no add-ed sound. Back examination was unremarkable for tenderness. and the patient had an intact rectal tone with no saddle anes-thesia. Further examination of the skin for any redness， swell-ing， needle pricks， bites， or wounds was also unremarkable. Neurological examination showed left lower motor weakness of 3 out of 5， associated with foot drop when compared with the right side， which was 5 out of 5. Lower limb sensory ex-amination showed decreased sensation in the left lower foot when compared with the right at the level of the ankle and below with no distinct dermatomal distribution. Knee reflex was examined， and was found to be normal. Ankle reflex was not examined. The upper motor and sensory functions were normal. The cerebellar exam was unremarkable， except that he limped while walking due to his inability to put weight on his left lower leg.\n\n【15】The patient's laboratory test results  were unremark-able. Considering these results， we saw no obvious cause for the weakness， so a point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) was car-ried out by an emergency physician. The POCUS showed the possibility of non-compressible veins in the left lower leg. As the patient had a modified Wells score of zero， a D-dimer was measured. Despite the unorthodox presentation， it returned as1.35， so a DVT ultrasound scan was carried out， which showed thrombi in the left external iliac and common and superficial femoral veins. The left popliteal， posterior tibial， and proximal greater saphenous veins were patent， as shown in Figures 1-3. The patient was admitted to the general ward for observation， and enoxaparin 70 mg twice daily was initiated. Laboratory tests investigating a hypercoagulable state came back nega-tive. Hematology was consulted， and they recommended that the patient be followed in the clinic after repeating the labora-tory tests， to follow the course of the illness. After around 10days， the patient was discharged on apixaban， free of symp-toms， including foot drop.\n\n【16】However， 40 days later， the patient presented to the ED com-plaining of right lower chest pain， pleuritic in nature， with a heart rate of 115 bpm and an electrocardiogram (ECG) show-ing sinus tachycardia with S1Q3T3. The patient’s laborato-ry test results and symptoms， in combination with a recent DVT diagnosis， warranted a CT chest study to rule out PE. The study was positive， showing right segmental and sub-segmental PE， even though the patient reported good com-pliance with apixaban. Neurological symptoms did not recur， and no leg swelling or weakness was evident after the initi-ation of the therapy.\n\n【17】The present study reports a unique presentation of DVT in the form of foot drop in a middle-aged man with an absence of known risk factors. Great emphasis should be placed on neuro-logical causes when encountering a patient with unilateral limb weakness， but a compressive cause must also be considered.\n\n【18】DVT presentation varies significantly between patients； the usual presentation of DVT is unilateral leg swelling， pain， and warmth. However， subtle changes that are challenging to ob-serve clinically can make diagnosis difficult. In one study of DVT ， leg swelling was found to have a sensitivity of 97%and a specificity of 33%， whereas pain had a sensitivity of86% and a specificity of 19%. In addition， the study found warmth to have a sensitivity of 72% and a specificity of 48%. These were the most common signs of DVT， and， as shown in that study， they were not very specific. Furthermore， DVT presentation is usually confined to 1 leg， but bilatera! DVT can also be present. Other signs observed in DVT presen-tation include dilated superficial veins or tenderness over the calf muscles . Another sign reported is Homan’s sign， which is calf pain reproduced by ankle dorsiflexion， but it is also unreliable in the diagnosis of DVT. Other severe forms of DVT presentation are proximal DVT causing phlegmasia alba dolens， which is a swollen， painful， and pale or white limb， and phlegmasia cerulea dolens， which is a limb that is dusky or blue in color.\n\n【19】Unusual risk factors have been reported in the literature. Chandur et al reported on a patient who developed DVT a few days after taking a COVID vaccine . Another case report pre-sented the story of a patient who had DVT， and a few weeks later， developed neurological symptoms. After investigations， he turned out to have a cobalamin deficiency . Our patient in this study presented with foot drop， and after initial inves tigations were negative， except for D-dimer， a POCUS was car-ried out by an experienced emergency medicine physician to exclude a compressive cause； in this case， thrombus， as arte-rial pulses were palpable. The POCUS showed non-compress-ible veins， which led us to order an official ultrasound， which confirmed thrombosed veins. The presentation of foot drop in our patient was therefore due to a compressive pathology along the deep peroneal nerve， the common peroneal nerve， or the sciatic nerve.\n\n【20】Conclusions\n\n【21】A compressive cause， although rare， must be excluded when encountering unilateral lower limb weakness without a neu-rologically clear cause. Therefore， POCUS is a valuable tool in the evaluation of acute unilateral lower limb weakness.\n\n【22】All figures submitted have been created by the authors who confirm that the images are original with no duplication and have not been previously published in whole or in part.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Agranulocytosis is an infrequent complication of this antibiotic， postu-lated in its genesis a mechanism immune-mediated by antineutrophil antibodies and antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA). Treatment includes discontinuing vancomycin， and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor administration.\n\n【2】Case Report： We present the case of a patient who developed agranulocytosis secondary to vancomycin during the treat-ment of an infectious endocarditis， which was reversed when the antibiotic was stopped. Concomitantly to neutropenia， he had ANCA positivity， which subsequently became negative.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】Agranulocytosis induced by vancomycin is infrequent and generally occurs after day 12 of treatment. In most cases， like in our case， it is caused by an immune-mediated mechanism. More studies are needed to determine the pathogenic mechanism and the ANCA role in this adverse effect.\n\n【5】MeSH Keywords： Agranulocytosis · Antibodies， Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic ·Vancomycin\n\n【6】Agranulocytosis means the absence of granulocytes， although this term is often used to indicate severe degrees of neutrope-nia . It can be linked to several causes and drug-induced agranulocytosis is a serious adverse event . Among non-cytostatic drugs， some antibiotics can cause agranulocytosis， with a mortality of 5-10%.\n\n【7】Vancomycin was isolated from Streptomyces orientalis on the island of Borneo by Kornfield. In 1958， in the absence of an ef-fective alternative， vancomycin was immediately approved for clinical use . Vancomycin has been used for decades to treat infections by Gram-positive bacteria， particularly those caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).\n\n【8】The first 2 reports of vancomycin-induced agranulocytosis were published by Dangerfield and colleagues in 1960， shortly af-ter the introduction of vancomycin into clinical practice . The pathogenesis of this complication has not been elucidat-ed. The available data support the hypothesis of a peripheral mechanism mediated by antibodies and direct toxicity to the bone marrow .\n\n【9】We present the case of a patient with a diagnosis of infective endocarditis treated with vancomycin who developed agranu-locytosis， with positivity of antineutrophil cytoplasm antibod-ies (ANCA) simultaneous to neutropenia.\n\n【10】Case Report\n\n【11】A 38-year-old male patient， with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 without treatment， was admitted for an abscess in the right kidney. The abscess was drained， and a culture of the sur-gical material was obtained， and a blood culture growth iden-tified MRSA with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to vancomycin of 1 ug/mL. Intravenous vancomycin was started.\n\n【12】At admission the patient’s serum glycemia was 135 mg/dL， glycosylated hemoglobin 7%， and serum sodium， potassium， creatinine， and urea were normal.\n\n【13】A transesophageal echocardiogram showed a mobile homoge-neous mass with regular edges of 10x7 mm compatible with vegetation on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve. With the diagnosis of infective endocarditis on a native mitral valve， he continued with vancomycin. Measurements of plasmatic vancomycin levels were： 20 ug/mL， 15 mcg/mL and 15 mcg/mL， with 4.5 grams and 4 grams per day of vancomycin， respectively.\n\n【14】The evolution was favorable， without cardiovascular compli-cations and the control blood cultures were negative on the third day of antibiotics. On day 28 of treatment， a decrease in neutrophil count was detected. Neutropenia was progressive and accentuated on days 30 and 31 up to a value of 60 neu-trophils per mm and no changes in the monocyte count was observed . The medications used in the patient were vancomycin， prophylactic sodium heparin， omeprazole， insu-lin， and paracetamol.\n\n【15】Due to the possibility of neutropenia induced by drugs， the Naranjo algorithm was applied， which showed a proba-ble adverse effect (7/10) in favor of vancomycin. The periph-eral blood smear showed absence of granulocytes ， and the bone marrow examination showed normality of the precursors of the 3 series.\n\n【16】During neutropenic period， atypical positive ANCA (title 1/80) was detected by indirect immunofluorescence. Vancomycin was changed to daptomycin and 2 subcutaneous doses of granulo-cyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) at 60 MU was indicat-ed. The granulocyte count was normalized on the second day of vancomycin withdrawal. Two months after the event， the ANCA determination was negative.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】Drug-induced agranulocytosis is a serious entity that im-plies an increased risk of infections . Agranulocytosis or se-vere neutropenia is defined by an absolute neutrophil count<500/mm³. In Europe， the annual incidence of drug-in-duced agranulocytosis ranges from 1.6 to 9.2 cases per mil-lion population . Mortality rates of agranulocytosis inducedby non-chemotherapeutic drugs were reported up to 16% in a retrospective review. In cases of agranulocytosis caused by antibiotics， mortality reported is around 5%.\n\n| Cells/mm²  | Days of treatment  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cells/mm²  | Day 1  | Day 13  | Day 23  | Day 26  | Day 28  | Day 30  | Day 31  | Day 33  |\n| Leucocytes  | 14.890  | 10.200  | 6.310  | 3.990  | 4.580  | 3.790  | 3.700  | 8.140  |\n| Neutrophils  | 12.120  | 7.750  | 3.670  | 1.780  | 620  | 210  | 60  | 4.780  |\n| Lymphocytes  | 1.790  | 1.520  | 1830  | 1.430  | 3.080  | 2.370  | 2.300  | 2.180  |\n| Monocytes  | 890  | 880  | 700  | 780  | 850  | 1.190  | 1.340  | 1.180  |\n\n【20】Despite an extensive list of medications that cause neutrope-nia， only propylthiouracil， methimazole， cocaine/levamisole， minocycline， and hydralazine were associated with ANCA and neutropeniaVancomycin is used to treat MRSA infections and patients with penicillin allergy.， several weeks of therapy with this antibiotic are required in infections such as endocardi-tis and chronic osteomyelitis .The adverse reactions to vancomycin include fever， red man syndrome， nephrotoxici-ty， ototoxicity， and rarely neutropenia. Retrospective analyses in hospitalized patients have estimated that the incidence of vancomycin induced neutropenia is 2%.\n\n【21】In a retrospective study that included 114 patients treated with vancomycin， 3.5% had severe neutropenia， and this was presented on day 26 (±15 days) after the start of treatment. There was no association between the total dose of vanco-mycin and its serum concentrations with the development of neutropenia . In a review by Black et al.  and in a review by Segarra-Newnham and Tagoff ， vancomycin-induced neutropenia was associated with a therapy lasting more than7 days， with most cases appearing after day 20 of treatment. The neutrophil count normalizes， usually， in the first week af-ter the suspension of vancomycin .\n\n【22】The specific mechanisms behind the development of this com-plication have not been fully elucidated， although the hypoth-eses include immune-mediated neutropenia and direct toxicity of bone marrow . The development of antineutrophilantibodies， and more rarely ANCA supports the immune origin of agranulocytosis by drugs .\n\n【23】However， the direct role of the ANCA in the development of neutropenia is not entirely clear. The migration of cytoplasmic antigens proteinase 3 (PR3)， myeloperoxidase (MPO)， and ca-thepsin G to the neutrophil cell surface promoted by endoge nous pyrogens， allow exposure to the immune system . Other mechanisms possibly involved are suppression of granu-locytes production， complement dependent cytotoxicity，and ag-glutination of neutrophils by antineutrophil antibodies \n\n【24】Akamizu et al. performed in vitro cytotoxicity tests in serum of a patient with neutropenia and ANCA positive secondary to propylthiouracil， demonstrating that ANCA lysed neutrophils through a complement-dependent mechanism but not by an-tibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity \n\n【25】Grayson et al. reported a case of vasculitis ANCA-associated autoimmune neutropenia with specificity against PR3 and MPO. They found only 24 cases in the literature of neutrope-nia associated with ANCA secondary to drugs， none of which was vancomycin .\n\nAs for the direct bone marrow cytotoxic effect， there are also arguments against it， such as the time it takes to develop neutropenia induced by vancomycin and the lack of a dose dependent effect on the neutrophi! count . In addition， the rapid recovery of neutrophils after stopping the drug or administering G-CSF suggests that the myeloid bone marrow precursors are intact|14.\n\n【27】In our case， there was no mechanism of bone marrow toxicity due to the presence of normal myeloid precursors in bone mar-row examination. We believe that ANCA may have intervened in agranulocytosis， since they were detected during neutrope-nia and not after vancomycin suspension. The rapid recovery of granulocytes after the suspension of the antibiotic is an el-ement in favor of vancomycin as a causative agent . The application of a method that considers causality of an ad-verse drug reaction， such as the Naranjo algorithm， is a use-ful and simple tool for these cases .\n\n【28】As part of the treatment of agranulocytosis， G-CSF can be used since it shortens the duration of neutropenia and implies few-er risks of infections and fatal complications .\n\n【29】Regarding the antibiotic scheme， European and American guide-lines for infective endocarditis recommends daptomycin as an alternative to vancomycin .\n\n【30】The agranulocytosis induced by vancomycin is a known but infrequent adverse effect this drug. Usually it occurs after day12 of treatment. In our case， like in most reported cases， it is caused by an immune-mediated mechanism and among the possible immune mechanisms involved ANCAs could have a pathogenic role. However， there are few previous reports that link ANCA with vancomycin-induced agranulocytosis. More studies are needed to determine the pathogenic mechanism of agranulocytosis mediated by ANCA.\n\n【31】The treatment of agranulocytosis by vancomycin involves the suspension of this antibiotic and the administration of an al-ternative agent， together with G-CSF administration. It is rec-ommended to monitor the hematological parameters at least once a week in patients receiving prolonged intravenous van-comycin therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

CRP， by activating the classical complement pathway and inter-acting with macrophages via Fc gamma receptors， can cause pulmonary inflammation with subsequent fibro-sis. Recently we have reported first-in-man CRP apheresis in a \"high-risk” COVID-19 patient. Treatment was unfortunately clinically unsuccessful. Here， we report on successful CRP apheresis treatment in a \"lower-risk”COVID-19 patient with respiratory failure.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 39-year-old male patient suffering from fatigue， dyspnea， and fever for 4 days was referred to us. The pa-tient had to be intubated. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of a throat smear revealed SARS-CoV-2infection. Mutation analysis revealed the VOC B. 1.1.7 variant. CRP levels were 79.2 mg/L and increased to161.63 mg/L. Procalcitonin (PCT) levels were continuously normal (<0.5 ng/ml). Antibiotic therapy was start-ed to avoid bacterial superinfection. CRP apheresis was performed once via central venous access. CRP levels declined from a maximum of 161.63 mg/L to 32.58 mg/L. No apheresis-associated adverse effects were ob-served. Subsequently， CRP plasma levels declined day by day and normalized on day 5. The patient was extu-bated on day 5 and discharged from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) on day 6. A second low CRP peak (maximum22.41 mg/L) on day 7 remained clinically inapparent. The patient was discharged in good clinical condition with a CRP level of 6.94 mg/L on day 8.\n\n【4】Conclusions： SARS-CoV-2 infection can induce an uncontrolled CRP-mediated autoimmune response of ancient immuni-ty. In this patient， the autoimmune response was potently and successfully suppressed by early selective CRP apheresis.\n\n【5】Keywords： Blood Component Removal ·C-Reactive Protein·COVID-19l Cardiovascular Center Oberallgaeu-Kempten， Clinic Association Allgaeu， Kempten， Germany2 Pentracor GmbH， Henningsdorf， Germany3 Medical Care Center Kempten-Allgaeu，Kempten， Germany4 Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine， Clinic Association Allgaeu， Immenstadt， Gemmany5 Department of Gastroenterology/Infectiology/Rheumatology. Charite University Medicine Berlin， Berlin， Germany6 Department of Pneumology Thoracic Oncology， Sleep-，and Respiratory Critical Care Medicine， Clinic Association Allgaeu， Kempten， GemmanyC-reactive protein (CRP)， the typical human acute-phase pro-tein， was probably the first antibody-like molecule in the evo-lution of the immune system . Evolutionarily， CRP appeared earlier than antibodies and was， for example， already expressed in ancient Limulus polyphemes . CRP partly utilizes the same biological structures： like antibodies， the molecule activates complement via C1q  and opsonizes biological particles via Fc gamma receptors . CRP may be considered as an ata-vism in the human immune system . For human medicine， it is important to note that CRP， like antibodies， can cause (se-vere) autoimmune reactions in various human diseases .\n\n【6】Based on these observations， we hypothesized in 2020 that CRP， in SARS-CoV-2 infection， can induce an uncontrolled CRP-mediated autoimmune response of ancient immunity . In other words， CRP may be a central effector molecule in this potentially life-threatening disease. This scientific hypothe-sis is supported (but certainly not proven) by the established strong association between high CRP levels and poor progno-sis in COVID-19 disease . Subsequently， other authors have speculated on a causal connection .\n\n【7】The only way to prove or disprove such a hypothesis may be to use selective CRP inhibitors in controlled clinical trials . To date， CRP apheresis  is the only effective (and legal-ly approved) method to selectively eliminate CRP from human plasma. In 2020， we performed the first-in-man CRP apheresis in COVID-19 disease， in a\"high-risk\"(72-year-old， multimorbid， advanced-stage) patient . Although we observed promis-ing signals， treatment was (for various reasons discussed in the original report ) clinically unsuccessful.\n\n【8】Here， we report on the second COVID-19 patient we treated by CRP apheresis. This time， we have successfully treated a“lower-risk” (39-year-old， moderately hypertensive， early-stage) COVID-19 patient with respiratory failure.\n\n【9】Case Report\n\n【10】A 39-year-old man suffering from cough， breathlessness， and fever for 4 days was referred to the Emergency Unit of Immenstadt Hospital， Clinic Association Allgaeu， Germany. His history of concomitant diseases only included moderate arte-rial hypertension. Rapid antigen testing revealed SARS-CoV-2positivity. Arterial oxygen saturation (SO，) at admission was88% with 10 L/min oxygen supply. Laboratory tests showed increased CRP plasma levels (79.2 mg/L， reference range0.00-5.00 mg/L)， but no leukocytosis； instead， there was lym-phopenia of 14.9% (reference range 17-47%). Imaging， in-cluding chest X-ray and thoracic computed tomography (CT)，revealed typical streaky infiltrates on both sides . D-dimers were slightly elevated (0.93 pg/mL， reference range0.00-0.50 pg/mL). Pulmonary embolism， however， was defin-itively excluded by CT angiography.\n\n【11】Three sequential blood cultures taken over the following days revealed 1 positive culture only (Micrococcus luteus， con-sidered as contamination). PCR analysis of a throat smear for SARS-CoV-2 was initiated. High-flow oxygen therapy(HFOT)/80%0， and non-invasive ventilation (NIV)/70%0achieved a PaO， of 60% only. The patient was rapidly trans-ferred to the ICU and intubated. PCR results revealed SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Mutation analysis of combined deletion H69-V70 and mutation N501Y revealed the VOC B. 1.1.7 vari-ant. Empiric antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam was started immediately after transfer to the ICU on day 0 to avoid bacterial superinfection.\n\n【12】A sharp increase in CRP plasma levels over the next day and continuous respiratory worsening led us to start CRP aphere-sis in addition to continuous standard therapy for SARS-CoV-2infection. The latter included lung-protective ventilation with low tidal volumes， best positive end-expiratory pressure (after PEEP-trial)， i.v. dexamethasone 6 mg/d， anti-coagulation with heparin， intermittent prone positioning of 16 to 20 h， and， fi-nally， antibiotic treatment to avoid potential bacterial super-infection. Written informed consent for CRP apheresis was obtained from the patient\\`s relatives after a detailed informa-tive discussion. Discussion with the Ethics Committee of Ulm University had been conducted previously .\n\n【13】CRP apheresis  was started via Shaldon catheter  to allow easy change from dorsal to ventral patient position 50 h after admission. His acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) category  changed from severe (PaO，/FIO， <100 mmHg) to moderate (PaO，/FIO，<200 mmHg) after intubation and ven-tral positioning， and then worsened during CRP apheresis due to dorsal positioning. After CRP apheresis， Horovitz quotient， independent from dorsal or ventral positioning， significantly improved until extubation and hospital discharge. In 1 apher-esis session only， ≥7500 mL plasma was treated. CRP plasma levels and other laboratory results during his hospital stay are depicted in Figures 2-4. CRP apheresis efficiently reduced CRP plasma levels  from a maximum of 161.63 mg/L to32.58 mg/L. Interestingly， CRP levels did not rise again after this first treatment， and instead declined to normal values. Other laboratory parameters， including creatinine and biliru-bine plasma levels， I-lactate-dehydrogenase (LDH)， and cre-atinine-kinase (CK)， only slightly increased or remained con-stant (CK-MB) . Sequential Organ Failure Assessment(SOFA) score - creatinine (reference range 0.7-1.2 mg/dL)， platelet count (reference range 146 000-328 000) and biliru-bine (reference range <1.2 mg/dl) - remained normal until extubation and ICU discharge. Respiratory parameters mark-edly and quickly improved . Extracorporeal mem-brane oxygenation was not necessary. The patient was extu-bated on day 5 after admission and was discharged from the ICU on day 6. A second low CRP peak (22.41 mg/L) on day 7， as reported by others (Esposito F， personal communications)， remained clinically inapparent. Control imaging in this young man， if clinically necessary， was recommended in the outpa-tient setting. He was discharged from our hospital in good clin-ical condition on day 8 after admission.\n\n【14】Although CRP has been known since 1930 ， its role in the human immune system remains enigmatic. Increasing evi-dence， however， suggests that CRP is probably the first anti-body-like molecule in the evolution of the immune system in general and may be an atavism in the immune system of hu-mans in particular . Assuming that CRP， in COVID-19 disease， can trigger a fulminant autoimmune reaction by CRP-mediated complement and macrophage activation ， we have now treated a\"lower-risk\" COVID-19 patient with respiratory failure and sharply rising CRP plasma levels by selective and efficient CRP apheresis  through central venous access .\n\n【15】Of course， our patient received optimized standard therapy ac-cording to the latest medical recommendations. When we ob-served clinical worsening， we discussed selective CRP apheresis as a bail-out therapy and achieved consensus with his fami-ly. Due to successful treatment of cases reported in the me-dia， and due to our long-standing experience with selective CRP apheresis in clinical trials and due to the lack of alterna-tive therapies ， we finally made the decision to treat our young patient with this novel technology.\n\n【16】SARS-CoV-2 is still a viral infection with high lethality . A poorly understood autoimmune response with early and ag-gressive lung injury and consecutive ARDS seems to be inti-mately involved in this high lethality. In patients with a poor outcome， CRP levels are usually strongly elevated and are as-sociated with poor prognosis. In contrast， procalcitonin levels are usually not elevated (as was the case in our patient) or are rather moderately elevated， indicating that bacterial or fungal superinfection is not present in the early stages of the disease.\n\n【17】These clinical observations lead to the intriguing question of whether the virus itself or an inadequate， uncontrolled im-mune response of the ancient immune system (CRP， comple ment， macrophages) triggered by alveolar hypoxia is the real cause of the fatal clinical course in some patients . Lowering CRP plasma levels may thus be the key step to avoid immunological self-destruction of the lungs and multi-organ failure. Selective CRP apheresis may be the method of choice to reach this target. In fact， this case report on CRP aphere-sis in a “lower-risk\" COVID-19 patient with respiratory failure further supports our hypothesis for 2 reasons：  CRP apher-esis in the phase of sharp CRP rise was able to effectively and permanently reduce CRP plasma levels in this patient， and  CRP reduction was accompanied by marked clinical improve-ment， early extubation， and relatively short hospital stay of our patient.\n\n【18】COVID-19 mortality is known to depend on comorbidi-ties . In comparison to our first-in-man case report on CRP apheresis in COVID-19 disease ， we have now treat-ed a younger patient with fewer comorbidities. Although the current patient was infected with the B. 1.1.7 variant (consid-ered as being more infectious and potentially more lethal)， he definitely suffered from fewer comorbidities than our first patient . Also， he was much younger (39 vs 72 years\\]. For these reasons， we have clinically rated him as a “lower-risk”COVID-19 patient. The latter may be important for the design of randomized clinicaltrials， as inclusion of “high-risk”patients could negatively influence the results. Certainly， his younger age and accompanying improved standard therapy may have caused a better outcome. However， the ultimate reason for this favorable outcome may have been the use of early CRP apheresis in combination with fewer comorbidities and im-proved standard therapy. Perhaps， this early CRP apheresis in the phase of sharp CRP rise suppressed the excessive auto-immune response of the ancient immune system， which may be the real cause of the respiratory failure， multi-organ fail-ure， and death in COVID-19 patients.\n\n【19】In conclusion， this case report underlines the urgent need for a randomized， controlled， multicenter trial comparing CRP apheresis treatment plus standard treatment to standard treatment alone. The latter has been initiated and can mark-edly improve outcomes in COVID-19 patients with respirato ry failure and provide deep and fascinating insights into the role of ancient immunity in humans .\n\n【20】Conclusions\n\n【21】SARS-CoV-2 can cause multi-organ failure by triggering an un-controlled CRP-mediated autoimmune response of ancient im-munity. CRP apheresis in the early phase of CRP increase and respiratory worsening may be an effective treatment for pa-tients severely threatened by SARS-CoV-2 infection", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Motorbike riders have the highest incidence of road traffic accidents. The maxillofacial region is highly vulnerable to such incidents. Injuries to this region can lead to severe bleeding and airway compromise. Not wearing a helmet and drug intoxication can increase the risk of accidents and their complications. Patterns and severity of these injuries vary with road conditions， speed and type of impact. Aims and Objectives： The current study intends to assess the patterns and severity of maxillofacial injuries among intoxicated and non-intoxicated victims of motorbike accidents. Materials and Methods： The present study was a single-centre， Prospective Observational study conducted on patients admitted into the emergency medicine department with suspected maxillofacial injuries to motorbike accidents at PESIMSR Hospital， Kuppam， from October2018 to July 2020. Results： There was a clear male preponderance with 11 males for every female. Two-thirds of patients were aged between 25 and 50 years. Skid and fall and head-on-collision were common mechanisms of injury. Soft-tissue injuries like abrasions and lacerations were common injuries.Ninety-one patients had facial fractures， mostly involving the midface. Nasal bone fractures were most frequent. Of the 149 patients， 54 had an A.I.S. score of 1， 43 had 2，21 had 3，18 had 4 and 13 had 5. There was no significant difference in the severity or patterns of injuries in intoxicated patients. Conclusion： Midface injuries are more common. Intoxication increases the risk of injuries. But it does not seem to alter the patterns and severity of injuries.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS maxillofacial injuries， patterns and severity， motorbike accidents， the influence of alcohol\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Trauma is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality world-wide. Two-wheeler riders have the highest road traffic accidents due to their unrestrained nature. Risk is compounded by alco-capacity. Also， alcohol leads to risk-taking behaviour， impaired judgment and involvement in dangerous and adventurous activ-ities. This type of behaviour leads to an increased rate of severity and mortality. Chest， head， neck， maxillofacial and abdominal injuries are common in two-wheeler accidents-.\n\n【4】Maxillofacial trauma can be trivial and cause only cosmetic disfigurement. However， it can also lead to death due to airway compromise. Maxillofacial injuries will not occur alone and may be associated with head， neck and long bones injuries. Maxillofa-cial injuries happen in many trauma patients requiring prompt diagnosis and management. Maxillofacial trauma is a joint pre-sentation in Accident and Emergency departments of hospitals either as an isolated injury or as part of multiple injuries to thehead， neck， chest， and abdomen. These injuries may cause se-vere physical， physical， and cosmetic disabilities. The aetiology of maxillofacial trauma varies from one geographical region to another. Depending on the prevailing socio-economic， cultural， and environmental factors， it can also differ within the same area. The injury severity may vary from superficial soft tissue lacerations to more complicated fractures of the maxillofacial skeleton².\n\n【5】Aims and Objectives\n\n【6】The current study intends to assess the patterns and severity of maxillofacial injuries among intoxicated and non-intoxicated victims of motorbike accidents.\n\n【7】Materials and Methods\n\n【8】The present study was a single-centre， Prospective Observa-tional study conducted on patients admitted into the emergency medicine department with suspected maxillofacial injuries to motorbike accidents at PESIMSR Hospital， Kuppam， from Octo-ber 2018 to July 2020.\n\n【9】Inclusion criteria\n\n【10】·All patients suspected to have facial trauma after a motor-bike accident\n\n【11】Exclusion criteria\n\n【12】·Extremes of Age\n\n【13】· Patients not willing the study\n\n【14】Study design\n\n【15】· TOOLS TO BE USED\n\n【16】Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS)\n\n【17】AIS Code Description\n\n【18】1 Minor\n\n【19】2 Moderate\n\n【20】3 Serious (non-life-threatening)\n\n【21】Severe(life-threatening)\n\n【22】5 Critical\n\n【23】6 Unsalvageable\n\n【24】·X-ray maxilla\n\n【25】· CT facial bones\n\n【26】Method of Collection of Data\n\n【27】· All cases presented to the emergency medicine department with motorbike accidents will be evaluated per standard protocols. According to the A.I.S. score， patients with facial injuries will be scored for severity.\n\n【28】· Details regarding alcohol consumption will be collected for analysis.\n\n【29】Statistical analysis\n\n【30】Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistic for Windows. Data will be presented as descriptive， and a t-test will be used to check statistical significance.\n\n【31】One hundred forty-nine patients satisfying the inclusion crite-ria were enrolled for the study. There were 137 males and 12females.\n\n【32】People aged between 25 and 50 accounted for 76.50%， fol-lowed by those aged less than 25 (16.8%). Skid and fall were the most common mechanism of injury， followed by a head-on collision with another object or vehicle. In addition， 83 (55.7%) had consumed alcohol before the incident， and 66 (44.3%) did not. 135(90%) patients did not wear a helmet at the incident. The most common facial injuries were abrasions and lacerations.\n\n【33】91(67.4%) patients had facial fractures. Fractures of the mid-face were most frequent ， followed by multiple facial bone fractures ， upper face ， and lower face ， in that order.\n\n【34】At the time of admission to the hospital， 120(80.6%) patients had a patent airway， 16 (10.7%) patients had maintainable air-way， and 13 (8.7%) patients had a compromised airway needing intubation and mechanical ventilation. The most common rea-son for intubation was airway compromise due to reduced G.C.S. and bleeding from the facial injury. Head injury  and long bone fractures  were the most common associated injuries. A minority of patients had chest and abdominal trauma.\n\n【35】Discussion\n\n【36】A road traffic accident is a significant public health problem. It results in death and disability among the survivors， who can be a burden to society. India， being a developing country is under-going a demographic， epidemiological， and economic transition that has changed the health scenario significantly.\n\n【37】The effectiveness of various preventive and educational pro-grams concerning maxillofacial trauma may be reflected through a continuing audit of the pattern of such trauma in different parts of the world. Considerable variation has been reported in the profile of facial injuries concerning geographical location， socio-economic status， and cultural background.\n\n【38】The observations and results of the present study were com-pared with the available previous similar studies. There was a clear male preponderance in the present study with a male to female ratio of 11.41： 1. In the study done by Karpal S Sohal， there was a vast male preponderance with a male： female ratio of 37.7：1. Other studies by Abul Hasnat  and Satish Kumar G. Patil  showed a similar male preponderance with a male to female ratio of 7.5： 1 and 10.1： 1， respectively. The seeming differences can be attributed to the males and females ratio in the particular community and socio-cultural habits. In most rural societies， females are confined to the home and undertake travels less frequently. Even if females travel on motorcycles， they will be pillion-riders rather than riders.\n\n【39】.the study by Abul Hasnat et a1.4； found that most patients were in the age group 20 to 40 years. The mean age was 29.63years， which is similar to other studies. The possible explanation is that the people in this age group participate in dangerous sports and drive motor vehicles carelessly. Patients less than tenyears and more than 60 years were less frequently affected in the current study. This could explain that elders usually take care of children while travelling and less mobility of seniors.\n\n【40】Similar observations were made by Mishra B et al. Bener A.7Jirojwong S，8 WHO in the Injury Chart book°， Rakhi Dandona et al.，10 Khare N et a1.，11 Agarwal et a1.，12. Similar findings were also observed in Delhi，13 and Pondicherry studies.14 This can be attributed to the fact that this age group is more active and often travels for the job and recreational activities. They also tend to use less protective gear and involve in dangerous adventures. In addition， more young people have less access to two-wheelers.\n\n【41】In the present study， about 42.3% of collisions are self-skid. Fall， followed by 39.6% head-on collisions，rear-end collisions were 8.1%， and hit by four-wheeler was observed in 4.7%， and trauma of unknown mechanism in 4% of the cases. On the other hand， the study BY Khare et a1.11 shows that 41.9% of R.T.A.s were due to skid & fall，15.2%head-on collisions and 6%sideway collisions. On the other hand， Suhas babu15 et al. found that a sideways collision of 46.7% is the prime mechanism， followed by a head-on collision of 27.5%.\n\n【42】Victims were hit from behind16.9 % of the time， and 8.9%gave a history of self-fall.\n\n【43】These studies' differences can be explained based on the roads' socio-economic conditions， type， and status. When the road surface is improper， the chances of self falls increase. The same can occur when obtuse turnings with poor visibility are present. Alcoholics or intoxicated riders can lose balance very quickly. This explains the higher rates of self falls in the current study. Side-on collisions usually occur when vehicles travel at higher speeds， especially near highway junctions.\n\n【44】Head-on-collisions occur on narrower roads without road di-viders where traffic is bidirectional.Rural roads are usually nar-rower， and bidirectional traffic explains the disproportionately higher percentage of head-on-collisions in the current study.\n\n【45】Among 149 patients， 83 (55.7%) were under alcohol， and66 (44.3%) had not consumed alcohol. The ratio between the alcoholic and non-alcoholic is 1.25：1. The current study has a higher proportion of accident victims who have consumed alcohol before riding. The survey conducted by Bharadwaj et al. shows that 18.01% of victims had a history of alcohol consumption within 6 hours before the accident. In the WHO-supported study in Nepall6 (16.9%) of victims consumed alcohol2 to 3 hours before the accident. Sreedharan J 17 had found that 20 % of the motorcycle riders had consumed alcohol. The availability of alcohol stores in highway junctions may be why a higher percentage of alcoholic riders in this study.\n\n【46】In the present study， 33.6% of patients had a loss of conscious-ness (L.O.C.)， and 66.4% didn't have L.O.C. The ratio between Consciousness and L.O.C. is 1：1.98. Most patients presented with a history of L.O.C. Impaired consciousness due to alcohol intoxication and head injury following the accident. The study conducted by Pati ss18 et al. showed that L.O.C. was 38%. The survey conducted by Deepak Sharma et a1.1 showed that L.O.C. was 35%. Loss of consciousness in trauma patients is reported to increase the risk of serious complications.\n\n【47】Patients with a history of L.O.C. traumatic brain injury should be ruled out first. The Glasgow Coma Scale (G.C.S.) was created to assess a coma's depth from traumatic unconsciousness causes.\n\n【48】In our study， 59.7% of patients had a G.C.S between 13-and15， 28.2% of patients between 8-and 13， and 12.1% of patients had a G.C.S below 8. A similar observation was found in other studies like Godavarthi et a1.20. B Agrawal et a1.21.G.C.S. scoreis a good indicator of outcome in many other studies， including alocal survey by Selladurai BM et a1.22. which showed that over95% of patients with a score of 4 or less are likely to have a poor outcome compared with those with a score of 8 or a more.\n\n【49】In the present study， among 149 patients，10.1% of patients had lacerations. Other studies like Singh SP et al.， Shakeer Kahn P et al. and Niazi et al. observed a high cuts rate.\n\n【50】In this study， among 149 patients， 40.3% of patients had abra-sions. Similar percentages were observed by Shakeer Kahn P et al. and Niazi et a1. In this study， facial contusions and abrasions were the most frequent types of soft tissue injuries， followed by lacerations. Previous studies on maxillofacial injuries have reported contusions and abrasions as regular occurrences. In contrast，lacerations have been reported more frequently in se-vere trauma episodes resulting from traffic accidents.\n\n【51】. Fractures of the midface were most frequent ， followed by multiple facial bone fractures ，upper face ， and lower face ， in that order. Kapoor P et al. 2 study found that soft tissue trauma was the most common type of maxillofacial in-jury. Among patients with maxillofacial skeletal fractures， the mandible was the most frequently fractured bone (63.0%)，fol-lowed by the midface (22.0%)， while the remaining 15.0% cases demonstrated pan-facial fractures. Kai lee et al. study found that nasal bone (29.14%) was most often the fracture site， followed by the mandible (28.0%). Sharma M et al. study. Nasal frac-tures were found in 39.32%， followed by Zygomatic fractures in23.59% and Maxillary fractures in 20%.\n\n【52】Mandibular fractures were the least common (16.85).\n\n【53】Most studies have found that nasal bones were most com-monly fractured， followed by the maxilla and mandible. Nasal bones， most prominent on the face， will be easily cracked even with a trivial force like a direct blow or falling face down. As far as other bones are concerned， considerable power is required to cause a fracture.\n\n【54】At the time of admission to the hospital， 80.6% of patients had a patent airway， 10.7% of patients' airways were maintainable， and 8.7% had a compromised airway. Saudi J Anaesth20.2011 et al. observed that in patients with maxillofacial injuries， airway secured by nasal intubation with direct visualization of vocal cords was most common in 57% of patients， followed by oral intubation in 17% of patientsMaxillofacial trauma has its importance as it involves both vital and nonvital organs. It looks ghastly， may lead to massive haemorrhage， and is potentially life-threatening. The priority in these patients is airway maintenance with cervical spine control and management based on the Advanced Trauma Life Support(ATLS) concept for patients who sustained life-threatening in-iuries.\n\n【55】In this study， the riders under alcohol influence were more than non-intoxicated riders. The riders with more severe injuries were those under alcohol intoxication. Hence it is clearly under-stood that patients under the influence of alcohol were high-risk drivers. Furthermore， most R.T.A s happen under the influence of alcohol， and the severity of injuries as per A.I.S score was also higher in patients under alcohol. However， comparative data is lacking either to support or reject the findings.\n\n【56】Conclusion\n\n【57】Half of the road traffic accidents happen when the riders are under alcohol intoxication. Alcohol and driving should never be mixed. Alcohol increases the frequency of road traffic accidents. Alcohol does not seem to alter the pattern or severity.\n\n| Fractured region  | No. of patients  | Percentage  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| No fractures  | 58  | 38.9  |\n| Lower face  | 8  | 5.4  |\n| Midface  | 59  | 39.8  |\n| Upper face  | 11  | 7.4  |\n| Multiple facial fractures  | 13  | 8.7  |\n\n【59】Table 2 ALCOHOL and its association with AIS SCORE among the subjects.\n\n| AIS SCORE  | ALCOHOL  |  | x2 value  | 'p'value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| AIS SCORE  | Yes  | No  | x2 value  | 'p'value  |\n| 1  | 28(51.85%)  | 26(48.15%)  | 6.3334  | 0.176  |\n| 2  | 20 (46.51%)  | 23(53.48%)  | 6.3334  | 0.176  |\n| 3  | 12(57.47%)  | 9 (42.85%)  | 6.3334  | 0.176  |\n| 4  | 14(77.77%)  | 4(33.34%)  | 6.3334  | 0.176  |\n| 5  | 9(69.23%)  | 4(30.76%)  | 6.3334  | 0.176  |\n| Total  | 66  | 83  |  |  |\n\n【61】Injuries to the midface region， especially those of nasal bones， are more frequent， which may cause airway compromise.

Acute lobar collapse due to reflex bronchoconstriction is a rare entity， and although its development during induction of anesthesia has been reported previously， there are no reports on its accurrence during emergence from anesthesia . In this report we present a morbidly obese patient with right upper lobe(RUL) atelectasis， which developed immediately after tra-cheal extubation in an emergency laparotomy procedure.\n\n【9】CASE REPORT\n\n【10】A 56-year-old woman with BMI=41 (160 cm height and105 kg weight) was diagnosed with gastric ulcer perforation and was scheduled for emergency surgery. There were no pathologic findings on physical examination except for ten-derness with guarding and rebound at the upper abdomen. She had no history of asthma or drug allergies. Routine lab-oratory investigations were performed. Leukocyte count was16.000 1/mL.Other investigations including blood count， coagulation and biochemical tests were within normal lim-its. ECG was normal， and chest radiograph demonstrated free gas under both hemidiaphragms.\n\n【11】Anesthesia was induced with 500 mg thiopental， 100 pg fen-tanyl， and 60 mg rocuronium. Intubation was performed with a 7.5 mm cuffed endotracheal tube， secured between the lips at 20 cm. Equal breathing sounds were auscultated in both lung fields. Anesthesia was maintained using sevo-flurane with end-tidal of 1.5-2% in a N，O/oxygen mixture and inspired oxygen fraction at 0.4. The operation and an-esthesia were uneventful. At the end of the surgical pro-cedure， inhalation anesthetics were stopped and the pa-tient was ventilated manually with 100% O，for 3 minutes. Neuromuscular recovery was facilitated with intravenous in-jection of 2.5 mg neostigmine and 1.25 mg atropine. The patient was extubated with endotracheal suctioning when her spontaneous breathing was sufficient.\n\n【12】A few minutes after extubation， the SaO， decreased from100% to 82% and the right side of the chest ceased to rise with inspiration. Breath sounds on auscultation were di-minished on the right side of the chest， and wheezing was heard. Because of the sudden decrease in SaO， and blur-ring of consciousness， she was re-intubated and ventilated100%O. Arterial blood gas analysis taken at this time re-vealed respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia (pH： 7.27， Pco。50 mm Hg， Po。 62 mm Hg， SaO。87%，HCO：21 mmol/L， base excess： -3.2 mmol/L).Bronchospasm was diagnosed and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit(ICU). Pressure-controlled ventilation with PEEP (8 cm H，O) was started. Aerosolized salbutamol was adminis-tered by inhalation， and 150 mg ofmethylprednisolone and100 mg of aminophylline were given intravenously， followed by intravenous aminophylline infusion at 0.2 mg/kg/min. Chest roentgenogram showed right upper lobe atelectasis. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy showed that the tra-cheobronchial tree had no mucous or foreign body ob-structions. Repeat chest X-ray taken 1 hour later revealed full re-expansion of the collapsed RUL ， and the patient was subsequently extubated. Her arterial blood gasvalues and breathing sounds returned to normal. The pa-tient was discharged from the ICU on the following day without any complications.\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n\n【14】Atelectasis is a major cause of impaired oxygenation in pa-tients under anesthesia， and may occur during induction or maintenance. One of the mechanisms of atelectasis is the obstruction of a bronchus by excessive mucus， aspiration， or bronchoconstriction. After complete airway occlusion， a pocket of gas is trapped in the lung unit distal to the obstruc-tion， and absorption of gas behind the occluded airway may result in a pulmonary collapse . Fiberoptic bronchosco-py in our patient did not show any mucous plugs， obstruc-tion or foreign bodies in the trachea or the right and left endobronchial system.\n\n【15】Stimulation of the airways may cause vagally-in duced bron-choconstriction with subsequent reflex atelectasis. This is characterized by a rapid onset， absence of intrabronchi-al obstruction， and signs of parasympathetic stimulation. There are only a few reports on collapse of the RUL after bronchospasm， and these have occurred during the induc-tion or maintenance of anesthesia . In our patient，however， atelectasis developed immediately after extubation. Reflex bronchospasm can be triggered by inadvertent ex-tubation and tracheal aspiration， or by the presence of ex-cessive secretion in the airways. Bronchospasm is more fre-quent during induction or maintenance compared to the emergence and recovery from anesthesia because of vari-ous factors such as induction agents . This may also ex-plain in part why reflex atelectasis develops more frequent-ly during this period.\n\n【16】Review of the literature shows that acute lobar collapse as-sociated with bronchospasm mostly involves the RUL in anesthetized patients . It has been postulated that the relatively straight right mainstem bronchus and an al-most 90°take-off in the RUL bronchus may create a favor-able condition for the Bernoulli effect around the opening of the RUL bronchus . As seen in this patient， increased airway resistance related to the bronchospasm might have caused rapid laminar flow in the trachea， and therefore di-rected the airflow toward the right lower and middle lobes， bypassing the RUL bronchus. Previous case reports also sug-gest this mechanism .\n\n【17】It has been shown that morbidly obese patients (MO) have a greater risk of atelectasis during general anesthesia than nonobese patients . This is related to more marked re-duction in respiratory system compliance and function-al residual capacity， and increased airway resistance . Eichenberger et al.  have demonstrated that the per-centage of pulmonary atelectasis was significantly higher in morbidly obese patients than in nonobese patients before anesthesia induction and after tracheal extubation. In addi-tion， atelectasis persisted in the postoperative period for at least 24 hours in MO patients. In our patient， morbid obe-sity might have contributed to development of acute RUL atelectasis by increasing airway resistance.\n\n【18】Benoit et al.  showed that the use of 100% oxygen at the end of general anesthesia facilitates postoperative atel-ectasis formation. Inspired oxygen fraction of 1.0 is associ-ated with an increased rate of gas absorption from the un-ventilated alveoli and decreased time to alveolar collapse. In our case， we believe that the presence of a high alveolar oxygen tension due to ventilation with 100% oxygen beforetracheal extubation might have facilitated bronchospasm-induced atelectasis.\n\n【19】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【20】In conclusion， morbidly obese patients may develop bron-chospasm-associated acute RUL atelectasis immediately af-ter tracheal extubation， and the use of 100% oxygen may facilitate atelectasis formation. Reflex atelectasis can be ef-fectively treated with mechanical ventilation and broncho-dilators. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy is necessary to identify the pathogenesis of bronchoconstriction. Anesthesiologists must be cautious about reflex atelectasis of the RULimme-diately after tracheal extubation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Otology serum and Prick tests revealed negative results. Moreover the patient was found to have no allergic reactions to any food， tree， grass， mold， and animals. The organisms were identified as C. cayetanensis and C. paruum in the stool sample. After mvr treated with Metronidazole and Azithromycin. Fecal specimen were examined. As a result no sign of the parasites were observed and urticaria complaints disappeared.\n\n【5】Conclusions：\n\n【6】This report is the first case that have seen co-infection of cyclosporiasis and cryptosporidiasis in an immunocompetent patient who have urticaria complaints and without diarrhea. It is believed that these parasites are likely to cause allergic reactions among patients who have constant urticaria complaints， can not develop immunological reaction to various allergens， and have high total IgE antibodies.\n\n【7】Key words：\n\n【8】Cyclospora cayetanensis·Cryptosporidium parvum· urticaria· mild stool occlusion\n\n【9】The genus Cyclospora and Cryptosporidium is in the subclass Coccidia， phylum Apicomplexa. The intestinal coccidians， Cyclospora cayetanensis and Cryptosporidium parvum are associated with gastroin-testinal disease in human . They are transmitted by oocysts from person-to-person by the fecal-oral route or via contaminated water or food. Cyclospora oocysts in freshly excreted stool are noninfectious. The oocysts are thought to require days to weeks outside the host under favorable environmental conditions to sporulate and thus to become infectious. Direct person-to-person transmission by fecal exposure is unlikely， because excreted oocysts must sporulate to become infective .\n\n【10】The most common symptom of infection is diar-rhea， however， asymptomatic infections also occur. Infections are associated with intestinal inflamma-tion， with pathological lesions such as villus blunt-ing， and abnormal function such as malabsorption. Mild-to-moderate， self-limiting diarrhea is common in healthy individuals ingesting infective stages of these organisms. However， patients with immune dysfunction can have severe intestinal injury and pro-longed diarrhea . The oocysts of C. cayetanensis are spherical in shape and between 7.5 and 10um in diameter， The oocysts of C. cayetanensis are up to twice the size of C. parvum oocysts. The modified acid fast-stain may be used to detect the oocysts， together with their overall morphologic features， permits dif-ferentiation of these organisms . Wet preparations and trichrome stains do not adequately detect the coccidian organisms， C cayetanensis and C parvumi. Identification of these organisms requires special staining techniques. The Modified acid-fast stain or Kinyoun’s acid-fast stain may be used to detect the oocysts of all of these coccidian organisms .\n\n【11】In 2007 a six-year-old boy living in Elbistan， a non-tropical region in Turkey， was transferred by his parents to the Dermatology policlinic in Turgut Ozal Medical Center of Inonu University from Elbistan state hospital due to prolonged pruritic swellings on his body. The patient showed no symptoms such as stomachache， fever， nausea and vomiting. His fecal sample was mild with no trace of mucosa or blood. The patient was reported to defecate once a day. Also it was reported by the patient's relatives that he only had pruritic swellings on his body and his complaints were released after having antihistaminic. It was reported that The patient didn't have any allergies such as drug and examined with urticaria etiology. His parents were forwarded to diet policlinic for information.\n\n【12】Laboratory methods\n\n【13】Stool sample was examined by conventional coprologi cal methods such as fresh preparation， iodine stain， flotation， modified Ritchie's method by Parasitology Laboratory at Turgut Ozal Medicine Faculty and Suspicious organisms (8-10 um in diameter) were seen in stool. And It was suspected that They would be C. cavetanensis oocysts. Stool was concentrated by the formalin-ethylacetate technique. Smears were prepared for examination of oocysts. Smears were also dried， fixed in methanole， and then they were stained with Modified acid-fast staining， contain 5% sulfuric acid， was employed for decolorization. The organisms were identified as C. cayetanensis  and C. par-vum . Laboratory studies on admission were notable， with PLT of 434 units/L， EO of 4.4 units/L， ASO of 148 units/L， CRP of 3 units/L， AST of 25units/L， ALT of 12 units/L， and Total IgE of 75 IU/mL. Otology serum and Prick test (This test is done by placing a drop of a solution containing a possibleallergen on the skin， and a series of scratches or needle pricks allows the solution to enter the skin. If the skin develops a red， raised itchy area， This is called a positive reaction) revealed negative results. Moreover the patient was found to have no allergic reaction to any food， tree， grass， mold， and animals. Patient was treated with Metronidazole two doses of250mg daily for 7 days and Azithromycin one dose of 200mg per day for 3 days. Fecal specimen were then collected on day 30 and reexamined. As a result no sign of the parasites were observed and urticaria complaints disappeared.\n\n【14】DISCUSSION\n\n【15】Although the first outbreak of well water-acquired cryptosporidiosis in the United states was seen in Texas in 1983. The most widely recognized outbreak occurred a decade later in 1993 in association with contamination of a municipal water source with cryptosporidium oocysts originating from cattle .\n\n【16】C. parvum and C. cayetanensis are considerated to\n\n【17】be the major organism contaminating drinking water supplies and their oocysts are resistant to current water treatment procedures， including chlorination. Most coccidian parasites acquired from water or food can cause gastroenteritis. C. cayetanensis can cause illness that varies significantly depend-ing on the age and condition of the host and the infectious dose that initiates disease is unknown. It infects the small intestine and commonly causes watery diarrhea， loss of appetite， weight loss， ab-dominal bloating and cramping， increased flatu-lence， nausea， fatigue， and low-grade fever. In some cases， patients experience vomiting， muscle aches， substantial loss of weight and diarrhea that can be explosive. The incubation period averages 1 week with illness lasting up to 6 weeks； asymptomatic in-fections， relapses and chronic post resolution sequels can occur. If untreated，illness may follow a remit-ting-relapsing course . Alternative treatments have not yet been identified. Limited data suggest that the following drugs are ineffective： albendazole， azithromycin， nalidixic asid， norfloxacin， tinidazole， metronidazole， quinacrine， tetracycline， and dilox-anide furoate . Known as the infection mainly specific to HIV infected patients and patients with suppressed immune system until 1982， C. parvum and C. cavetanensis infections have been detected thanks to improved laboratory-based diagnostic methods to cause epidemics among communities with(C. cayetanensis， and C. parvum) requires specialstaining techniques. The modified acid-fast stain may be used to detect the oocysts of all of these coccid-ian organisms . The exact pathogenesis by which parasites may precipitate urticaria is not known. Whether urticaria occurs on the basis of immunologic reaction to antigen produced by the organisms or the infestation alters intestinal permeability which may facilitate antigen entry is not clear . Several reports described the association between protozoans and helminths with allergic cutaneous diseases such as urticaria， pruritus， and dermatitis Nevertheless， it is not known whether parasites enhance the probability of getting allergies or being allergic predisposes one to parasitic infection. and there are occasional case reports which mention clearance of urticaria follow-ing treatment of parasites with appropriate therapy. Several different hypotheses have been suggested， but the mechanisms by which parasites could stimulate the clinical expression of allergic reactivity are not fully understood. It has been well established that infections by intestinal helminths are frequently as-sociated with immediate hypersensitivity reactions and eosinophilia and can also cause the polyclonal stimulation of immunoglobulin E (IgE) synthesis. In addition， a number of reports have described the existence of allergic symptoms in persons with pro-tozoan infections .\n\n【18】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【19】It should be noted that in cases in which the stool preparations are not carefully examined， oocysts might be misinterpreted due to the iodine staining of fecal compounds. It is thought that these parasites are likely to cause allergic reactions among patients who have constant urticaria complaints， can not de-velop immunological reaction to various allergens， and have high total IgE antibodies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

We aimed to identify the role of aquaporins in arachnoid cyst specimens.\n\n【1】Case Reports： We selected 3 cases from our own facility and examined arachnoid cyst wall specimens， which were sampledintraoperatively. Patients presented with variable symptoms， a 52-year-old man with a “heavy sensation” in the head and dysesthesia on the left hand， a 68-year-old man with unsteady gait， and finally a 26-year-old woman with a history of intermittent headaches for 10 years. Intraoperative specimens were obtained and ex-amined. Evaluation techniques were light microscopy， immunohistochemical staining for aquaporin， and elec-tron microscopy. Light microscopy showed that cells were arranged in epithelium-like structures forming sev-eral thick lamellae， with visible connective tissue among them. Under electron microscopic examination， cells with many or few cell organelles and with spindle-like nuclei were arranged in lamellar or flattened structures. Many vacuolizations were seen in between. Interdigitation of cells and many desmosomes were observed. All3 cases were positive for aquaporin 1.\n\n【2】Conclusions： Our study showed that water transportation through aquaporin 1 has a potential role in the formation and ex-pansion of arachnoid cysts.\n\n【3】Keywords： Aquaporin ·Arachnoid Cysts· Cerebrospinal Fluid· Immunohistochemistry\n\n【4】Arachnoid cysts， summarized and reported as serous cysts in the arachnoid by R. Bright in 1831 ， are common and have been identified more frequently due to the increasing and widespread use of computer-assisted tomography scans (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in recent years.\n\n【5】Although these cysts are usually benign and do not require aggressive treatment， some patients suffer from severe symp-toms caused by the mass effect of the cyst， requiring surgi-cal intervention.\n\n【6】Different causes of water retention mechanisms  have been described in the past， including congenital factors leading to water retention and physical factors resulting in the develop-ment of water retention.\n\n【7】We examined 3 cases of arachnoid cysts that occurred in dif-ferent locations of the brain among different age groups of the adult population. Surgical specimens were obtained and immunohistochemical staining was performed to determine whether aquaporin has any relationship with the formation of water-containing cavities.\n\n【8】Case Reports\n\n【9】This case study was conducted in accordance with the prin-ciples of the Helsinki Declaration. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Review Board of Sapporo Tokushukai Hospital(Ethics Number 2018-0112). Additionally， participants were ful-ly informed and provided signed written consent.\n\n【10】Three cases were diagnosed neuroradiologically as arachnoid cysts by the Department of Neurosurgery， and underwent sur-gery in our institute. Surgical specimens were obtained during the excision of the cavity wall， and were later confirmed histo-pathologically. All specimens were sent to be microscopically examined by the following methods； routine hematoxylin-eo-sin (H-E) staining， immunohistochemical staining for aquapo-rin 1， 2， 3， 4， 5， and 9， and electron microscopy examination.\n\n【11】Case 1： A 52-Year-Old Man\n\n【12】The patient presented to our hospital with chief concerns of a“heavy sensation\" in the head and dysesthesia for 2 months on the 2d， 3nd， and 4h fingers of the left hand. MRI  revealed a mass located in the frontal interhemispheric fissure extending to the left frontal convex. The patient was diagnosed with a similar fluid mass 5 years prior to his visit， but with a much smaller size. The large mass showed a marked space-oc-cupying effect， which led us to perform surgical intervention.\n\n【13】After the dural opening following the initial left frontal crani-otomy， the cavity was proved to be located mainly in the inter-hemispheric fissure . The wall was minimally vascu-larized， containing clear and watery fluid. The cavity seemed to be created within the intra-arachnoid layer . The wall was thick around the cortical bridging veins. The cavity wall was mostly resected  and a part of it was sent to histopathology for immunohistochemical staining of aqua-porins. His postoperative course was uneventful， and his pre-operative neurological symptoms resolved significantly. The cavity shrank in size and nearly disappeared by the 20lh post-operative day. The cavity was practically invisible 30 months later .\n\n【14】Case 2： A 68-Year-Old Man\n\n【15】The patient suddenly presented with nausea and vertigo， lat-er vomited， and was transferred to our hospital.MRI revealed the existence of a cerebellar hemorrhage . A high-intensity mass-like lesion was also observed mainly in the left cerebellopontine angle extending to the dorsal side of the cerebellum.Conservative treatment was effective in relieving neurological symptoms. He quickly regained ambulatory func-tion with a slight degree of cerebellar sign， which presented prominently on the right side. The persistence of cerebellar signs led us to perform a partial excision of the cavity wall 13 months after the initial event. The suboccipital dura mater was opened， then a thin， fairly vascularized cavi-ty wall was observed . The wall on the side of the cerebellar tentorium was partially thickened . The dorsal side of the cavity wall and the one around the upper pons near the petrosal vein on the surface of the tentorium were excised  for staining. In the postoperatively phase， the cavity showed little change in size but the patient was relieved of his ataxic symptoms .\n\n【16】Case 3： A 26-Year-Old Woman\n\n【17】The patient had been experiencing intermittent headaches for10 years， which progressed to a consistent headache that led her to visit our hospital. No other neurological deficits were noted. MRI revealed a large mass lesion on the right tempo-ral pole . The signal intensity of the mass was simi-lar to water . Partial removal of the cavity wall was performed. The cavity wall was scarce in vasculature and the fluid consistency was watery . The cavity was created within the arachnoid layer . Her postoper-ative course was uneventful. Excision resulted in reduction of the mass size  and complete relief of the continu-ous headache.\n\n【18】Obtained specimens were embedded with paraffin and sent for routine H-E staining and immunohistochemical staining.\nthe specimens. Cells with small nuclei showing no atypicality are arranged like an epithelium forming several thicker lamellae (A). Vessels are rarely observed. In the thick part of the cavity wall， a round space is seen (B)， resembling epithelialized vacuoles. Connective tissue is seen in between (C) but not as rich. Original magnification is ×10.\n\n【19】Parts of the specimens were also fixed with glutaraldehyde for electron microscopic examination.\n\n【20】Antibodies used were highly specific rabbit antibodies to aqua-porins 1， 2， 3， 4，5， and 9 (Alpha Diagnostic International， Inc.， San Antonio， Texas， USA).\n\n【21】Light microscopic findings were essentially similar in all 3 cas-es. Cells with small nuclei showed no atypicality and were ar-ranged like epithelia， forming several or thickened lamellae. In the thick part of the cavity wall， vacuole-like spaces were observed . Connective tissue was seen in between . Vascularity was rarely present.\n\n【22】Out of the 3 cases we examined， all specimens stained global-ly positive for aquaporin 1 . However， aquaporins 2，3， 4， and 9 stained negative in all 3 cases. Nuclei in all 3 cas-es stained positive for aquaporin 5 .\n\n【23】For comparison， kidney specimens were used， with the fol-lowing findings. The glomeruli and proximal tubules widely stained positive for aquaporin 1 . Only the brush border was positive for aquaporin 2 . Only proximal tubules were positive for aquaporin 3 . The loops of Henle were partly positive for aquaporin 4. Nuclei of the prox-imal tubules were positive for aquaporin 5 ， and no areas stained positive for aquaporin 9. Results of the aquapo-rin staining are summarized in Table 1.\n\n【24】Electron microscopy showed that cells with many or few cell organelles and with spindle-like nuclei were arranged in la-mellar or flattened structures . Many vacuolizations(oval colored in yellow) were seen in between. Interdigitation of cells and many desmosomes (oval colored in red) were ob-served .\n\n【25】Discussion\n\n【26】Classically， arachnoid cysts were detected after patients pre-sented with symptoms caused by their mass effect， but recent rise in detection due to the development of radiographic mo-dalities such as CT and MRI have led to arachnoid cysts being found in subclinical stages. Even with the growing incidence of arachnoid cysts， its pathogenesis still seems to be ambiguous.\n\n【27】Table 1. Results of aquaporin staining.\n\n| Aquaporin  | Case 1  | Case 2  | Case 3  | Control (kidney)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| AQP1  | 十  | 十  | 十  | \\*1 in glomeruli， proximal tubules  |\n| AQP2  | 二  | 一  | 一  | \\*1 only in brush border  |\n| AQP3  |  |  |  | \\*1 only in proximal tubules  |\n| AQP4  |  |  | 一  | \\+ only in loops of Henle  |\n| AQP5  | \\+ in nuclei  | \\*1 in nuclei  | \\+ in nuclei  | \\+ in nuclei  |\n| AQP9  |  |  |  | —  |\n\n【29】Some postulated that the size of arachnoid cysts seemed to be stable in adult patients ， and expanding arachnoid cysts were seen mainly in the pediatric population .\n\n【30】Microscopic findings with H-E staining suggested water accu-mulation within the arachnoid layer， initiated by the splitting， tearing， or necrosis of the arachnoid layer. This phenomenon has been widely accepted since Rengachary and Watanabe an-alyzed over 200 cases of arachnoid cyst . The initial dam-aged area may heal through the generation of collagen， and consequential trapping of water via a check valve mecha-nism may occur.\n\n【31】The ultrastructure of the cyst wall was similar to that of the normal arachnoid. The wall cells showed an arachnoidal for-mation with regions of heterogenous thickness， with varying amounts of cell organelles due to mechanical stretching and compression. A great number of small vacuolizations were also observed. These small vacuoles， with thin and fragile walls， may gradually fuse with one another to become a larger wa-ter-containing cavity via scarring， finally resulting in a large water-containing cavity.\n\n【32】The existence of vasogenic edema as a cause of intercellular water retention was dismissed due to the presence of firmdesmosomes on the cavity wall. Firm adhesions between cells may well be the mechanism behind“non-communicat-ing\"cysts， which are completely isolated from the physiolog-ical cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulatory system.\n\n【33】Considering the mechanism of expansion of arachnoid cysts， several valve-like mechanisms have been proposed . Since the arachnoid wall is thin and fragile enough， the impact force might cause the tearing or splitting on the arachnoid structure itself. Then， normal pulsatile movements of the CSF help to cre-ate a one-way valve， commonly known as a check valve， result-ing in water accumulation， creating a solitary cavity. Moreover， the thin and fragile membrane of the arachnoid cyst is prone to spontaneous rupture， which may result in the size reduction.\n\n【34】Comparisons between congenital and acquired arachnoid cysts have also been a focus， where the osmotic gradient between cystic content and CSF seems to aid in its development . However， this theory is not widely supported， since the fluid contents such as electrolytes， sugar， and urea nitrogen do not differ between the cavity fluid and the normal CSF.\n\n【35】Although the evaluation of microscopic structures may suggest the mechanism of the initial formation of the cavity wall， this alone does not sufficiently explain the widely varying clinical course of arachnoid cysts. While some patients were asymp-tomatic for a long time， other patients presented with neu-rological deficits that required surgical intervention. Go et al suggested the possibility of the secretory ability of the cyst cell ； they postulated that ATPase and alkaline phospha-tase were partly responsible for the cyst cells. Rabiei et al alsoreported that there is a possibility of secretion because the cyst cells have rich microvilli on the luminal side of the wall in some cases . However， our previously-mentioned microscop-ic examinations revealed that the cavity wall was composed of thin meningothelial cells with small nuclei， and contained a fair amount of connective tissue. It also stained positive for vimentin， but stained negative for EMA， CEA， D，-40， and MIB-1.\n\n【36】Our findings suggest that the tissues are not of epithelial or lymphatic origin， as secretion hardly occurs toward the cavity lumen. Poor vascularity in the cavity wall also indicated that secretion from the cavity wall was less active， which adds valu-able evidence to our hypothesis that physiological secretion is unlikely to be a cause of simple water retention in arach-noid cysts. Additionally， fluid secretion is commonly associat-ed with protein exudation to a certain degree， which is not consistent with our MRI findings.\n\n【37】Aquaporin ， a passive， gradient-based water-transporting membrane protein， is known to have a major role in carrying wa-ter across the cell membrane . Varieties of aquaporin have been reported in the central nervous system； aquaporin 1 has been typically observed in the choroid plexus， whereas aquapo-rin 4 and 9 are found in astrocytes， associated with its water in-flux. On the other hand， aquaporin 2 is seen in the brush border of the kidney， aquaporin 3 occurs in epithelial cells， and aqua-porin 5 is found in the excretory epithelia and cell nuclei .\n\n【38】Basaldella et al stated there was no evidence that aquaporin1 was expressed in the normal arachnoid layer， arachnoid vil-li， and arachnoid cyst (cavity) wall ， but our studies suggestthe presence of aquaporin 1 in cavity wall cells. Specimens from all 3 cases stained positive for aquaporin 1， suggesting that fluid retention is related to the mechanism of CSF pro-duction ， despite the poor vascularity of the cyst wall. The area that stained positive for aquaporin 1 was not equally dis-tributed on the cavity wall. We suspect that regions with via-ble cell membranes stained positive for aquaporin 1， whereas the regions with weak or negative stains were dominated by scar tissue and/or connective tissue. This partial aquaporin 1expression may explain the variable clinical presentations， to-gether with the microscopic characteristics of the cavity wall. The existence of aquaporin expression may also explain the nature of the cavity content， which is watery fluid. Methods to quantify the function of aquaporin 1 in the arachnoid cyst wall are needed for a more precise evaluation.\n\n【39】In all of our cases， the cavity content was macroscopically col-orless and transparent， resembling CSF， and the radiographic appearance was similar to the CSF. The cavity showed no signs of microscopic communication with the physiological CSF cir-culatory system. The fact that the cavity membranes stained positive for aquaporin 1， which indicates that water retention occurs even with scarce vascularity and lack of secretory struc-tures in the cavity walls. We then hypothesized that arachnoid cysts are a secondary lesion following the fusion of numerousmicrovacuoles. Once they have fused and enlarged， water con-tinues to accumulate via transportation with aquaporin over the cavity wall .\n\n【40】This hypothesis does not conflict with the change in size of the cavity. As time progresses， the gradual increase in size ceases， and the cavity can rupture into the subarachnoid space and then into the CSF circulation.\n\n【41】This study， with its interesting and persuasive findings， is lim-ited by its small sample size， but has a potential role in iden-tifying the function of aquaporin. To provide sufficient statis-tical evidence of involvement in its continuous enlargement， studies with larger numbers of surgical specimens from arach-noid cysts are needed for aquaporin staining.\n\n【42】Conclusions\n\n【43】Our study showed that water transportation through aquaporin1 may be able to form and expand arachnoid cysts. While our hy-pothesis may contradict some studies， we believe it reinforces a number of supporting hypotheses for water retention of arach-noid cysts. The combined role of passive water flow and microte-ars may explain the gradual increase and decrease in cyst size.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Particularly in those with Normal Tension Glaucoma (NTG)， an autoimmune or vascular mechanism may be responsible for optic nerve head damage. Case Report： A 67-year-old woman presented for a routine eye exam at our office visit. About her past medical history， she only mentioned Raynaud’s Disease. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 on both eyes， and slit-lamp examination was normal. Intraocular pressure was 10 mmHg in both eyes and fundoscopy revealed cup to disc ratio 0.8 bilaterally. On physical examination， we found microstomy and puffy hands with pitting scars. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) demonstrated an inferotemporal decrease of the peripapillary Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RFNLpp) on the RE and in the inferotemporal and superotemporal sectors of the LE. OCT-Angiography was also performed to complement the study. Computerized Static Perimetry (CSP) revealed pericentral scotomas on both eyes. Water Drinking Test (WDT) and Diurnal IOP curve were performed with a significant fluctuation. A 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring demonstrated nocturnal hypotension. After a clinical process review， we found the diagnostic of PSS. The patient initiated hypotensive drugs and was oriented for adjustment of therapy. Conclusion： If we do not look beyond the eye to observe patient phenotype and past medical history we can miss important clues for the correct diagnosis and treatment， often with complementary multidisciplinary approaches.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Normal Tension Glaucoma， Progressive Systemic Sclerosis， Vascular Glaucoma Theory Systemic findings， Multidisciplinary approaches\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Glaucoma is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells and optic nerve ax-ons， and gradual loss of visual field. Although increased intraocular pressure (IOP) is the most critical risk factor for Glau-coma diagnosis and progression， glaucomatous optic nerve dam-age can develop at any level of IOP. Normal-Tension Glaucoma(NTG) is a diagnosis of exclusion， that can be extremely challeng-ing， due to its association with other independent pathogenic factors. Besides IOP， vasospasm， inadequate perfusion of theoptic nerve or an autoimmune component， may also have a role in Glaucoma pathology. Progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) is a connective tissue disease characterized by fibrosis of the skin and internal organs， with alterations in the microvasculature and various cellular and humoral immunity abnormalities. Many authors have reported an association between NTG and immune-related diseases， attributed to the coexistence of two dif-ferent diseases with a common vascular immunocompromised condition .\n\n【4】A case of NTG associated with PSS is presented，highlighting the importance of multidisciplinary approaches in NTG patients.\n\n【5】Case report\n\n【6】A 67-year-old woman presented for a routine check-up eye exam at our office visit. Her past medical history was positive to Raynaud's Disease concerning arthralgias and hand nodules. She was on medication with pentoxifylline 2id， nifedipine 1id， methotrexate 7.5 mg/week， Folic Acid 5 mg id and a natural product Evening Primrose Oil id. Best-corrected visual acuitywas 20/20， and slit-lamp examination was normal， with normal-appearing open angles in both eyes. Goldmann applanation tonometry measures was 10 mmHg in both eyes， with a central corneal thickness of 501 um and 506 um in the right eye (RE) and left eye (LE)， respectively. Fundoscopy revealed a cup to disc ratio of 0.8 bilaterally. In general physical examination， we found microstomy and puffy hands with pitting scars .\n\n【7】OCT revealed a decrease in the inferotemporal sector of the Peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (ppRNFL) and ganglion cells on the RE and a decrease in the inferotemporal and su-perotemporal sectors of the ppRNFL and ganglion cells on the LE . Macular OCT-Angiography showed a decrease of vessel density with a geographic agreement with the RNFL thinning of the OCT findings .\n\n【8】Automated Static Perimetry (ASP) (Humphrey， central 30-2) of the RE revealed pericentral scotomas in the upper hemifield， and lower nasal step defect and ASP of the LE revealed peri-central scotomas in 10° of eccentricity in the four quadrants and nasal step defects between 10° and 30° .\n\n【9】The Water Drinking Test (WDT) and Diurnal IOP curve were performed and showed a significant fluctuation. Regarding the WDT， this procedure involved the ingestion of 1 liter of mineral water in 5 minutes， and Goldmann IOP measurements 15， 30， 45and 60 minutes later. The test was considered positive if the IOP variation was 26mmHg. The baseline IOP was 12 mmHg bilat-erally， and IOP variation of the RE was 6 mmHg (corresponding to IOP peak value of 18 mmHg)， reached after fifteen minutes. IOP variation of the LE was 8 mmHg (corresponding to IOP peak pressure value of 20 mmHg)， reached after five minutes. The diurnal IOP curve involved IOP measurements during of-fice hours from 8.30 a.m. to 8.30 p.m. every hour. IOP at 8.30a.m. was 10 mmHg， and the IOP peak pressure was 16 mmHg， reached at 6.30 p.m.， bilaterally.\n\n【10】24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring highlighted nocturnal hypotension and nocturnal diastolic blood pressure decrease (dipper profile). The mean arterial values found were95/55 mmHg. Carotid and Vertebral Doppler Imaging were normal. After a clinical chart review， we found the diagnose of Progressive Systemic Sclerosis (PSS)， made by a Rheumatol-ogist， according to the diagnostic criteria of American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and classification criteria for systemic sclerosis (SSc). In order to reduce IOP fluctuation and increase ocular perfusion pressure， she initiated latanoprost once daily. Additionally， we recommended increasing salt and fluid intake at night and daily physical exercise to improve vascular circu-lation status. She was also referred to her rheumatologist， to adjust hypotensive arterial therapy to prevent intense pressure dips.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Although the pathogenesis of NTG remains unknown， according to the vascular theory of Glaucoma， vasospasm or inappropri-ate vasoconstriction may cause inadequate perfusion of neural tissues， resulting in optic nerve head damage and subsequent vi-sual field loss. Regarding this theory， some investigators have reported the association between NTG and immune-related dis-eases， reinforcing the role of systemic conditions in Glaucoma neuropathy development. PSS is a connective tissue autoim-mune disease characterized by fibrosis， degenerative changes， and vascular abnormalities that can involve the skin and internal organs， through three characteristic abnormalities： a fibroblastdysfunction， a vascular abnormality and an immune response. Despite the data， the pathophysiology of Glaucoma associ-ated with PSS remains unknown. Theoretically， besides vascular changes within the optic nerve， alternative damage could also result from fibrosis， restricting the outflow aqueous humour out-flow. This process involves several cytokines and grows factors， such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endothe-lin . Recent data support the endothelin system playing an important role in IOP homeostasis， by increasing aqueous humour outflow and decreasing aqueous humour formation， which should decrease IOP measurements . As a result，most descriptions of Glaucoma and PSS have found IOP values <21mmHg， which hinders Glaucoma diagnosis and makes the man-agement of the disease particularly challenging. Because of our suspicion of NTG，beyond routine exams like OCT，OCT-A and ASP， we performed WDT and diurnal IOP curve to figure out IOP fluctuations.\n\n【13】WDT is a stress test， validated and reproducible which de-termines the competency of trabecular meshwork and has an agreement with the diurnal IOP curve. In our case report， despite basal IOP measurements around 10 mmHg at our office visits， in the diurnal IOP curve and after WDT， the values suffer-ing a fluctuation of 26 mmHg with related IOP peak pressures in both tests between 16 mmHg and 18 mmHg. This fluctuation， combined with the alteration of systemic blood pressure present in our case report， can negatively influence the progression of Glaucoma.\n\n【14】As a result， we decided to initiate therapy with intraocular hypotensive drugs according to current literature， to lowering IOP by 30% from baseline pressure measurements， reaching low normal levels， in order to decline the rate of progression . Besides， we referred the patient to a rheumatologist， in order to adjust her medication therapy， because of the evidence of hy-potensive mechanisms of pentoxifylline， nifedipine and Evening Primrose Oil. The primary objective was to avoid nocturnal dips， that can also be harmful to Glaucoma progression， and， at the same time， prevent other organ involvement， as a consequence of PSS.\n\n【15】In our case-report， we established a link between NTG and PSS and this observation conducted our management of the disease. We suggest that all the patients with PSS or other sys-temic rheumatic diseases that course with vascular dysfunction to have an ophthalmology examination to rule out NTG.\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】This case reminds us of the importance of a holistic view of patient data， to treat our patients properly， avoiding the trend to underestimate patient complaints or miss some significant clinical findings. In someone with a suspicious disc cupping and normal IOP， we must investigate and exclude possible etiologies of NTG. Past medical history or current medication could be the missing piece of the puzzle for the correct diagnosis， and a multidisciplinary team can give substantial complementary indications. Often this is the most important step to achieve the best possible outcome for each patient.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

In most cases， patients show symptoms or electrocardiographic abnormalities and expected survival is consider-ably low.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 72-year-old man was admitted to our cardiology ward with suspected endocarditis 2 months after a right hemiglossectomy for a squamous cell carcinoma. He was asymptomatic and showed no electrocardiogram ab-normalities. Echocardiography showed an iso-ipoechogenic round-shaped formation at the right ventricle apex that was suspected to be a metastasis owing to 2 cardiac magnetic resonance imaging examinations show-ing a significant increase in its volume over 14 days. The patient was evaluated by a multidisciplinary team and referred for first-line chemotherapy with carboplatin， 5-fluoruracil， and cetuximab. He died after almost 4months of follow-up.\n\n【4】Conclusions： This case presents a very rare diagnosis as well as some unique features， including the intramyocardial local-ization， the absence of symptoms， and electrocardiogram abnormalities. Our report shows the relevance of im-aging techniques in defining even the most unusual clinical findings， and it emphasizes the significance of ear-ly recognition of cardiac masses in order to identify the appropriate medical or surgical therapy for patients.\n\n【5】Keywords： Cardiology·Echocardiography· Head and Neck Neoplasms· Magnetic Resonance Imaging•Neoplasm MetastasisCardiac tumors represent a rare， yet challenging diagnosis and can be differentiated into primary tumors (rates between0.001% and 0.3%) and secondary tumors (ranging from 2.3%and 18.3%) . In theory， the heart can be metastasized by any malignant neoplasm， but antemortem diagnosis is very rare because clinical manifestations are subtle or even absent，es-pecially at an early stage . At more advanced stages， how-ever， metastatic tumors gradually lead to heart failure， con-duction disturbances， or valvular disease resembling mitral stenosis， anginal pain， or Stokes-Adams syndrome . Cardiac metastasis is more frequently detected accidentally， usually at surgery or autopsy (in 2.3-7.1% of cases) .\n\n【6】In order of frequency， tumors metastasize to the pericardium， endocardium and valves， and the myocardium. The mecha-nisms of metastasis to the heart remain uncertain，but explan-atory hypotheses include hematogenous spread via the coro-nary arteries， retrograde lymphatic extension， and intracavitarydiffusion either by the inferior vena cava or by pulmonary veins . Lymphatic spread tends to give rise to pericardial metastases， as seen in lung and breast cancer， owing to their topography； whereas， hematogenous spread leads to myocar-dial metastases . The most common primary tumors that produce cardiac metastasis are melanoma， carcinoma of the bronchus， breast carcinoma， and lymphoma. Due to their pro-pensity for generalized hematogenous spread， malignant mel-anomas frequently metastasize to the heart in this manner； whereas， esophageal and breast cancers metastasize to the heart predominantly by lymphatics .\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】A 72-year-old man received a diagnosis of tongue carcinoma in December 2018. He subsequently underwent a right sub-total hemiglossectomy with right lateral neck dissection and a\n\n【9】Hz Dist1.16cm\n\n【10】Dist1.58cm\n\n【11】C45\n\n【12】P Bassa\n\n【13】AGen\n\n【14】79bom\n\n【15】reconstruction with a fasciocutaneous flap from the left thigh. Histological examination revealed poorly differentiated (G3) ulcerated squamocellular carcinoma infiltrating the muscular tissue and various metastatic lymph nodes (pT3， N2b， M0). About a month after surgery the patient was admitted to the Emergency Department for a surgical wound infection and dis-missed with an oral antimicrobial therapy.\n\n【16】In January 2019， computed tomography-positron emission to-mography (CT-PET) was performed and showed hypermeta-bolic activity in the patient's tonsils and laterocervical lymph nodes. A hypermetabolic signal (standardized uptake value， maximum 15.1) was also shown in the heart at the ostium of the mitral valve and near the apex of the right ventricle. These images were thought to be suggestive of a septic thrombus. The patient was admitted to our cardiology ward with suspected endocarditis.\n\n【17】The patient presented no symptoms and， in particular， he did not report chest discomfort， palpitations， dyspnea， or syncope. Physical evaluation was normal， and an electrocardiogram (ECG) showed no significant abnormalities. The patient’s C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were slightly in-creased. With few clinical data to confirm or exclude the sus-pected diagnosis of endocarditis， a better characterization of the hypermetabolic signal areas shown by CT-PET was essential.\n\n【18】Atransthoracic echocardiography (TTE)  was done， and it showed an iso-ipoechogenic round-shaped formation at the right ventricle apex， with no signs of vascu-larization. The patient next underwent a cardiac magnetic res-onance imaging (MRI) scan  for better tissue characterization. A round-shaped mass with a diame-ter of 17 mm， hardly distinguishable from the right ventricular wall， was found. The mass showed a hyperintense signal in T2-weighted images and in T1-weighted scans with late gadolin-ium enhancement and a hypointense signal in T1 scans withearly gadolinium enhancement. These findings were sugges-tive of cardiac metastasis.\n\n【19】The patient was re-evaluated by a multidisciplinary team of oncologists， radiologists， and maxillofacial surgeons. A second TTE  and a follow-up MRI scan were done 14 days later and showed significant augmentation in the sizes of the right ventricular lesion (34x25x34 mm) and infiltration of the right ventricularfree wall and the pericardial adipose tissue. This formation also showed， in the patient's intracavitary portion， a nodular extension wedged between the right ventricular trabeculae with synchronous movement in cine sequences.\n\n【20】Table 1.

During the first weeks of his hospital stay， the patient had also developed a subcu-taneous lesion that appeared as a protuberance in the right frontal area that rapidly increased in volume. This lesion was not evident on admission， nor was it reported on the initial CT-PET. It was also investigated with an MRI scan of the headand neck district， and findings suggested that it was a metas-tasis. An incisional biopsy of the lesion was then performed， and the results were compatible with the localization of a squamocellular carcinoma.\n\n【24】From February to April 2019， the patient received 2 cycles of first-line chemotherapy according to the scheme carbopl-atin area under the curve (AUC) of 5 on day 1， 5-fluoruracil800 mg/m2/d from day 1 to day 5 every 21 days， along with the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor drug cetuximab， at a loading dose of 400 mg/m² for the first cycle and then at the standard dose of 250 mg/mweekly . Treatment toxicitywas assessed every 3 weeks， according to the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.\n\n【25】Moderate renal toxicity with moderate anemia， associated with electrolyte imbalances， was recorded. The ECG started to show some changes， including repolarization abnormalities in the anterior leads that were not present in the first ECG. Moreover， a central venous catheter infection (that required removal of the catheter) was reported. Objective response was clinical-ly evaluated before every cycle and by imaging after the 2 Cy-cles. The patient was restaged by radiological imaging with a contrast-enhanced CT scan. The patient's objective response rate was assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria . The patient experienced progression of disease due to the appearance of a new cardi-ac metastasis. Because of disease progression， chemothera-py was definitively suspended， and the patient received sup-portive care during the rapid decline of his physical condition. The patient died in April 2019.\n\n【26】Discussion\n\n【27】Head and neck tumors represent an extremely rare source of cardiac metastasis， with fewer than 15 cases described in the medical literature  . Differential diagnosis has to include a number of clinical conditions. In our case， the main imaging finding at admission was a hypermetabolic mass de-scribed in the apex of the right ventricle and at the ostium of the mitral valve. The suspected diagnosis on admission was endocarditis. This hypothesis was subsequentially excluded based on clinical findings. The patient did not show any clin-ical characteristics of endocarditis. His levels of C-reactive protein and other inflammatory markers were just slightly al-tered， and his blood cultures were repeatedly negative. In ad-dition， the TTE images were also highly atypical for endocar-ditis， with a round-shaped mass detected near the apex of theright ventricle. Other possible causes of cardiac hypermeta-bolic signals are primary tumors of the heart， but they are 40times as rare as secondary tumors (with a reported prevalence in autopsy series of 0.001-0.3%). Furthermore， the most com-mon tumor in this group is the myxoma， which generally shows very low or absent 2-F\\]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) up-take . Blood thrombi can occasionally present as circular masses， but they tend to show no FDG uptake .\n\n【28】The main clinical findings that supported the diagnosis of a myocardial metastasis， even in the absence of a direct histo-logical confirmation， were the tissue characterization and dem-onstration of tissue infiltration based on MRl and the signifi-cative volumetric increase of the mass in a limited time frame. The diagnosis was also reinforced by the detection of a sub-cutaneous metastasis that suggested widespread disease.\n\n【29】We believe that our case presents a series of particularities that stand out even in the frame of a very rare diagnosis. In our literature search we observed that symptoms or electro-cardiographic abnormalities were reported in most cases. In contrast， our patient remained completely asymptomatic for months and did not show any significant abnormality in his initial ECG. We also believe that our case can be considered unusual for the intramyocardial localization because most re-ported patients showed pericardial or intracavitary metasta-sis. Life expectancy is considered to be of few weeks in most patients， while our patient had a survival of about 4 months.\n\n【30】Conclusions\n\n【31】The paucity of antemortem diagnosis of cardiac metastasis emphasizes the importance of early recognition of cardiac masses in order to determine appropriate medical or surgi-cal therapy for patients.

Risk factors include genito-urinary instrumental-ization and immunocompromised states. Because of the lack of guidelines on the diagnosis， management， and follow-up of SA prostate abscess， the diagnosis can sometimes be challenging. Our patient was a 60-year-old man who initially presented with lower back pain and was diagnosed with a methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia， prostate abscess， osteomyelitis， and myositis.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 60-year-old man presented with lower back pain. He had a past medical history of incompletely treated MSSA cervical osteomyelitis with epidural abscess， alcohol use disorder， intravenous drug use (IVDU)， and poorly con-trolled diabetes mellitus (DM). He was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Laboratory test results revealed leukocytosis and an elevated C reactive protein (CRP). Lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed vertebral osteomyelitis and right psoas myositis. Blood cultures isolated MSSA. The patient was treated with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. On day 5， our patient reported having fever， chills， flank pain， and dysuria. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a 4.0x4.9 cm prostatic abscess. CT-guided percutaneous abscess drainage was performed， and fluid culture revealed MSSA. Both antibiotics were discontinued and cefazolinwas started following sensitivities. Post-drainage pelvic ultrasound (US) showed resolution of the abscess.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】This case highlights the importance of a rapid diagnosis of SA prostate abscess in patients with document-ed risk factors and characteristic symptoms. Timely management with antibiotics and drainage as indicated are imperative to avoid further complications from the underlying bacteremia， including sepsis and metastat-ic infections.\n\n【6】Keywords： Abscess· Bacteremia · Case Reports ·Myositis·Osteomyelitis·Prostaterare cause of prostatic abscess  and only a few cases have been reported. Risk factors for SA prostate abscess include uri-nary tract instrumentalization or damage， bladder voiding dis-turbances， and immunocompromised states . Despite the absence of clear guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate abscess， physicians should promptly recognize and treat prostate abscess， as delayed management can lead to complications， including urosepsis and septic shock . Our patient was a 60-year-old man who initially presented with lower back pain and was diagnosed with a methicillin-sensi-tive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia， prostate ab-scess， osteomyelitis， and myositis.\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】History of Present Ilness\n\n【9】A 60-year-old man presented with a 1-week history of lower back pain， worse on flexion of the right thigh. He also report-ed a week-long course of poorly localized， pressure-like chest pain， lasting a few minutes. He denied any fever， chills， malaise， dysuria， flank pain， nausea， vomiting， abdominal pain， consti-pation，headache， shortness of breath， palpitations，or cough.\n\n【10】Past Medical History\n\n【11】Our patient had a history of incompletely treated MSSA cer-vical osteomyelitis with epidural abscess 2 years prior， coro nary artery disease (CAD) and coronary artery bypass graft(CABG). He had chronic alcohol use disorder， long-term intra-venous drug use (VDU) on methadone， and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (DM).\n\n【12】Physical Examination\n\n【13】On admission， the patient had a temperature of 36.5℃(97.7°F)， a blood pressure of 183/104 mmHg， a pulse of 87/min， and a respiratory rate of 20/min， with an oxygen saturation 100%on room air. Cardiac auscultation showed a systolic murmur predominant in the tricuspid area， lungs were clear to aus-cultation bilaterally， and a spine examination showed lumbar spine tenderness. The rest of the physical examination was within normal limits.\n\n【14】Laboratory Studies\n\n【15】Laboratory studies revealed leukocytosis of 32.22x10/mcL with neutrophilic predominance of 90%， and a C reactive protein(CRP) of 331 mg/L. His troponin level was normal. Urinalysis was negative for nitrites， leukocytes esterase， bacteria， leu-kocytes， and red blood cells. A chest X-ray did not show any new infiltrate， but revealed surgical metal sutures and medi-an sternotomy. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a normal sinus rhythm without evidence of ischemia. Blood and urine cultures were sent and the patient was empirically started on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.\n\n【16】Imaging and Initial Management\n\n【17】Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine with contrast on day 2 showed patchy marrow edema and enhance-ment within L2 and L3 vertebral bodies， suggesting osteomyeli-tis， along with right psoas myositis， and phlegmon of paraver-tebral soft tissues. No drainable abscess was seen； therefore， surgical intervention was not indicated. A transthoracic echo-cardiogram (TTE) on day 4 did not rule out valvular vegetation， and showed unquantified tricuspid regurgitation， moderately elevated right ventricular systolic pressure (40-50 mmHg)， and a normal left ventricular ejection fraction， diastolic dysfunc-tion， chordae， and mitral leaflet calcification. The diagnosis of tricuspid valve infective endocarditis was considered. The pa-tient was initially treated with i.v. vancomycin and piperacil-lin-tazobactam for broad antibiotic coverage for osteomyelitis， right psoas myositis， and paravertebral soft tissue phlegmon. On day 4， blood and urine cultures yielded MSSA sensitive to cefazolin. We discontinued piperacillin-tazobactam and van-comycin， and started i.v. cefazolin. The patient remained afe-brile， with reduction in inflammatory markers (white blood count 16x10/mcL and the CRP 259.8 mg/L). On day 5，the pa-tient reported having subjective fever， chills， flank pain， and dysuria. He denied hematuria or straining on urination. A dig-ital rectal exam revealed a tender prostate without bogginess or fluctuance. Differentials included acute bacterial prostatitis and prostate abscess. A contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the right hip demonstrated a 4.0x4.9 cm peripheral-ly enhancing fluid collection suggestive of prostatic abscess. Blood cultures remained positive for MSSA. The di-agnosis of MSSA prostate abscess was made. The question of whether the prostate abscess was the source of the bactere-mia or a metastatic infection secondary to MSSA bacteremia remains unknown.\n\n【18】Treatment and Follow-Up\n\n【19】CT-guided percutaneous abscess drainage was performed on day 8 ， and abscess fluid culture grew MSSA. He was continued on i.v. cefazolin. Follow-up pelvic ultrasound afterdrainage on day 13 showed an enlarged prostate measuring3.18x4.87 cm， without abscess . Prostate fluid culture vielded MSSA sensitive to cefazolin. His condition remained stationary， his back pain was controlled with hydromorphone， and he remained afebrile. Laboratory values showed decreas ing white blood cell count (13.26x10/mcL). The subsequent 3blood cultures were negative. The patient was discharged on day 20 on i.v. cefazolin to complete 6 weeks of treatment， hy-dromorphone for pain control， methadone， and insulin.\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】Prostate abscess can be a diagnostic challenge. We present a case of MSSA prostate abscess discovered on day 5 of admis-sion in a patient with a history of incompletely treated MSSA epidural abscess， IVDU， and poorly-controlled DM. Our patient initially presented for low back pain， and on day 5 started re-porting flank pain， subjective fever， chills， and dysuria.\n\n【22】Prostate abscess is a rare condition. Gram-negative Enterobacteria， especially E. coli， are the leading pathogens causing prostate abscesses ， while SA remains an uncom-mon cause， with most cases secondary to MRSA . However， studies have shown that invasive MSSA is a public health prob-lem in the United States， and the incidence of MSSA infections was 1.8 times higher than MRSA in 2015 . SA prostate ab-scess mostly occurs in patients with a history of urinary tract instrumentalization (eg， biopsy or surgery) or damage (eg， per-ineal injury)， bladder voiding disturbances， immunocompro-mised patients (including IDU and DM)， and patients with bacteriemia J.IVDU， poorly-controlled DM， and incom-pletely treated MSSA epidural abscess were notable risk fac-tors in our patient. He initially presented only with lower back pain， while fever， chills， dysuria， and flank pain were noted on day 5 of admission. Similarly， the most common symptoms re-ported in the literature were abdominal or perineal pain， fe-ver， and urinary symptoms such as dysuria， urinary retention，\n\n【23】Conclusions\n\n【24】This case highlighted the importance of a rapid diagnosis of SA prostate abscess in patients with documented risk factors and characteristic symptoms.

Kommerell's diverticulum is a rare formation originating from persistent dorsal aortic roots . It generally gives rise to an aberrant subclavian artery and is commonly associated with right aortic arch .\n\n【7】In this paper we present a case of right aortic arch with an aberrant left subclavian artery originating from Kommerell's diverticulum which results in dysphagia.\n\n【8】CASE REPORT\n\n【9】A 28-year-old male presented with one month of solid food dysphagia. He had no prior history of any gastroenterologic disease. His general physical examination was completely normal. His routine biochemical tests and complete blood count were all within the normal limits.\n\n【10】Since his chest roentgenogram was consistent with a right aortic arch he was referred for a detailed radio-logic evaluation to identify any co-existing vascular malformations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MR)， and multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) angiography were planned to search any other vas-cular abnormalities. Cardiac MR examination was performed with a 1.5T scanner using balanced-turbo field echo (B-TFE) (TR， 3.0； TE， 1.5； flip angle，80； slice thickness， 8 mm) and three-dimensional(3D) T1-weighted fast field echo (FFE) (TR， 4.9； TE， 1.4； flip angle 40； slice thickness， 1.5 mm) se-quences. Contrast-enhanced 3D T1-weighted FFE sequence was used to generate MR angiograms by using maximum intensity projection (MIP) algo-rithm. Contrast-enhanced thoracic CT angiography was performed with a 16 channel MDCT scanner by using 16X1.5 collimation， 2-mm.-slice thickness，1-mm reconstruction interval， 0.5 sec rotation time， and 1.2 pitch. Post-processing of the raw data with a three-dimensional (3-D) volume rendering technique and two-dimensional (2-D) multiplanar reformatted images generated high quality vascular maps.\n\n【11】MR angiograms， axial CT images and coronal refor-matted images confirmed the right-sided aortic arch and depicted proximal descending aortic diverticulum， from which the left subclavian artery originates . Order of other main arteries was as follows： first， left common carotid artery was aroused from the proxi-mal ascending aorta and followed by right common carotid and right subclavian artery. The right aortic arch was passing posteriorly to the esophagus and the Kommerell’s diverticulum was located lateral to the esophagus where it makes an impingement on esopha geus.Esophageal compression and mild displacement， which is responsible for the dysphagia was better illus-trated by axial CT scans .\n\n【12】The patient was recommended a surgical correction for relief of symptoms but he denied.\n\n【13】DISCUSSION\n\n【14】Burchardt Kommerell was the first to define the diver ticulum that still bears his name in 1936 in a patient presenting with dysphagia . Right aortic arch with an aberrant left subclavian artery is the most commonpresentation of Kommerell’s diverticulum This anomaly is a result of regression in the 4h left aortic arch between the left carotid and left subclavian arteries and the Kommerell's diverticulum is the remnant of dorsal aorta. In most of the cases left subclavian artery arises from the right-sided aortic arch as the 4branch and passes behind the esophagus to the left arm. The descending aorta can be right sided or left sided . The right aortic arch usually lies retroesophageally. Retroesophageal aortic arch， ligamentum arteriosum， pulmonary arteries together constitute a vascular ring around the esophagus. The ring is generally loose and therefore asymptomatic. But in cases of aberrant subclavian arteries passing posterior to the esophagus the ring becomes narrower and may cause symptoms related to compression of trachea or esophagus. Also if exists， Kommerells diverticulum may cause an additional compression.\n\n【15】In our case the first branch of the right aortic arch is the left common carotid artery， the second branch is the right common carotid artery， and the third is the right subclavian artery. The fourth branch is the left subclavianartery， which arises from Kommerell’s diverticulum locating at the junction of the right arch and the right descending aorta . In our case the aberrant left SCA was not passing posteriorly but as it was seen from the axial CT both the retroesophageal arch and the Kommerell’s diverticulum were compressing the esophagus . Our case differs from the other few cases reported in the literature in that aspect . The diverculum itself may cause compression and be responsible for the symptoms.\n\n【16】MR and CT angiography are both noninvasive imag-ing tools in the evaluation of heart and vessels . MR does not use ionizing radiation； however， CT better demonstrates the airways and pulmonary pa-renchyma as in our case. In patients with dysphagia， chest radiography should performed before more invasive procedures to be able to depict abnormal vas-culature and if present， CT and MR imaging should be the second line investigation methods.\n\n【17】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【18】In conclusion， we present a patient with Kommerell's diverticulum associated with right aortic arch showing retroesophageal course which causes dysphagia", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

This is a highly invasive infection that arises on the background of an immunocompromised state and can cause extensive necrosis and bony destruction of the paranasal sinuses， orbit and surrounding tissues. In addition to antifungal drugs， treatment often involves aggressive surgical debridement including exenteration of the orbit. We describe four cases of mucormycosis that presented soon after treatment for SARS-COV2 pneumonia and their radiological findings and discuss risk factors， treatment and preventive measures.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Mucormycosis， Black fungus， maxilllectomy， paranasal sinusitis\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】We present a case series of invasive mucormycosis in patients with a history of COVID-19 infection. We discuss the prevalence of fungal co-infection in COVID-19， as well as the diagnostic and management challenges.\n\n【4】Case presentation\n\n【5】Case 1\n\n【6】A 51-year-old female， diabetic on oral anti-hypoglycemic agents， presented with a history of mild covid pneumonia one month back， was hospitalized for 15 days and treated with methylpred-nisolone and remdesivir. She was discharged with the same corticosteroid and nintedanib. Two days after discharge， she started developing headaches， jaw pain， periorbital swelling， reddish nasal discharge and right cheek swelling. On examina-tion， her right cheek was swollen and tender， with inflammation seen in the right half of the gingiva and palate. There was bleed-ing to touch， with no blackish discolouration or discharge. Her vital parameters were normal. Investigations showed randomblood sugar (RBS) 230 mg/dl (normal < 140mg/dl) and HbA1C of 9.4% (normal <6.4%). MRI paranasal sinus (PNS) and correl-ative CT scan were done. Fig 1a (CT PNS bone window axial cut) shows right-sided invasive fungal sinusitis with the erosion of the wall of the right maxillary sinus， right superior alveo-lus， ipsilateral palatal process and extension to the left superior alveolar and palatine process. Fig 1b (MRI PNS Coronal T2view fat-suppressed) shows oedema in the right premaxillary and pterygopalatine fossa region. Fig 1c (MRI PNS Axial T1 fat-suppressed post-contrast) shows absent mucosal enhancement along the anterior wall of the right maxillary sinus with abnor-mal enhancement in the right perimaxillary and pterygopalatine fossa region. She was taken up for functional endoscopic si-， nus surgery (FESS)， debridement and extended max ctomy. D Because of difficulty in feeding， a percutaneous endoscopic gas-trostomy (PEG) tube was inserted. Tissue culture grew Rhizopus species. Post-operatively， she was started on intravenous liposo-mal amphotericin B at 5mg/kg/day and continued to do well， with adequate wound healing.\n\n【7】Case 2\n\n【8】A 66-year-old female， known hypertensive， presented after be-ing treated for COVID pneumonia in the previous month with remdesivir and corticosteroid， then discharged with corticos-teroid. She gradually progressed， painful right eye swelling for ten days， from the day after discharge， associated with de-creased vision. There was a right-side nasal block and blood-stained nasal discharge. Her vital parameters were normal. RBS was 130 mg/dl and HbA1C 9.2%， and other investigations werenormal. The right eye examination showed proptosis， perior-bital swelling， absent eye movement， and pupil dilated and unresponsive to light. Nasal endoscopy showed black eschar along the wall and septum of the right nostril and the right side of both soft and hard palate. MRI PNS and correlative CT showed signs of mucormycosis. In Fig 2a (MRI PNS Axial T2)， the green arrow shows mucosal thickening in right anterior eth-moid air cells， and the red arrow shows right intra-orbital fat stranding causing proptosis. Fig 2b (MRI PNS T1 Post-contrast coronal view) shows the 'black turbinate'sign， a patchy area of non-enhancement in the right inferior turbinate， compared to the left inferior turbinate. Fig 2c (MRI PNS T1 fat-suppressed post-contrast axial view) shows non-enhancing areas in the right cavernous sinus - a sign of possible thrombosis. She under-went emergency right total maxillectomy， orbital exenteration， septectomy and nasal bone removal， along with PEG tube in-sertion. Tissue examination showed broad， aseptate， hyaline， wide-angle branching fungal hyphae， suggestive of mucorales. Post-operatively， she was started on Tab Posaconazole 300mg due to the non-availability of Amphotericin-B for the initial two days. Her remaining hospital stay was uneventful.\n\n【9】Case 3\n\n【10】A 46-year-old male patient with no known comorbidities pre-sented with severe left eye pain， swelling and left frontal headache for 3 days. He had been hospitalized for about 25days in the previous month with COVID-19 pneumonia and treated with corticosteroids and antibiotics. At discharge， he had left-sided migraine， treated with dexamethasone. He pre-sented with RBS of 177 mg/dl and HbA1C of 7.8%， and other tests were normal. On examination， he had breathlessness on exertion and talking， but vital parameters were normal. Left eve examination revealed evelid oedema， conjunctival conges-tion and pre-septal abscess， but vision and eve movements were intact. CT Orbit and MRI PNS have done elsewhere were sug-gestive of rhino mucormycosis with pansinusitis. He underwent emergency left side medial maxillectomy， ethmoidectomy and sphenoidotomy and FESS. Tissue culture grew absidia species. He was started on intravenous lyophilized amphotericin-B at1mg/kg， as the liposomal formulation was unavailable. Renal parameters and platelet counts were monitored daily. Liposo-mal amphotericin-B was available from post-operative day 4and started at 5mg/kg/day iv. The remaining course in the hospital was uneventful.\n\n【11】Case 4\n\n【12】A 65-year-old male， known diabetic， was diagnosed with Covid-19 pneumonia 45 days back and treated with antibiotics and parenteral steroids. He now presented with swelling and numb-ness of the right side of the face， gradually worsening for 1month associated with toothache and loosening of teeth. RBS was 163 mg/dl and HbA1C 9.2%. CT scan and MRI PNS were done. Fig 3a (CT PNS soft tissue window coronal view) shows right maxillary sinus mucosal thickening with fat stranding in retroantral， pterygopalatine and right orbit. Fig 3b (MRI PNS T1 fat-suppressed post-contrast axial view) shows abnor-mal enhancement in the right premaxillary and pterygopalatine fossa region. He underwent right-sided total maxillectomy， eth-moidectomy， sphenoidotomy， inferior and middle turbinectomy， and debridement of infratemporal fossa and vidian canal， along with PEG tube insertion. Tissue culture grew Rhizopus species.\n\n【13】Postoperatively， he was started on Tab Posaconazole 300mg twice daily due to the non-availability of amphotericin-B. Tis-sue culture yielded zygomycetes. The remaining course in the hospital was uneventful.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Mucormycosis，known by the more ubiquitous term black fun-gus， is a life-threatening，angioinvasive infection caused by fungi in Mucorales， which has a predilection for skin， nasal sinuses and lungs. Its prevalence in India is estimated to be around 70times higher than globally.  Disseminated mucormycosis has a rapidly progressive course，characterized by direct invasion and necrosis of nasal and sinus mucosa followed by invasion into the orbit， brain， lung and other organs. The most com-monly isolated genera include Rhizopus， Mucor，Rhizomucor and Absidia. Cunninghamella is a rare but more virulent strain. Overall mortality is 40-80% and is dependent on various factors and underlying co-morbidities， with higher mortality seen in disseminated mucormycosis.\n\n【16】The present case series highlights the rapid onset and destruc-tive nature of this disease-all four patients presented follow-ing SARS-COV2 pneumonia treated with corticosteroids and had high blood sugars at admission. Duration of symptoms ranged from 2 days to 1 month before presentation. Symptoms were unilateral and included eye pain， swelling and numbness. The common radiological findings were inflammation of the paranasal sinuses with the destruction of surrounding bones and extension into the orbit.\n\n【17】Mucormycosis associated with COVID-19 infection in India was first reported in Surat， Gujarat， in May 2021， and sincethen， it has rapidly increased in number. The hyperinflamma-tory response seen in coronavirus infections along with an im-munosuppressed state resulting from the use of steroids and immunosuppressive agents has been hypothesized to create a favourable environment for fungal coinfections.  Other risk factors for mucormycosis include hyperglycemia， injudicious use of steroids， inappropriate antibiotics， immunodeficiency states such as HIV and post hematopoietic stem cell transplant， iron overload， chelating agents， prolonged ICU stay， malnutri-tion， infected linens and use of unsterile water in humidifiers.\n\n【18】Clinical features vary from mild cutaneous illness to fulmi-nant， disseminated infections. Clinical features include fever(44%)， headache， cheekbone pain， nasal blockage (38%)， black or bloody nasal discharge， diplopia， decreased vision (30%)， pe-riorbital pain and oedema (34%). In addition， hard/Soft palate examination shows blackish pigmentation， which is a hallmark for mucormycosls.\n\n【19】Cutaneous mucormycosis is the most common type and car-ries the most negligible mortality (4-10%)， characterized by in-durated plaques， nodules and ulcers. Pulmonary mucormycosis is the second most common and causes dyspnoea. As seen in these case series， Rhino orbital mucormycosis is most commonly noted in people with diabetes. Disseminated mucormycosis has the highest mortality.\n\n【20】Initial investigations include complete blood count， which may decrease absolute lymphocyte count， renal function test， blood sugars and serum ferritin. High serum ferritin may pose a risk factor for Mucorales infection since fungi thrive in an iron-rich environment. Radiological investigation of choice is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast， which shows loss of contrast enhancement. Computed tomography(CT) is less sensitive than MRI and is used for tissue sam-pling and surgical planning. Extrasinus invasion and loss of contrast enhancement are sensitive signs of invasive fungal sinusitis， as seen in the figures in these case series. This non-enhancement is attributed to diseased tissue， which is prone to necrosis and devitalisation. The black turbinate’ sign on MRI PNS with contrast is one such sign of non-enhancement in the turbinates - a feature that can aid in early diagnosis of mucormycosis. Confirmation is by histopathological exami-nation of CT- or endoscopy-guided tissue biopsy samples， using direct microscopy， culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Management of mucormycosis requires a multimodal approach involving antifungal therapy and surgical debridement.Hy-perglycemia and metabolic acidosis provide a favourable envi-ronment for fungal growth and must be treated. Concurrent debridement of necrotic tissue and antifungal therapy with lipo-somal Amphotericin-B1.5mg/kg/day or Posaconazole 300mg twice daily or Isavuconazole 372mg once daily are shown to improve survival. Lyophilized Amp-B 1.5mg/kg/day， Isavu-conazole and Posaconazole are alternatives if Liposomal Amp-B is unavailable. Lyophilized Amp-B and Posaconazole require cautionary usage in renal dysfunction， monitoring renal param-eters and platelet count. Adjuvant therapies like hyperbaric oxygen have proven useful in the management of mucormy-cosis. However， expert opinion should be sought prior to its usage. Stepwise re-debridement or debulking surgeries may be required. Antifungals should be continued till clini-cal and radiological resolution， which usually takes 4-6 weeks\n\n【21】Prevention of mucormycosis includes measures such as using clean linen  and sterile water in humidifiers. Simple bedside tests like ocular motility， conjunctival reflexes， sinus tenderness， ocular swelling， and palatal examination can help detect mucormycosis in hospitalized patients.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】The above case series highlights the morbidity and difficult management decisions associated with invasive mucormyco-sis. SARS-COV2 patients on systemic corticosteroids should be monitored for early warning signs of this disease. In addi-tion， restricted use of steroids and tighter glycemic control with improved hygiene practices can help prevent.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The classic triad of ECCL are skin， ocular， and central nervous system involvement， includ-ing conditions such as unilateral porencephalic cyst，ipsilateral lipomatous hamartoma of the scalp-eyelids-eye globe， cortical atrophy， cranial asymmetry developmental delay， seizures， mental retardation， and spasticity of the contralateral limbs. The dermatological hallmark is a hairless fatty tissue nevus of the scalp called nevus psiloliparus.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】An 11-year-old right-handed boy born at full term， was referred to our clinic. His family had no consanguini-ty or history of neurocutaneous disease. The patient's physical examination revealed a large hairless lesion on the right frontoparietal scalp called nevus psiloliparus. Beginning from the birth， a dermolipoma (an uncom-mon benign tumor) was reported to have occurred on the conjunctiva， mostly ipsilateral in his right eye and present on the ipsilateral side of the neurological abnormalities shown on magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. The patient had muscle weakness in left upper and lower extremities. He had a mild form of mental retardation.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】There is no specific treatment for ECCL. Management of ECCL is usually symptomatic. Surgical correction of a cutaneous lesion can be performed for cosmetic improvement. An early diagnosis of ECCL allows for early symptom treatment and improved patient quality of life.\n\n【6】MeSH Keywords： Epilepsy， Absence· Lipoma· Neurocutaneous Syndromes\n\n【7】Haberland et al. first reported encephalocraniocutaneous li-pomatosis (ECCL) in 1970 and defined it as a new type of ec-tomesodermal dysgenesis . It has also been referred to as Fishman's syndrome . Although it was first described in 1970， only around 60 cases have been reported since then. The clas sic triad of ECCL is skin， ocular and central nervous system in-volvement， which have included specific conditions such as unilateral porencephalic cyst， ipsilateral lipomatous hamar-toma of the scalp-eyelids-eye globe， cortical atrophy， cranial asymmetry， developmental delay， seizures， mental retardation and spasticity of the contralateral limbs. Despite most find-ings being unilateral， a few bilateral cases have been report-ed . The dermatological hallmark is a hairless fatty tissue nevus of the scalp which is also known as nevus psiloliparus .\n\n【8】Because differential diagnosis is difficult to define for this spe-cific disease， ECCL can be reported in the literature as multi-organ neuroectodermal syndrome. These patients generally present to dermatology clinics for alopecia and neuropsychi-atry departments for problems with school success and edu-cation in childhood.\n\n【9】Our case was a child misdiagnosed as hydrocephalus and re-ferred to our clinic for a shunt operation. As there is no spe-cific treatment for ECCL， the management is usually symptom-atic， and any surgical correction of the cutaneous lesion is for cosmetic improvement.\n\n【10】Case Report\n\n【11】An 11-year-old right-handed boy， who was born at full term， presented to our clinic. His parents declared no complication at birth and a normal bodyweight. His family reported no con-sanguinity or neurocutaneous disease history. The patient had first presented to a pediatrician at a neurosurgery department at six months of age due to febrile convulsion. At that time， computed tomography (CT) of the brain showed clear cranial asymmetry and hydrocephalus. A shunt operation for hydro-cephalus was recommended if the patient had further seizures and sent the patient was sent home without any treatment. Subsequently， the child had tonic-clonic seizures three times in one day at the age of nine years. At that time， the pedia-trician started the patient on carbamazepine 150 mg twice a day. After 15 months， the patient had seizures again and the carbamazepine dose was increased to 300 mg twice a day. However， even under this treatment， there was no control of the patient's seizures. The patient was referred to our clinic for further evaluations and neurosurgery suggestions.\n\n【12】Our physical examination revealed a large hairless lesion on the right frontoparietal scalp called nevus psiloliparus . Beginning from the birth， a dermolipoma (an uncommon benign tumor) had been developing on the conjunctiva， mostly ipsi-lateral in his right eye as a lipomatous hamartoma ； the ipsilateral cranial abnormalities were revealed in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CT scan .\n\n【13】His eyes were examined and reported as normal. He had a mild form of mental retardation. He had muscle weakness in his left upper and lower extremities. His proximal muscle group strength of the left upper extremity was 4/5 and the distal ex-tremity was 3/5. The muscle strength of left lower extremity was 4/5. There was hypoesthesia on the left extremities. Deepdilatation of the right lateral ventricle occipital horn， deletion of temporo-occipital gyri and sulci irregularity with cortical thinning and diffuse white matter volume decrease and subdural effusion.\ntendon reflexes were brisk on the left extremities and normal on the right extremities. Planter response was positive on the left and negative on the right foot. Cardiovascular and respira-tory system examinations were normal. Electroencephalogram(EEG) showed left frontocentral and right frontocentroparietal focal epileptiform activities.\n\n【14】The patient's antiepileptic medical treatment was organized， and seizures stop. He was referred to the psychiatry depart-ment for suggestions of education life.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Antenatal diagnosis of ECCL is not usually made because the intracranial malformations noted on an antenatal sonogram are not specific for ECCL . Etiology of ECCL remains unknown and is not associated with gender， race， or geography. A postzy-gotic gene mutation is suspected in genetic causes with an au-tosomal mutation in mosaic form . Dysgenesia of the ante-rior neural tube and cephalic neural crest is thought to occur in embryo-pathogenesis. Neural crest derivatives， dermis and hypodermis of the face and neck， dermal bones of the skull， head mesenchyme，truncoconal septum，odontoblasts and me-lanocytes are affected by ECCL. Mental retardation and sei-zures are also seen. The best radio-diagnostic test are CT and MRI to determine the cranial neurological pathologies of ECCL\n\n| System  | Major criteria  | Minor criteria  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Skin  | 1\\.

The original diagnostic criteria for ECCL proposed by Hunter in 2006， was revised by Moog in 2009  . The revised criteria include defi-nite/proven and possible ECCL cases but exclude a third group of probable ECCL as defined by Hunter . In the revised Moog criteria for ECCL， there are one major and three minor criteria involving the ocular system， three major and five mi-nor criteria involving the cutaneous system， and three major and six minor criteria for CNS involvement . Three major criteria also involve the other systems. In our patient case， ne-vus psiloliparus， corneal hamartoma， proencephalic cyst， cal-cification around the cyst， and asymmetrically dilated ventri-cles were present and thus it was defined as a definite case based on this classification system .\n\n【19】The pattern of skin and ocular findings is very consistent and recognizable in ECCL The most important skin anomalies arenon-scarring alopecia with or without underlying fatty tissue and subcutaneous fatty masses. Hairless fatty tissue nevus of the scalp is the dermatological hallmark and referred to as ne-vus psiloliparus. Subcutaneous fatty masses are seen unilat-eral or bilateral in the frontotemporal or zygomatic region. A rare ECCL with small congenital melanocytic nevus involving70% of the body surface of the patient was also reported by Ahmed et al. Ocular anomalies reported in the literature include choristoma，epibulbar or limbal dermoids， ocular and palpebral colobomas， aniridia， micropthalmia， calcification of globe， and irregular or disrupted eyebrows .\n\n【20】The most frequently reported intracranial anomaly is intracra-nial lipoma on radiological examinations. Other abnormalities reported include enlarged lateral ventricle， porencephalic cyst， widened subarachnoid space， arachnoid cyst， corticopial cal-cifications， cortex with dysplasia， leptomeningeal angioma-tosis， tapered corpus callosum， and a lack of normal insularopercularization . Spinal lipomatous lesions as intradural extramedullary lesion have also been reported in ECCL . Skeletal lesions， congenital heart defects， and urogenitalanom-alies have also been seen， although rare.\n\n【21】Haberland and Perou reported on the histological evaluation of the brain in ECCL and found lamination defects of the ce-rebrum，calcification on the outer membrane of porencephal-ic cysts， and polymicrogyria . Histopathological examina-tions of the skin colored papules and nodular tags represent lipomas， fibromas， fibrolipomas， and cartilage with hamarto-matous tissue . Focal dermal fibrosis is associated with subcutaneous fat widening into the reticular dermis in alope-cic region of scalp.\n\n【22】The differential diagnosis includes Proteus syndrome， seba-ceous nevus syndrome， and oculocerebrocutaneous (OCC) syndrome . Sebaceous nevus syndrome is also associat-ed with seizures and mental retardation， but the cutaneous lesions are mainly on the midline of the face. Proteus syn-drome presents in the head， limbs， and trunk progressively，bilaterally and asymmetrically， but brain alterations are rare-ly seen， whereas ECCL is non-progressive， unilateral， and lim-ited to the head. However， some authors consider sebaceous nevus syndrome as a continuum of phenotypic expression of ECCL， and ECCL as a localized form of Proteus syndrome. In differential diagnosis， scalp alopecia and facial lipoma are ab-sent in OCC syndrome .\n\n【23】Conclusions\n\n【24】There is no specific treatment for ECCL； management includes symptomatic treatment and surgical correction of cutaneous lesions for cosmetic improvement. If the diagnosis could be made earlier， the care of symptoms and the quality of life of the patient would be improved.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The purpose of this study is to quantify the dose received by the heart and the Left Anterior Descending artery in left-sided breast cancer patients treated in our institution. Methods and Materials： Patients with breast cancer who had undergone mastectomy or Breast Conservation Surgery and who had indications for post-operative radiotherapy were subjected to a fractionation schedule of 50Gy in 25 fractions to the chest wall or breast using Three Dimensional Conformal Radiotherapy. Dose Volume Histogram for the heart and the Left Anterior Descending artery were generated. Results： The average mean and maximum dose received by the heart was 14.12 Gy and 53.29 Gy， respectively. The average mean and maximum dose received by the Left Anterior Descending artery was 46.6 Gy and 52.5 Gy， respectively. Findings： The mean and maximum dose received by the heart and Left Anterior Descending artery are high in this study. This could be due to differences in target volume delineation and the higher percentage of mastectomy patients in our study. This study highlights the importance of delineating the heart and the Left Anterior Descending artery as organs at risk and the benefit of using cardiac sparing techniques for protecting the heart and coronary vessels\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Breast Cancer， Radiation， Cardiotoxicity， Heart， LAD\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Breast cancer represents the most common female malignancy in both the developing and developed world and is the primary cause of death in women globally.\n\n【4】Radiotherapy plays an integral role in the management of breast cancer. The use of RT after mastectomy or lumpectomy has shown to improve local control， breast cancer-specific sur-vival and overall survival. Breast cancer is becoming an in-creasingly survivable disease with advances in diagnosis andtreatment. Thus the focus has shifted to long term treatment-related toxicity. It has been postulated that the moderate pro tection offered by radiotherapy may be counterbalanced by a moderate increase in the risk of death. The 'Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group' reported excessive mortality from heart disease in patients receiving radiation therapy2. Cardiac mortality is reported to be higher in left-sided breast cancer pa-tients than in right-sided breast cancer patients because higher cardiac radiation doses were delivered.\n\n【5】This study aims to assess the approximate radiation dose received by the heart and major coronary vessels in left-sided breast cancer patients treated with chest wall irradiation in our institute so that the likely cardiac morbidity and mortality for these patients may be predicted by comparing with the doses received by patients irradiated in the trials mentioned above for which the risks are known in patients with left-sided breast cancer.\n\n【6】To quantify the radiation dose received by the heart and the left anterior descending artery in left-sided breast cancer radiation.\n\n【7】To determine whether there is a correlation between the type of surgery and the dose received by the Heart and the Left anterior descending artery.\n\n【8】Materials and Methods\n\n【9】Study population\n\n【10】Patients with Carcinoma Left Breast registered in the Depart-ment of Radiotherapy， Government Medical College Hospital， Kozhikode， from January 2014 to July 2015 who had undergone either breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy and who had indications for post-operative radiotherapy. This study was con-ducted after obtaining ethical clearance from the Institutional Ethical Committee. Patients were enrolled after obtaining writ-ten informed consent. All patients were treated with a tumour dose of 50Gy to the isocenter in 25 fractions， five days per week. The dose distribution was calculated with full three dimensional CT density information， including lung correction， using the Anisotropic Analytical Algorithm (AAA).\n\n【11】Simulation\n\n【12】The patient was placed in the supine position with both the arms flexed and abducted to more than 90 degrees. Both hands were made to hold the handgrip placed on the board above the head. The arms were held in position by arm supports attached to the board， and the head was turned to the right. A headrest and a hip rest were also used to aid in patient reproducibility.\n\n【13】Target delineation\n\n【14】The tangential field borders were determined clinically and marked by radio-opaque wires. The medial border was 1cm from the mid-line or the medial end of the mastectomy scar. The superior border was at the caudal border of the clavicular head. The inferior border was 1 cm below the inframammary fold， and the lateral border was at the mid-axillary line. A contrast-enhanced CT scan was taken with the patient in the treatment position from the level of the C6 vertebra to below the level of the diaphragm. The chest wall or breast CTV， the regional lymphatics and the supraclavicular field (when indicated) were contoured according to the RTOG guidelines， and the reference radio-opaque wires placed. The organs at risk assessed were the heart and the Left Anterior Descending Artery (LAD). The heart and the LAD were contoured with the aid of a heart contouring atlas，“Development and Validation of a Heart Atlas to study Cardiac exposure to Radiation following treatment for Breast Cancer\". For each treatment plan， dose-volume histograms(DVHs) for the heart and the LAD were generated with a 1-cm radial margin. The superior limit of the heart included the right and left atria and excluded the pulmonary trunk， ascending aorta， and superior vena cava. The caudal border of the my-ocardium was taken as the inferior limit of the heart. Because of its short length， the left main coronary artery was assessed with the LAD artery. Thelocation of the LAD artery was also identi-fied using the course of the anterior interventricular groove. A radial margin of 1 cm was added to the left anterior descending artery contour to allow for uncertainty in the identification of ar-terial position， respiratory movement and the beating movement of the heart. For each organ at risk， the mean and maximum dosewas assessed for each patient. For each of these quantities，the average value over all assessed patients (referred to as“average mean\" or “average maximum\") was calculated together with its standard deviation (SD). \n\n【15】Treatment planning\n\n【16】Computerised Tomography data was exported to a comput-erised treatment planning system (Eclipse， Version11). Beam weights and wedges were optimised based on the dose distribu-tion for the central axis plane. All patients were planned with either 6MV or 15MV photons. Field borders were not modified to reduce or avoid cardiac irradiation， and cardiac shielding was not used. All patients were treated with a tumour dose of 50Gy to the isocenter in 25 fractions， five days per week. The dose distribution was calculated with three dimensional CT density information， including lung correction using the AAA. \n\n【17】Statistical analysis\n\n【18】Data were entered in Microsoft Excel & analysis was done using the SPSS version 20.0 software and analysed with the help of descriptive statistics such as mean， standard deviation， percent-age and statistical tests such as Independent T-test were applied appropriately.\n\n【19】Results\n\n【20】Twenty-seven patients had participated in our study， with the mean age being 47.6 years. Ten patients (37%) in our study pre-sented with locally advanced disease. These patients had to undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery. The major-ity of the patients in our study (66.6%) had T2 disease. Only four patients (15%) had negative nodes on axillary staging. The majority of the patients (55%)had N1 disease. Only four patients(15%) had undergone breast-conserving surgery (BCS)， while 23patients (85%) had undergone mastectomy (MRM).\n\n【21】Quantification of Radiation Dose to the heart and the LAD：\n\n【22】The average mean dose received by the heart was found to be1401.4 Gy (SD 434.8) which accounted for 28% of the total dose. A correlation was found between the mean dose received by the heart and the type of surgery. The average mean dose received by the heart in patients who had undergone mastectomy was1484.3cGy (SD 383.6)， and in BCS patients were 869.4 cGy (SD288.2). The average mean dose received by the heart was higher in mastectomy patients when compared to BCS patients. The correlation was statistically significant. (p=0.005) (Bar Graph 1) The average maximum dose received by the heart in our study was 5334.2cGy  which accounted for 106% of the total dose. The mean percentage of the heart volume in the treatment field was found to be 24%. A correlation was found between the percentage of heart volume in the field and the type of surgery. The mean percentage of heart volume in the treatment field was25.8% for mastectomy patients， while that for BCS patients was13.7%. So the volume of the heart receiving more than 25 Gy was higher for mastectomy patients than in BCS patients， and this correlation was found to be statistically significant (p=0.009). The average mean dose received by the LAD was 4629 cGy (SD591.7) which accounted for 93% of the total dose.\n\n【23】A correlation was also found between the mean dose to the LAD and the type of surgery. The average mean dose received by the LAD in mastectomy patients was 4814cGy (SD 322)，and in BCS patients were 3560cGy (SD 699.6). The mean LAD doses were more significant for patients who have undergone mas-tectomy when compared to breast-conserving surgery， and this correlation was statistically significant (p<0.001). (Bar Graph 2)\n\n【24】The average maximum dose received by the LAD was 5242cGy (SD 188.1) which accounted for 105% of the total dose. The average percentage of the volume of the LAD in the treatment field (that is， receiving more than 25 Gy) was 91.7%(11.8). A correlation was also found between the volume of the LAD in the treatment field and the type of surgery. The average percentage of LAD volumes in mastectomy patients was 95.1%， and for BCS patients were 72.5%. Greater volumes of LAD was in the treatment field for mastectomy patients when compared to BCS patients，and this difference was found to be statistically significant (p=0<0.001).\n\n【25】Discussion\n\n【26】Radiotherapy has played an important role in preventing breast cancer deaths while increasing the risk of cardiovascular mor-tality. Radiation-induced heart disease， the most common be-ing pericarditis， started becoming a significant problem when large volumes of the heart were exposed to>40Gy. Another manifestation was cardiomyopathy . Late manifestation of radiation-induced heart disease includes an unexpectedly high incidence of ischemic heart disease. Left-sided breast cancerhas been associated with higher mortality due to ischemic heart disease than the right . A population-based case-control study of major coronary events in women who underwent radi-ation for breast cancer showed that the major coronary events increased linearly with mean dose to heart by 7.4% per grey with no apparent threshold .\n\n【27】Table 1 Comparison of Mean Dose received by the Heart in different studies.\n\n| Study  | Mean Dose received by the heart  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1970s  | 13.3Gy  |\n| 1990s  | 4.7 Gy  |\n|  | 2.3 Gy  |\n| 2010  | 0.8 Gy  |\n| Present Study  | 14.12 Gy  |\n\n【29】Table 2 Comparison of Mean Dose received by the LAD in different studies\n\n| Study  | Mean Dose received by the LAD  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1970sl  | 31.8 Gy  |\n| 1990s  | 21.9 Gy  |\n|  | 7.6 Gy  |\n| 2010  | 6.7 Gy  |\n| Present Study  | 46.2 Gy  |\n\n【31】Table 3 Comparison of the maximum dose received by the LAD in different studies\n\n| Study  | Maximum LAD dose  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1970sl  | 52 Gy  |\n| 1990sl  | 51.5 Gy  |\n|  | 35.2 Gy  |\n|  | 40.3 Gy  |\n| Present Study  | 52.5 Gy  |\n\n【33】Mean Dose received\n\n【34】Graph 1： Mean dose received by the heart for MRM patients versus BCS patients.\n\n【35】Graph 2： Mean dose received by the LAD for MRM patients versus BCS patients.\n\n【36】In our study， the average mean dose received by the heart was found to be 1401.4 Gy (SD 434.8) which accounted for 28%of the total dose. This was high when compared to western data. A correlation was found between mean dose received by the heart， percentage of heart in the field， and type of surgery. These were higher in mastectomy patients when compared to BCS patients， and the correlation was statistically significant. The average mean dose received by the LAD was 4629 cGy (SD591.7) which accounted for 93% of the total dose. This value was also found to be high when compared to available data. \n\n【37】An association was also found between the mean dose to the LAD and the type of surgery. The mean LAD doses were greater for patients who have undergone mastectomy (4814cGy) when compared to breast-conserving surgery (3560cGy)， and this correlation was found to be statistically significant (p<0.001). This was also seen in a study by Bartlett et al. in which he found that the mean LAD NTDmean and LADmax in Gray were significantly greater for patients who underwent mastectomy：5.9 (SD 3.6) versus 8.7 (SD 5.3)，p=0.004 and 38.2 (SD 11.3) versus45.5(SD 3.6)， p<0.01 . The average maximum dose received by the LAD was 5242 cGy (SD 188.1) which accounted for 105%of the total dose.  The average percentage of the volume of the LAD in the treatment field (that is， receiving more than25 Gy) was 91.7%(11.8). In the Taylor et al. study， the volume of the LAD in the treatment field was 13%. Greater volumes of LAD was in the treatment field for mastectomy patients (95.1%) when compared to BCS patients (72.5%)， and this difference was found to be statistically significant (p=0<0.001).\n\n【38】In this single-institution study， the mean radiation dose to the heart and the LAD， the maximum dose to the heart， and the LAD were high when compared to similar studies conducted in the West. The volume of the heart and the LAD in the treatment field were also found to be higher.\n\n【39】The probable reasons why the heart and the LAD received a high dose in our study could be due to a higher percentage of mastectomy patients in our study when compared to Western data， where they studied more BCS patients. It has already been shown that mastectomy patients received more radiation dose than BCS patients.\n\n【40】Another reason for the difference may be due to differences in target volume delineation. We had taken the medial end of the CTV to be the medial end of the mastectomy scar， which extended up to the midline in most patients. Also， the field borders were not modified to reduce the cardiac dose. The lateral border was taken as the midaxillary line as recommended by the RTOG guidelines.\n\n【41】In the studies available in the literature， the contoured images show that the medial and the lateral borders of the CTV did not reach up to the recommended anatomical landmarks. So the heart and the LAD were almost outside the field. This may explain the wide disparity seen between the present study and Western data. \n\n【42】Conclusion\n\n【43】This study highlights the importance of contouring the heart and the LAD as organs at risk in breast cancer radiation， especially in left-sided disease and the importance of adopting cardiac sparing techniques. A more planned surgery limiting the medial and lateral extent of the mastectomy scar might prevent larger fields from being included in the CTV， which in turn may re-duce the radiation dose to the heart and the LAD. The choice of breast conservation surgery may be encouraged as the preferred option in patients in whom there is no contraindication， so that the radiation dose received by the heart and the LAD may be reduced. This study is limited by the small number of patients studied and the smaller proportion of BCS patients.\n\n【44】Abbreviation\n\n【45】·AAA： Anisotropic Analytical Algorithm\n\n【46】·BCS： Breast Conservation Surgery\n\n【47】·CTV： Clinical Target Volume\n\n【48】· LAD： Left Anterior Descending Artery\n\n【49】·MRM： Modified Radical Mastectomy", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

When taken in a fasting state， more than 80% of the drug can be absorbed ， but there are conditions where absorption of thyroxin is limited， e.g. due to taking the medication simul-taneously with food， beverages， or co-medication such as es-trogen， proton pump inhibitors， calcium products， ferrous sul-fate， rifampicin， phenytoin， carbamazepine， lovastatin， and sertraline . Furthermore， absorption can be reduced by a variety of diseases of the upper gastrointestinal tract， e.g. gastritis， short bowel syndrome， inflammatory bowel diseas-es， lactose intolerance， or celiac disease . Besides oral sup-plementation， intravenous application of levothyroxine is an alternative in cases of myxedema coma when the patient is not able to take his or her medication orally . However， to our knowledge， only one report exists of subcutaneous ap-plication of thyroxin to treat chronic hypothyroidism when oral T4 supplementation does not seem to be sufficient . In this context， we describe hypothyroidism resistant to oral administration of levothyroxine effectively treated by subcu-taneous injection to increase its awareness among the med-ical community.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】A 42 year old Caucasian female was referred to our clinic with persistent symptomatic hypothyroidism due to subtotal thy-roidectomy for benign multi-nodular goiter eight years ago de-spite being treated with an increased dose of 400 pg levothy roxine and 20 ug thyronine. The patient reports having tried several different dosage forms including tablets from different pharmaceutical companies and drops yielding the same result without improving symptoms or laboratory values.\n\n【7】On presentation she complained about a depressive mood with fatigue， cold intolerance， hair loss and progressive weakness. Furthermore， she reported a weight gain of about 50 kg since the operation. According to her past medical history she had been suffering from depression with an unsuccessful suicide attempt 5 years ago.\n\n【8】Baseline thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)， free triiodothy-ronine (fT3)， and free thyroxine (fT4) were 19.1 mU/l (normal range： 0.4-4.0 mU/)， 3.2 ng/ml (normal range： 2.1-4.3 ng/ml)， and 6.67 ng/ (normal range： 8-18 ng/l)， respectively， reveal-ing primary hypothyroidism. Autoimmune serology was neg-ative for microsomal， thyroideaperoxidase， or TSH-receptor antibodies. Further， creatinkinase (171 U/l； normal range upto 170 U/l) and total cholesterol (234 mg/dl) were slightly el-evated. Diabetes mellitus was ruled out with an HbAlc level of 5.3% and a normal oral glucose tolerance test. To exclude other endocrinological reasons for weight gain a 24-hour urine collection was performed in order to exclude hypercortisolism. Further laboratory tests were normal.\n\n【9】On physical examination the patient had a body temperature of 35.6℃， her blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg， her heart rate was 72 beats per min. Her weight was 150 kg resulting in a body mass index of 53 kg/m2. Further examination was con-sistent with hypothyroidism with the patient having dry skin and nonpitting edema on feet and lower legs as well as on；sh the back of her hands. Her deep tendon reflexes showed de-layed and weak relaxation. The remainder of the examination was uneventful. Ultrasound was consistent with thyroidecto-my showing small residual tissue on both sides of 2.1 ml and of hypoechoic structure.\n\n【10】First， the patient was instructed how to take her medication. During a stay on an endocrinological ward it was proven that the patient was taking her prescribed medication as recom-mended， at least thirty minutes before breakfast with water only. Care was taken that the thyroxin medication was tak-en in a fasting state without concomitant therapy. No tab-lets could be detected in her mouth after swallowing， mak-ing sure the tables were taken correctly. After four weeks of treatment while having no effect on blood values and symp-toms， the intake was delayed to bedtime， being likely to in-crease absorption in some cases . This， however， did nei-ther improve TSH nor fT4 values. Next， the dosage of thyroxin was increased about 100 pg every 4 weeks over the first two months of treatment. However， with a dosage of 600 pg of le-vothyroxine and 20 ug of thyronine， no improvement of symp-toms or in TSH， fT4， and fT3 levels was observed. Therefore，a more rapid dosage regime was chosen and the dosage was in-creased about 200 pg every 4 weeks resulting in a daily dose of 2200 pg per day of levothyroxine after eight months and80 pg thyronine was added to the medication. However， nei-ther the patient's complaints nor laboratory values improved during therapy .\n\n【11】Additionally， to rule out gastro-intestinal disease， a gastrosco-py was performed showing antrum gastritis as the only path-ological result and excluding celiac disease with biopsies and antibody tests. Moreover， an oral D-xylose absorption test re-vealed decreased levels of D-xylose one and two hours after application of 25 g D-xylose in the blood as well as low urinary excretion implicating malabsorption .\n\n【12】However， since doses up to 2200 pg levothyroxine and 80 pg of thyronine were insufficient to achieve any improvements it was decided to inject 500 pg of levothyroxine (L-Thyroxin\n\n【13】Table 1. D-Xylose test.

Replacement therapy with subcutaneous thyroxin injec-tion was continued with 500 pg on a once weekly basis. Due to the high sample volume of 10 ml it was recommended to split this dosage on two injection sites. After 14 days of sub-cutaneous injection treatment fT4 (12.77 ng/l； normal range：8-18 ng/l)， and fT3 (2.93 ng/l； normal： 2.0-4.2 ng/l) were with-in normal range and TSH improved considerably， dropping to4.11 mU/l (normal range： 0.4-4.0 mU/l) . Five months later， TSH was finally normalized at 2.66 mU/l and re-mained so on another follow-up visit seven months after the first subcutaneous injection with fT3 and fT4 always staying within normal range. Furthermore， not only laboratory valueswere normalized but fatigue and depressed mood improved significantly. Due to alternating relapse of these symptoms over the weekly period after injection， injection intervals were truncated to 500 pg every four days resulting in sustained clinical improvement.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Mode of application\n\n【18】In this case， we report that subcutaneous application of le-vothyroxine might be an effective therapeutical approach in rare cases where patients do not respond to oral therapyon a long-term basis. In our patient rapid improvement of hypothy-roidism with regard to clinical symptoms and laboratory data concerning TSH， fT4， and fT3 was evident after changing the method of application from oral to subcutaneous. In most cas-es with refractory hypothyroidism， intravenous application was a successful treatment option . To our knowledge，only one report exists describing off label subcutaneous use of thyrox-in inject . In that report， however， subcutaneous injections were described as painful most likely deriving from the large sample volume of 10 ml per injection suggesting substitution via intramuscular application . However， in our patient thesplit dose regimen with two injections of 5 ml each was well tolerated over a period of seven months of follow-up. The ad-vantage of subcutaneous injections is that patients can easi-ly perform it themselves.\n\n【19】Reasons for failing therapy (compliance， pseudomalabsorption， malabsorption)\n\n【20】Some antidepressants can interfere with TSH levels. Since our patient did not take any other medication besides levo-thyroxine and thyronine， this is unlikely to be the cause for her high TSH values.\n\n【21】The most frequent cause of hypothyroidism in the setting of excessive oral supplementation of levothyroxine may be poor compliance with medication . In this context， pseudoma-labsorption of levothyroxine has been noticed as clinical prob-lem itself， which can be examined by controlled supplementa-tion of levothyroxine . In our case the patient was taught about the way of levothyroxine intake several times and was additionally treated for hypothyroidism in hospital. Therefore， it was unlikely to be the cause of persistent hypothyroidism.\n\n【22】However， true malabsorption， especially in obese patients， can be subtle and difficult to recognize due to its superficial clini-cal appearance . Besides gastrointestinal diseases like ce-liac disease， Helicobacter pylori infection， atrophic gastritis， lactose intolerance， chronic inflammatory bowel diseases， or parasitic diseases like Giardiasis ， pancreatic and liver dis-eases， dietary interference with different kinds of juice， coffee\n\n【23】Conclusions\n\n【24】We believe that subcutaneous application of levothyroxine is an effective alternative in cases of hypothyroidism refractory to oral treatment. Further studies are needed to better estab-lish indications， outcomes， and adverse events of this therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Prostaglandin E1(PGE1) has been used since 1973 for cardiovascular diseases， mainly in patients with advanced peripheral vascular disease. In addition， PGEl intra-venous infusion has shown to be beneficial in limb-threatening ischemia， especially when reconstructive procedures are not feasible. The original research of benefitted 28 cases in the last 5 years is presented here. Background： As general surgeons or physicians， we do not have many options to treat rest pain due to peripheral vascular disease (PVD) involving small and medium size vessels. We use only analgesics from the enteral， parenteral， or dermal patch. Pain due to PVD is severe and described as a “cry of dying nerves\" and does not respond to analgesics. Lumbar sympathectomy did show some relief in the olden days but obsoleted as relief is only for a few months. Therefore， we could not improve patients'quality of life with these medications. Enough of the medical literature says prostaglandins E1 improves microcirculation， stop tissue damage due to ischemia and relief rest pain. Methods： In this study， we included both gender patients above the age of 31 years who had ischemic changes and rest pain associated with PVD. We treated these patients with intravenous prostaglandins E1and studied them for relief from rest pain as well as further ischemic changes. Results： clinical success was evaluated according to subjective grading and relief of pain. Patients in these studies had a pain score from 6 onwards as per Wong-Baker FACES pain rating scale improved to 0-4. We also studied them for the Fountain and Rutherford staging and scoring system， which improved from III b to II-I and 4 to 2-1， respectively. Conclusions： Intravenous infusion of PGEl alprostadil on 5 days a cycle basis in selective patients with severe rest pain and ischemia seems very effective， without any serious complications.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Extremities rest pain， ischemic ulcer， peripheral vascular disease， intravenous prostaglandin infusion\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) is an endogenous prostaglandin used as a medication.

Von Euler found that seminal fluid and seminal vesicles from most animals， including men， contain a substance which causes contraction of the smooth muscle of the uterus. He named this new substance“prostaglandins\" since they were originally thought to be secreted by the prostate gland. PG E1(PGE1) was first isolated in 1957 by Bergstrom and Sjovall. In 1976， prostacyclin was discovered as a potent platelet function in-hibitor and a strong vasodilator. These pharmacological proper-ties were the reason that PGE1， as the first PG， has been widely used since 1973 for treating cardiovascular diseases， mainly in patients with advanced peripheral vascular disease. Patients were treated intra-arterially in whom vascular surgery or other therapeutic measures were not considered successful and whereamputation seemed unavoidable. The reported results were described as encouraging， and PGE1 was soon administered intravenously. However， no accepted dose regimen was devel-oped， and the first controlled study was not published until The clinical outcomes were discussed controversially. Since 1987， PGE1 (prostavasin) has been used predominantly intravenously\n\n【4】In many elderly patients aged between 50 and 75 years， the arterial disease is prevalent (upto7%)， and they present with in-termittent claudication. Lifestyle modification， control of hyper-tension， and statin therapy with adequate diabetes management can improve intermittent claudication. Also， we are seeing new developments in endovascular treatments， particularly better balloons， stents， drug-eluting stents and drug-eluting balloons， atherectomy devices， as well as many others that would allow us to treat better lesions that are blocking arteries and causing problems for patients. The problem， of course， is that all these new treatments are expensive， and they have to be proven effec-tive in terms of both outcomes and cost. On the other hand，PG infusion therapy has been helpful in patients where such new reconstructive procedures are not feasible or failed and as an adjunctive when there is residual ischemia after the revascular-ization procedure.\n\n【5】In our study PGE1infusion was given as a treatment of choice in patients with small and medium size vessel involvement. In these selected patients， interventional radiology and surgery were not possible.\n\n【6】The study aims to present our results after short-term (9weeks to 15 weeks) intravenous infusion therapy of PGE1-alprostadil via a peripheral line.\n\n【7】Methods\n\n【8】Twenty-eight patients (men and women 25：3；age range： 34-71yrs.) with severe rest pain (Rutherford stage 5 or Fontaine's stage Il) and Wong-Baker FACES 6 plus pains score were included in the study.\n\n【9】Twenty-one men were chronic smokers， and 5 were involved with both limbs in the age group of 31 to 45-yrs， typically sug-gestive of Buerger’s disease.\n\n【10】2 of the female patients had Raynaud's disease with upper extremities involvement. (group A)\n\n【11】4 males and 1 female had extensive peripheral atherosclerotic changes due to long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus. (group B)\n\n【12】The following pain scores were used for the study.\n\n| Rutherfordstage  | Fontainstage  | Descriptions  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 0  | T  | Asymptomatic  |\n| 1  | Ia  | Mitd claudication  |\n| 2  | Ib  | Moderate claudication  |\n| 3  | Ib  | Severe claudication  |\n| 4  | IIa  | Rest pain  |\n| 5  | Ib  | Ischaemic ulcers digits of the foot(minor tissue loss)  |\n| 6  | IV  | Severe ischaemic ulcers or gangrene(major tissue loss)  |\n\n【14】all patients were thoroughly worked up with haematological investigations， including haemoglobin， complete blood count， bleeding time， clotting time， blood sugar levels， Lipid profile，\n\n【15】Liver function test and renal function test. ECG and 2D echo were done for all patients.\n\n【16】Non-invasive arterial colour Doppler study was done for all patients to know flow， pressure， and collaterals.\n\n【17】CT angiography was done in selective patients.\n\n【18】In a few cases， patients showed a very poor run-off with total occlusion of all three vessels， dorsalis pedis， posterior tibial and anterior tibial.\n\n【19】Two female patients had Raynaud's disease with dry gan-grene of tips of the fingers of upper extremities with involvement of ulnar and digital arteries.\n\n【20】All patients suffered from significant rest pain， and one type of amputation could be considered the only potential treatment of choice.\n\n【21】All patients were admitted， and intravenous PGE1 therapy was given. We used an ampoule of 1ml containing 500 micro-grams of alprostadil for one cycle for an average of 50kg. and above the adult patient.\n\n【22】We took one ml of PGE1 derivative in a syringe and diluted it with 5 ml of distilled water. So， each ml contains 100 micro-grams of PGE1 which were added in 500ml of normal saline and infused slowly for 8 hours a day for five days. The same cycle repeated after 3 weeks. Three to six such cycles were infused into the patient.\n\n【23】The following things were monitored while giving infusion：\n\n【24】1\\. Vital signs for fever and bradycardia， BP for hypotension and ECG\n\n【25】2\\. Respiratory rate and respiratory depression or apnoea\n\n【26】3\\. Hypersensitivity to prostaglandin E1\n\n【27】Results\n\n【28】The peripheral intravenous line was taken， and infusion was given without significant complications.\n\n【29】All patients experienced a significant decrease in pain from the first cycle， which reduced further through the following cycles.\n\n【30】All 23 (group A) patients experienced moderate to almost complete relief in rest pain and stagnation of further ischemic soft tissue changes.\n\n【31】All 5 (group B) patients， due to diabetic atherosclerosis， expe-rienced a significant decrease in pain and improvement in ulcer healing.\n\n【32】No thrombophlebitis or any side effects of the drug occurred during the follow-ups. In addition， no significant changes were noted in any patient's brachial-tibial index or arterial Doppler.\n\n【33】Table 1 shows that all patients from Group A and Group B had improvement in all three scores. Diabetic pathology Group B PVD improved better than Group A， which includes Buerger's and Raynaud's disease. The scoring system of Fontain and Rutherford also shows improvement in ulcer healing. In brack-ets， a number of patients are mentioned.\n\n【34】Table 1 Pain Scores of patients before and after PGE1 infusion therapy.\n\n| Pain score system  | Group A before(23 patients)  | Group A after(23 patients)  | Group B before(5 patients)  | Group B after(5 patients)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fountain Score  | I-IV  | I  | H-IV  | a   |\n| Rutherford-Becker score  | 4  | 1-23  | 4  | 1-2  |\n| Wong-Baker Faces Pain  | 8-10  | 2-44-6  | 8-10  | 2-4  |\n\n【36】Table 2 Number of patients relieved of pain with cycles.\n\n| Number of Cycles  | Group A 15 patients  | Group B 5 patients  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cycle one  | 10  | 2  |\n| Cycle two  | 7  | 1  |\n| Cycle three  | 2  | 1  |\n| Cycle four  | 2  | 1  |\n| Cucle five  | 2  |  |\n\n【38】Table 2 shows the maximum number of patients who re-sponded to the first cycle of drug therapy and the remaining who responded to the next cycles.\n\n【39】It has been observed that there is a tremendous amount of recovery in rest pain after the first cycle in 12 (42.85%) of patients.8 (28.57%) recovered after the second cycle， 3 (10.71%) recovered after the third cycle and the remaining 5 (17.85%) recovered after two more cycles.\n\n【40】There were no further ischemic soft tissue damage and im-provement in wound healing.\n\n【41】All patients were continued on oral aspirin tablet 150mg once a day along with pantoprazole 40.\n\n【42】6 months to 4.s years long term follow-up done in all patients. All patients were taught exercises of limbs， good diet habits and lifestyle changes. Those patients who quit tobacco and had well control DM noticed good long-term results， mainly due to microcirculation improvement.\n\n【43】Discussion\n\n【44】The mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics of PGE1 is only partly understood as they seem complex.\n\n【45】It is important to note that the intravascular half-life of in-jection PGE1 is very short. However， the metabolites of PGE1are biologically active. Hence， the effects are prolongTherefore； someone assumes that the benefits of PGE1 are sustained longer than the presence of known metabolites (measured) in the labo-ratories.\n\n【46】Intravenous infusion of PGE1 in patients with severe periph-eral vascular disease has been well documented to be a safe and effective treatment method in this group of patients with a very limited-if any-choice of treatment However， the easiest speculated intravenous route needs a significantly increased PGE1 dosage (up to four times) to achieve the same as the arterial route effectiveness since up to 90% of PGE1 under-goes metabolic degradation by the first passage from the lung parenchyma. However， in our study， we did not encounter any drug complications.\n\n【47】Theoretically， a small portion of the total amount of PGE1does not reach the extremity. Additionally， we used in our proto-col the maximum quantity of PGE1 as described in the literature. These two factors contribute to maximum response and the best clinical outcome.\n\n【48】Our patient's clinical result enhances previous studies' results for good clinical short success. Clinically important relief from rest pain was achieved in all of the patients. The ten patients who had moderate responses were patients with Buergers' disease. Smoking may reduce the effectiveness of that type of treatment in this specific subgroup of patients.\n\n【49】According to the literature， many examinations exist that can objectively document perfusion changes in the area of interest. Evaluation with transcutaneous PO2，laser Doppler flow， and volume flow may show improvements in microcirculation and limb perfusion and have been adequately described . In our study， we tried only the arterial Doppler study， which showed no improvement in blood flow.\n\n【50】Conclusion\n\n【51】In conclusion， intravenous infusion of PGE1 via a peripheral line in patients with rest pain has good short-term clinical success by creating significant peripheral vasodilatation. We think this is a fascinating new figure in this type of treatment. However， further studies with more patients may be needed to document these observations.\n\n【52】We also know that the PGE1 infusions are safe and work in our patients by relieving the rest pain， healing the ulcers， and improving the limb salvage rates when the known revasculariza-tion procedures fail or are not feasible. However， the mechanism of action through biologically active metabolites must be un-derstood in more detail. Therefore， the future of PG infusion therapies depends on the progression of scientific research in un-derstanding the mechanism of action of PGs in arterial ischemia patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

In addition， pregnant patients who are unvacci-nated against SARS-CoV-2 have greater morbidity risk with severe COVID-19 disease as compared to patients of similar age and comorbidity status. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been deemed safe in pregnan-cy in other diseases. Prior data demonstrate the possible benefit of utilizing IVIG for the treatment in hospi-talized patients with severe respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19 active infections when adminis-tered within 14 days of COVID symptom onset.\n\n【2】Case Reports：\n\n【3】We administered IVIG (Privigen， CSL Behring) 0.5 g/kg daily for 3 consecutive days to 4 pregnant patients(ages 24-34 years of age) who were hospitalized with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 and not vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. All patients received concomitant glucocorticoid therapy. Gestational ages were 26， 17， 35， and 35weeks. All patients were discharged home breathing room air after a mean hospital stay of 15 days. Two pa-tients had uncomplicated cesarean section at 35 weeks during the hospitalization. The pre-term pregnancies at 17 and 26 weeks were intact at hospital discharge and resulted in normal vaginal deliveries at term. All 4patients consented to participate in this case series report.\n\n【4】Conclusions\n\n【5】IIG may be a safe treatment consideration in pregnant women with severe COVID-19 to avoid pregnancy complications. Its use warrants further study in pregnancy acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to SARS-CoV-2， influenza， and other respiratory viruses to which pregnant patients are vulnerable.\n\n【6】Keywords： COVID-19·Immunoglobulins，Intravenous · Pregnancy·SARS-CoV-2\n\n【7】Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been found to have broad therapeutic applications for the treatment of a variety of inflammatory， infectious， autoimmune and viral diseases， including Kawasaki disease via multifactorial mechanisms of immune response modulation . Several studies synthesized in a meta-analysis have shown benefit of IVIG treatment for COVID-192.\n\n【8】Previous studies have shown that acute lung injury in COVID-19may be mediated by the hyperimmune response driven by neu-trophil extracellular trap (NET) formations . IVIG may in-terfere with platelet activation， neutrophil activation and NET formation， thereby， mitigating lung injury.\n\n【9】Treatment options in pregnant patients with COVID-19 are lim-ited， largely due to their traditional exclusion from early clini-cal trials， including those assessing COVID-19 therapeutics . IVIG is not approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 hypoxia， nor is it recommended by the Centers of Disease Control (CDC) in the United States . However， IIG has been deemed safe in pregnancy as used for years to treat a variety of autoimmune conditions . Here， we report our successful treatment of 4 severely-and critically ill COVID-19pregnant patients with MIG.\n\n【10】The recommended treatment strategies for symptomatic con-firmed positive COVID-19 induced hypoxia requiring hospital-ization has been evolving over span of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of early April 2022， the CDC's treatment recommendations for COVID-19 confirmed positive adult hospitalized patientswere remdesivir 200mg intravenous (V) loading dose fol-lowed by remdesivir 100 mg lV daily for 4 doses starting 24hours after the loading dose plus dexamethasone 6 mg oral-ly or I daily for up to 10 days . As of April 4， 2022， there are no recommended treatment options for hospitalized and hypoxic COVID-19 positive pregnant patients not responding to remdesivir and dexamethasone . The Society of Maternal Fetal Medicine (SMFM) guidelines mention that to-cilizumab is not contraindicated in this special patient popula-tion， however， more data is needed before it is recommended due to the fact that the completed clinical trials have exclud-ed pregnant subjects . The SMFM guidance states that ob-stetrical medical providers may inquire about compassionate use of tocilizumab .\n\n【11】Details of the 4 cases of COVID-19 in pregnancy are provid-ed below. All 4 cases were administered IVIG with the United States brand name， Privigen@， manufactured by CSL Behring AG. We did not utilize anti-COVID-19 IVIG (C-IVIG) that is be-ing currently being studied in the clinical trials setting. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by nasal swab sam-ples sent to our hospital's laboratory using the approved RT-PCR technique. Cases 1-3 were encountered in the second COVID-19 wave in mid-2020. Case 4 was encountered in the4h COVID-19 wave in mid-2021 when the delta SARS-CoV-2variant accounted for the predominant burden of COVID-19in the United States and a period during which 3 efficacious vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 were readily available. None of the patients in this case series received COVID-19 vaccinations prior to admission.

This case series de-scribes 4 pregnant women with severe/critical COVID-19 dis-ease treated with IIG and had good outcomes in both moth-er and child. In one case， rapid improvement was immediately observed after therapy.\n\n【15】Case Reports\n\n【16】Case 1\n\n【17】A 34-year-old pregnant woman (26-weeks) with a history of asthma presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with 7days of dry cough， fever， myalgias， nausea， vomiting， and diar-rhea. Her SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing was positive 3 days prior to admission and confirmed COVID-19 positive by the hospi-tal's RT-PCR test soon after admission. A chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates. She was noted to be mildly hypoxemic and was admitted and placed on low-flow oxygen by nasal prongs and treated with remdesivir and dexamethasone 6 mg orally daily. Over the next 72 hours， she developed increasing respi-ratory distress and hypoxemia， progressing to high flow na-sal cannula and ultimately placed on mechanical ventilation on hospital day 4. Her clinical condition continued to deterio-rate and she became acidotic and required vasopressors. On hospital day 5， fetal heart rate monitoring showed signs of fe-tal distress and betamethasone was administered in anticipa-tion of emergency cesarean section delivery. Relevant clinical and laboratory data are provided in Table 1. Starting on hos-pital day 5， IVIG (Privigen@) 0.5 g/kg (adjusted body weight) was administered daily for 3 days， with methylprednisolone40 mg intravenously (IV) one hour before infusion. Within 24hours of the first IVIG infusion， she was weaned off vasopres-sor support， acidosis resolved and there were no more signs of fetal distress. After 11 days of mechanical ventilation， she was extubated on hospital day 14. Oxygen was weaned off and she was discharged home on room air on hospital day 21， with no pregnancy complications. She had a normal spontane-ous vaginal delivery at 37 weeks gestational age.Roughly one year post delivery， child is healthy with no complications per patient via telephone discussion. This case was also included in a prior retrospective case series of MG in COVID-19 .\n\n【18】Case 2\n\n【19】A 31-year-old woman pregnant at 17 weeks with no known significant medical history presented to the ED by ambulance with severe shortness of breath， dry cough， myalgia and fever for 10 days. When the Emergency Medical Service arrived at her home， she had a room air saturation 77% and respiratory rates in the 40s. She arrived at the ED on nonrebreather mask and room air blood oxygen saturation was 86%. In the ED， she was able to be converted from a nonrebreather mask to oxy-gen support via nasal cannula bringing the blood oxygen sat-uration above 93%. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing was positive 7days prior to admission and confirmed COVID-19 positive by the hospital's RT-PCR test soon after admission. Respiratory symptoms were escalated to severe in the ED such that she could not change position in bed without severe paroxysms of cough attacks and dyspnea. Her white count was noted to be normal with elevated transaminase levels， tachycardic with heart rate approximately 100 beats per minute and was afe-brile. Due to her severe dyspnea， chest Computed Tomography(CT) angiogram was performed to rule out pulmonary embo-lism. This showed no pulmonary embolism， but showed multi-focal bilateral pneumonia . While in the ED， her re-spiratory status continued to decline requiring high flow nasal cannula oxygen support and dexamethasone 10 mg IV every12 hours was initiated. Remdesivir was not initiated due to the prolonged duration of symptoms (<7 days) prior to pre-sentation. The patient was admitted to the COVID-19 non-ICU step-down unit. On hospital day one， IVIG (Privigen@) 0.5 g/kg(adjusted body weight) was administered daily for 3 days with-out methylprednisolone due to the high dose of dexametha-sone. Her respiratory status failed to improve， which required escalation to respiratory support with bi-level positive airway pressure (BIPAP) and she was ultimately transferred to the ICU. On hospital day 4， placed on mechanical ventilation and transiently required vasopressor support shortly afterwards. After stabilizing on mechanical ventilation， she subsequent-ly developed a very high fever， an increase in oxygen require-ments and increased secretions. Sputum culture showed heavy growth of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA)， placed on clindamycin 900 mg IV every 8 hours， subsequently became afebrile in 48 hours and the respiratory status start-ed to improve. After 8 days in the ICU， she was weaned off mechanical ventilation and transferred to the floor where she completed 7 days of clindamycin and 10 days of dexametha-sone. She was discharged home on hospital day 19 breathing room air and delivered vaginally at term. The child was with-out complications >1 year after admission per patient via tele-phone discussion.\n\n【20】Case 3\n\n【21】A 29-year-old pregnant woman at 35 weeks gestation and no known significant medical history presented to the ED with a history of fever of 7 days， positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCT positive test 3 days prior， worsening myalgias and dry cough. A chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates and she was admitted to the hospital. She declined remdesivir therapy， but accepted dexa-methasone 6 mg orally daily which was initiated on hospital day 2 due to hypoxemia. IVIG (Privigen@) 0.5 g/kg (adjusted body weight) was administered daily for 3 days， also starting on hospital day 2. Of note， methylprednisolone 40 mg IV was given one hour prior to the second dose of IVIG， only because she refused for it to be given prior to dose l and dose 3. A ce-sarean section was electively performed on hospital day 3 with-out complications. On hospital day 4， electrocardiogram was performed revealing ST elevation in several leads. Cardiology consulted and echocardiogram was performed，which revealed dilated right ventricle and tricuspid regurgitation. On hospi-tal day 5， CT angiography was negative  for pulmo-nary embolism and cardiac troponin serum concentrations re-mained normal. She was able to be weaned off supplemental oxygen air and was comfortable breathing room air by hospi-tal day 8. While cardiology preferred to observe she a while longer in the hospital for transient asymptomatic bradycardia， she wanted to go home and was discharged on hospital day8. At about 1 year after delivery， the child is healthy with no complications per patient via telephone discussion.\n\n【22】A 24-year-old pregnant woman at 35 weeks of gestation with prior history of preeclampsia during her first pregnancy pre-sented to the ED with 5 days of fever， worsening shortness of breath and dry cough. Her SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing was posi-tive on admission to the hospital and chest X-ray showed bi-lateral infiltrates consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. She was admitted with borderline intermittent hypoxemia and treated with dexamethasone 6 mg orally daily and remdesivir. Hypoxemia quickly worsened requiring supplemental oxygen at a rate of 10 L/min via oxymizer. Also， starting on hospital day one， IVIG 0.5 g/kg (adjusted body weight) was administered daily for 3 days， with methylprednisolone 40 mg lV one hour before each infusion. Given the rapid progression throughout the first hospital day， it was decided to proceed with emergent cesarean section and due to her tenuous respiratory status， she was electively intubated and received general anesthe-sia for this procedure. The procedure was without complica-tion and she was brought to the ICU afterwards for ventila-tor management. She remained intubated for 4 days， and was then successfully extubated and weaned to oxygen support via high flow nasal cannula. She continued on remdesivir for 5days， dexamethasone for 10 days， along with IIG 0.5 g/kg for3 days. She did quite well and made fairly rapid improvement， thereafter. She started pumping breastmilk and had excellent supply per obstetrician's chart note. Over the next week， her hypoxemia resolved and she was discharged home on hospi-tal day 11 breathing room air without any additional supple-mental oxygen. The child was healthy with no complications>1 year after admission per patient via telephone discussion.\n\n【23】Discussion\n\n【24】Guidance of COVID-19 therapy in pregnancy is extremely limit-ed， in large part because pregnant patients are excluded from practice-evolving large randomized clinical trials. This case se-ries is consistent with the historical safety and tolerability of IIG use in pregnancy. Furthermore， despite severe or critical COVID-19， all 4 mother and child cases had excellent outcomes， with hospitalizations shorter than their illness severity would have predicted. One case in particular (Case 1) showed a very dramatic clinical improvement upon IVIG initiation. Pregnancy confers a relative immunosuppressed state that poses a great-er risk for severe COVID-19 disease and poor maternal and fe-tal outcomes ， yet therapeutics have not been studied due to exclusion of pregnant patients from early COVID clinical tri-als. Previous studies utilizing IIG treatment for COVID-19 in-fections have given mixed results. Retrospective studies have largely been positive， yet prospective clinical trials have been mixed， with some favorable results  and a more recent study showing no benefit . However， considerable debatestill exists that some subgroups of COVID-19 patients may ben-efit from IIG that are diluted by broad clinical trials which lack granularity among the heterogeneity of patient characteristics and timing of IIG administration . One study suggests that COVID-19 patients that may be particularly poised for IIG benefit are those that are younger， with fewer comorbidities， and treated early . Our internal drug utilization and evalua-tion of IVIG (Privigen@) for the treatment of severe COVID-19 pa-tients has shown clinical and pharmacoeconomic benefit when promptly applied to such patients with rapidly deteriorating ox-ygenation . At our institution， we targeted age <70 years， no previous irreversible end-organ damage， no significant CO-morbidities (renal failure， heart failure， dementia， active cancer malignancies) or no active treatment for cancer. The initiation of IVIG was shown to be effective if initiated within 48 hours of worsening hypoxia where oxygen requirements rapidly es-calate to maintain oxygen saturation levels above 92%.\n\n【25】Pregnant patients are generally younger and have fewer co-morbidities than most patients with COVID-19， but can pres-ent with high illness severity and， perhaps due to their relative immunosuppressed state， can suffer significant morbidity and mortality than comparable patients in their age group . Intrauterine fetal demise may be mediated through placenti-sis， and may occureven in mild disease .\n\n【26】To our knowledge， there has been only one previous case published where IVIG was utilized in a pregnant patient with COVID-19. The child was delivered by C-section at 36 weeks and both mother and child survived . In this case series， we present the utilization of off-label IVIG (Privigen) in 4 preg-nant patients with severe COVID-19， 3 of which became criti-cally ill requiring mechanical ventilation. Despite very high ill-ness severity and degree of hypoxia， all patients had excellent outcomes without any adverse consequences for them or their infants and discharged from the hospital to home in 3 weeks or less， with an average length of stay of 15 days. This duration of hospitalization is shorter than anticipated for COVID-19 pa-tients with this degree of illness severity， particularly when they become mechanically ventilated. Once patients are admitted to the ICU， average length of stay in the ICU alone is over 12days . Two patients presented near term at 35 weeks and were delivered by cesarean section， one electively a few days after admission and one emergently within 24 hours of admis-sion without complication. The 2 cases with second trimester pregnancies were preserved and had normal spontaneous vag-inal deliveries at term at a later date. All 4 patients tolerated the IIG therapy without any adverse drug events (including headache)， without complications with the pregnancy or the COVID-19 disease state itself. All 4 patients reported having healthy children at the 1-year outcome mark. Remdesivir is of-fered to all patients at our institution with COVID-19 symptoms of 7 days or less. However， Case 3 declined remdesivir treatment.\n\n【27】The specific mechanism of how IIG offers benefit in COVID-19 is unknown but may be in part through mitigation of endovascular NET formation. NET-mediated vascular inflammation may drive morbidity and mortality in COVID-19， just as it has been docu-mented to do so in malaria  and Dengue fever . Therefore， therapies that target immunothrombosis may be useful in treat-ing respiratory failure and vascular complications in COVID-19.\n\n【28】We have performed early studies that are still in progress on host responses to IVIG that appear to demonstrate high levels of platelet and neutrophil degranulation markers in the blood of patients on mechanical ventilation with critical COVID-19. A reduction in platelet and neutrophil degranulation is seen following MIG treatment， which appears related to a positive therapeutic response in COVID-19. Interestingly， baseline in-creases in platelet degranulation have been previously ob-served during pregnancy， perhaps underlying the higher risk of COVID-19 in the pregnant patient population .\n\n【29】Conclusions\n\n【30】In summary， we illustrate here 4 cases where IVIG was safely administered to pregnant patients with severe COVID-19 and all had excellent clinical outcomes. While there is no way of knowing whether the outcomes of the patients would have been different if compared with a placebo， IVIG may be a safe treatment consideration in pregnant women with severe COVID-19.We hope that this case series will inspire large con-trolled trials to be conducted with pregnant patients， not just with COVID-19， but with other viral mediated acute respira-tory distress syndromes which this patient population histor-ically has been more vulnerable to， including influenza .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Although many cases of SID-SMA have been reported in the literature in recent years because of the increased use of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scanning， optimal management has not yet been firmly established.\n\n【1】Case Reports：\n\n【2】We report 2 cases of SID-SMA that were managed with stenting and angioplasty via transfemoral access. In case 1 a 54-year-old man presented with diffuse abdominal pain without Blumberg sign. Laboratory data were unremarkable.Abdominal CT scanning revealed SID-SMA and initial bowel ischemia. The angiogram revealed a dissected true lumen of SMA with a narrowing of the ileo-colic artery managed， respectively， with self-expand-able stent placement and angioplasty. In case 2， a 45-year-old man presented with severe abdominal cramp-ing and pain of 3 days'duration. Physical examination revealed abdominal tenderness with positive Blumberg sign. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis and increased lactate dehydrogenase. Abdominal CT scan revealed SID-SMA and initial bowel ischemia. After an MA angiogram， 2 self-expandable stents were placed and an angioplasty was performed. Although a postprocedural angiogram showed good patency of the SMA in both patients， the first patient had a recurrence of abdominal pain after 5 days with a new narrowing tract of the SMA and more inferiorly a dissection with aneurysm of a false lumen， detected on CT scan， treated respective-ly with stenting and coils. CT follow-up showed successful morphological results in both patients.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】In our experience， endovascular treatment of SID-SMA is safe and effective， including in cases of recurrence and postprocedural evolution.\n\n【5】Keywords： Case Reports ·Dissection·Endovascular Procedures · Mesenteric Artery， SuperiorSpontaneous isolated dissection of the superior mesenteric ar-tery (SID-SMA) is a rare condition complicated by difficulty in di-agnosis. We describe 2 patients who presented with SID-SMA on the same night in 2 different Emergency Departments and who underwent endovascular treatment (ET) in our Interventional Radiology Unit. Therapeutic options of SID-SMA include surgical treatment， medical treatment， and ET， although no consensus has been reached regarding the best treatment modality . Two patients affected by SID-SMA in one night represent not only 2 cases， but also an opportunity to review the literature.\n\n【6】Case Reports\n\n【7】Case 1\n\n【8】A 54-year-old White man， with a medical history of hyper-tension treated with oral medications， was admitted to the Emergency Department with a 2-day history of diffuse abdom-inal pain. The patient denied any fever， nausea， or vomiting and reported being a regular smoker. Physical examination re-vealed mild diffuse abdominal pain with deep palpation with-out obvious muscle guarding or rebound tenderness， tempera-ture of 36℃， respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min， blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg， and a regular pulse rate of 75 beats/min. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis (white blood cell \\[WBC\\] count， 16 000×103/pl) and increased lactate dehydrogenase(LDH， 825 UI/L). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan with intravenous bolus contrast injection demonstrated SID-SMA  associated with“paper-thin wall\" intestinal sign ， dilatation of bowel lumen， and mesenteric fat stranding， without pneumatosis. The patient was quick-ly transferred to our Interventional Radiology Unit， where an SMA angiogram confirmed SID-SMA with a narrowing of the ileo-colic artery . We started the procedure with the right common femoral access. The SMA was superselected with a 5-Fr catheter (Merit Medical) through an 8-Fr introducer sheath (Epsylar， Optimed). A 0.9-mm guide wire (Terumo， Tokyo， Japan) and 0.8-mm super stiff guide wire (Amplatz Super Stiff) were negotiated to pass through the dissected true lumen. A10x40-mm self-expandable stent (BARD E - LUMINEXX) was deployed across the dissection (just covering the proximal in-timal tear)； the ileo-colic artery angioplasty was subsequent-ly performed (ULTRAVERSE 6.0x40-mm BARD) . A postprocedural angiogram showed good patency of the SMA and ileo-colic artery . The patient had a rapid res-olution of abdominal pain and was treated with intravenous fluids， antibiotics (cefazolin 2 g daily) and anticoagulant/anti-platelet therapy (sodium enoxaparin 8000 Ul and clopidogrel75 mg daily). Although subsequent blood exams were nor-mal， the patient had a recurrence of abdominal pain after 5days and abdominal CT scan revealed a narrowing tract of the SMA distal to the previous employed stent and a dissection with aneurysm of false lumen more inferiorly . We then used 2 stents (10x60 mm and 10x40 mm， BARDE E-LUMINEXX) and 3 coils (MWCER 35-7-10 COOK) in the aneurys matic false lumen (stent-assisted embolization) . The patient was discharged 10 days after admission on antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel 75 mg daily). Abdominal CT scan follow-up after 2 months showed successful restoration of the SMA lumen with good patency of the ileo-colic artery .\n\n【9】Case 2\n\n【10】A 45-year-old White man was admitted to the Emergency Department with a 3-day history of severe abdominal cramp-ing and pain. He had no medical history and reported being a regular smoker Physical examination revealed a temperature of 37°C， respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min， blood pressure of 135/90 mmHg， and a regular pulse rate of 66 beats/min. Abdominal deep palpation demonstrated tenderness in the mesogastrium and in lower quadrants with positive Blumberg sign and the presence of abdominal distension with an inability to pass stool or gas. Laboratory tests showed neutrophilic leu-kocytosis (WBC 14 300×10 /pL) and increased LDH (700 UI/L). Radiography of the abdomen demonstrated poor representa-tion of intestinal meteorism and ultrasound was not diagnos-tic. Abdominal CT scan with intravenous bolus contrast injec-tion showed a contrast filling defect in the proximal SMA (3cm from the origin) that extended to a jejunal branch， an in-timal flap and thrombosis of the false lumen with true lumen compression， and initial sign of bowel ischemia in absence of pneumatosis. The patient was quickly transferred to our inter-ventional Radiology Unit where an SMA angiogram revealed a compressed true lumen and an intimal flap with a dissec-tion and segmental narrowing distal to it (true lumen com-pressed) . We started the procedure with right common femoral access. The SMA was superselected with a5-Fr Cobra catheter through a 7-Fr guiding sheath. A 0.9-mm J-tip guide wire (Terumo) was negotiated to pass the dissec-tion. We deployed 2 overlapping self-expandable stents (10x40mm BARD E - LUMINNEX) placed across the dissection (just covering the proximal intimal tear) and angioplasty. A post-procedural angiogram showed good patency of the SMA with no narrowing . The patient had a rapid resolution of abdominal pain during hospital course， with resumption of gastrointestinal function on the second day； he was treated with intravenous fluids， antibiotics (cefazolin 2 g daily)， and double antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 100 mg and clopidogrel75 mg daily). Postoperative blood tests were normal， and the patient was discharged home in good health 6 days after ET on antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel 75 mg daily). Two months later， CT scan follow-up showed successful restoration of the true lumen with good distal flow .\n\n【11】SID-SMA is an extremely rare condition， with a reported inci-dence of 0.06% in a series of 6666 autopsy cases . It occurs after a tear in the intima or primary hemorrhage in the me-dia (due to rupture of the vasa vasorum) with subsequent ac-cumulation of blood between the medial and the adventitial layers， and it can extend over a variable distance . After the carotid artery， the SMA is the second most common periph-eral artery to be affected by dissection . Since it was first reported by Bauersfeld  in 1947， there have been approx-imately 90 cases of SID-SMA in the literature， and 60 caseswere treated with ET from 2000 to 2011 . Diagnosis is dif-ficult due to nonspecific symptoms and signs. In recent years， the widespread use of high-quality contrast-enhanced CT scans has revealed an increased incidence of SID-SMA. The majori-ty of cases reported were found in men 39-82 years old， with a mean age of 54 years . The cause of SID-SMA is not ful-ly understood， and several risk factors have been postulated， such as pathologies of the arterial wall (fibromuscular dyspla-sia， cystic medial necrosis， adventitial inflammation)， congenital connective tissue disorders， genetic predisposition (heteroge-neity of chromosome locus 5q13-14)，trauma， abnormal hemo-dynamic forces caused by convex curvature and the runningof the SMA from a fixed to a relatively mobile area， hyper-tension， and cigarette smoking . Pathogenesis is based on shear-stress injury. The entry of the dissection is mostly lo-cated on the anterior wall (98.1%) and around the greater curve of the SMA curvature (ie， 1.5-3.0 cm from its origin) . Diagnosis is a challenge because clinical presentation rang-es from asymptomatic to acute peritonitis and it is correlated with stenosis of the true lumen and dissection length of the SMA. Abdominal pain is the most common symptom， and otheratypical accompanying symptoms are nausea， vomiting， ileus， bloody stool， diarrhea， and emaciation . Laboratory tests and abdominal radiography are usually unremarkable， but ul-trasound imaging is helpful in identifying the intimal flap and the entry or reentry points； CT angiogram and arteriography are the diagnostic modalities of choice. Optimal management has not been firmly established， and treatment approaches include conservative management (anticoagulation and blood pres-sure control)， percutaneous endovascular interventions (stentplacement， intralesional thrombolytic therapy， or embolother-apy)， and surgical interventions (artery ligation， endoaneurys-morraphy， aortomesenteric bypass， or laparotomic resection). The aim is to limit the extension of the dissection， to pre-vent the rupture of the false lumen， and to maintain the distal blood perfusion 12. The choice depends on clinical aspects， CT findings， and professional resources， such as whether an in-terventional radiologist is available. In asymptomatic patients with incidental findings or in symptomatic patients with no evidence of bowel infarction， bleeding， or aneurysmal chang-es， with good flow on the angiogram， conservative treatment may be the first choice. ET should be performed in the case of dissection progression， increasing size of the aneurysmal dil-atation of the SMA， luminal thrombosis， or persistent symp-toms despite anticoagulation. Emergency surgery is reserved for symptomatic patients in whom low blood flow with bowel necrosis or artery rupture is suspected . The indication for ET is disputed. Min et al  suggested severe compression ofthe true lumen (>80%) and aneurysmal dilatation >20 mm in diameter. Stent placement via the conventionally used femo-ral artery approach or via the radial artery approach pro-vides immediate symptom relief by obliterating the false lu-men and increasing blood flow into the small intestine and quickly prevents further progression of the SMA dissection. Because the dissection is consistently located around the cur-vature of the SMA， the stent must completely cover the curva-ture of the SMA and needs good flexibility and minimal short-ening and it must not change location due to the continuous movements of the mesentery. A self-expanding stent is rec-ommended because of its good radial strength， flexibility， con-formability， and sufficient length . Stenting technique has been the most commonly used approach in recent years， with a success rate of 86% . However， little is known about the risk of restenosis or obstruction of the stented segment， and studies with longer follow-up periods are needed . The ef-ficiency of stent placement is similar to surgical recanalizationof the SMA， and both treatments are better than conservative management with anticoagulation . In case of a dissecting SMA aneurysm， coiling of the aneurysmatic false lumen (to ex-clude the aneurysm from the blood flow) and stenting of the true lumen， as in case 1， represent a safe and effective alter-native treatment to surgery . Our experience (illustrated by case 1) demonstrates that postprocedural restenosis and an-eurysmatic dilatation are possible postprocedural evolutions， but even in this event， an ET is effective. Close follow-up and a tailored treatment are the keys for a successful management.\n\n【12】Conclusions\n\n【13】To date， no recommended guidelines exist for the treatment of SID-SMA and follow-up of asymptomatic patients， nor has the best therapeutic strategy been established in symptom-atic patients. Based on previous cases reports and our expe-rience reported here， SID-SMA can be successfully treated with ET. Stent placement represents the definitive treatment for symptomatic patients (without arterial rupture or intesti-nal necrosis) because it is rapid， safe， and effective， including in the event of postprocedural evolutions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Middle meningeal artery (MMA) embolization was first proposed as an adjuvant therapy to prevent recurrence after surgical evacuation of CSDH and subsequently as the primary treatment modality Disadvantages of MMA embolization include expensive procedural price， increased radiation exposure， and ad-ditional labor. MMA embolization also has the disadvantages of slow clinical response and prolonged time for radiographic clearance.\n\n【2】Case Report： A 98-year-old man presented with a symptomatic CSDH. A single pterional burr hole was placed over the origin of the calvarial portion of the MMA， thus allowing for the drainage of the CSDH and coagulation of the MMA. The procedure resulted in immediate cessation of symptoms， decrease of the hematoma size， disappearance of the hematoma at 4 weeks， and no recurrence.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】The location where the calvarial portion of the MMA leaves the outer sphenoid wing and enters the cranial vault can be reliably identified by means of external landmarks and confirmed by intraoperative fluoroscopy. Drainage of the CSDH and coagulation of the calvarial branch of the MMA can be achieved with a single pro-cedure performed under local/conscious sedation. This report has shown that in cases of CSDH in the elderly， imaging is important to determine the optimum approach to hematoma drainage， which， in this case， required a pterional burr hole combined with MMA coagulation. This case report demonstrates feasibility of a novel pro-cedure； further studies are needed to ascertain its usefulness.\n\n【5】Keywords： Blood Coagulation · Hematoma， Subdural， Chronic\n\n【6】Middle meningeal aitery (MMA) embolization (MMAE) has been proposed， first， as an adjuvant therapy to prevent recur-rence after surgical evacuation of a chronic subdural hema toma (CSDH)  and， subsequently， as the primary treat-ment modality .

This report presents the case of a 98-year-old man who underwent a single pterional burr hole coupled with MMA coagulation for unilateral CSDH.\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】A 98-year-old right-handed man described mild deterioration of gait over a period of 3 months. He experienced a sudden onset of vomiting while driving about 3 weeks prior to presen-tation. Since then， he had experienced intermittent right oc-cipital headaches and occasional nausea. Headache， nausea， and vomiting suggested raised intracranial pressure. The pa-tient had been taking 2 tablets of Advil by oral administration twice daily for headache relief for the 2 weeks prior to presen-tation. A week prior to admission， the patient slipped and fell at home. He had poor recollection of the details of the fall but did not believe that there had been any loss of consciousness.\n\n【9】Up to the onset of the presenting symptoms， the patient had been in excellent general health， living independently， caring for all his affairs， and driving. There were no comorbidities. His only medication had been prophylactic daily 81 mg of aspirin.\n\n【10】On examination at admission， the patient appeared in excel-lent general health for his age. There was no external sign of injury to the head. The recent fall had resulted in a scab over the left elbow. The patient’s body mass index was 22.1. blood pressure 123/74 mmHg， puise 85 beats per min， temperature36.5℃， and 02 saturation 97%.\n\n【11】The patient was oriented to person，time， and place and pre-sented appropriate behavior and affect. The examination of cranial nerves was normal except for mild chronic bilater-al hearing loss. There was minor difficulty with gait and im-balance upon turning. He was unable to tandem-walk. Motor and sensory systems were normal. The deep tendon reflexes were present and symmetrical in the upper and lower limbs.\n\n【12】Laboratory test results， including complete blood count with differential， coagulation profile， and basic metabolic profile， were all within normal range.\n\n【13】The preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan of the head demonstrated a 13-mm low-attenuation right subduralhematoma covering most of the convexity on this side，com-pressing the ipsilateral ventricle， and causing no midline shift. There was effacement of the right cortical sulci and changes suggestive of deep small-vessel ischemia .\n\n【14】The patient underwent an evacuation of the right subdural col-lection， under local sedation. He was placed supine on the op-erating table， with the ipsilateral shoulder raised over a foam roll. The head rested on a horseshoe headrest. The pterion-al burr hole was placed at the point where the MMA enters the calvarium at the tip of the greater sphenoid wing. There were 2 steps to identify this middle meningeal calvarial en-try point ：\n\n【15】1)The use of surface landmark measurements by identify-ing the point of intersection between a 3.5-cm line from the posterior edge of the superior portion of the zygomatic process of the frontal bone with a 5.5-cm line drawn from the external acoustic meatus (zygomatic-meatal angle). The surface measurements of the zygomatic-meatal angle were initially taken from human skulls， as a preliminary approx-imation. They helped to locate where the metallic marker was to be placed prior to fluoroscopy， therefore minimizing the amount of radiation exposure. However， because of in-dividual patient's variations， the location of the MMA need-ed to be confirmed by fluoroscopy during the procedure.\n\n【16】2) Confirmation of the site by intraoperative oblique later-al fluoroscopy of the skull with a metallic surface marker placed at the tip of the zygomatic-meatal angle： the great-er sphenoidal wing and the groove of the MMA and its cal-varial entry point can be clearly visualized on the fluoros-copy images. By slightly tilting the fluoroscopy beam， one can separate the contralateral equivalent features from the one identified by the metallic marker.\n\n【17】After suitable sterile preparation and draping of the surgi-cal field， the soft tissues were infiltrated with local anesthe-sia (half and half combination of 1% lidocaine and 0.25%marcaine)， and a 3.5-cm coronal incision was centered at the middle meningeal calvarial entry point. The temporalis mus-cle fascicles were retracted by blunt separation of its fibers， which were then held by a 2-prong Weitlander 4” self-retain-ing retractor. A small burr hole was fashioned using a match-stick drill bit， which allowed the visualization of the branches of the MMA bifurcation. The MMA， at the point of its calvari-al entry， was then bipolar coagulated and divided as the dura mater was opened.\n\n【18】The evacuation of the hematoma was conducted the standard way. The position of the table could be changed， as needed， to use gravity to assist the drainage of the most distal por-tions of the hematoma. A red rubber catheter was used to wash off the residual blood using normal saline solution. The entire procedure lasted 70 min (which included splitting offibers of the temporalis muscle)， and the estimated blood loss was less than 10 mL.\n\n【19】Apart from incisional pain， the patient had no postoperative concerns and was up by himself on the first postoperative day. He was discharged with home care on the second post-operative day. He had assistance with housework and gro-cery shopping for 2 weeks but took over the management of all his home and personal affairs after that. Family membersdescribed that the patient had returned to his “old self\". The neurological examination was normal at 5 weeks after surgery， except for persistence of mild bilateral hearing loss. The sur-gical incision was hardly visible.\n\n【20】Follow-up CT scans performed at 10 days and 4 weeks after surgery showed a satisfactory appearance， with progressive resolution of the right subdural collection. A third postopera-tive CT scan was performed at 6 months， as the patient hadanother fall. There was no longer any fluid collection in the right convexity subdural space .\n\n【21】Discussion\n\n【22】This case report describes the feasibility of a novel treatment for unilateral CSDH by combining the use of pterional burr hole， coupled with coagulation of the MMA.\n\n【23】There has been a marked increase in the incidence of CSDH in the elderly population during the last decades . This like-ly results from the increased average age of the population， age-related cerebral atrophy， frequency of falls in the elderly， and increased use of anticoagulants . This trend is likely to continue. Therefore， the search for less invasive and less ex-pensive options in the treatment of symptomatic CSDH is a worthwhile pursuit .\n\n【24】Surgical drainage of symptomatic CSDH has been historically the most popular treatment， despite presenting multiple chal-lenges . It is highly effective for the immediate relief of symptoms . However， neurosurgeons have disagreed on the best method for the surgical management of CSDH，varying a single burr hole with or without postoperative draining devices to multiple burr holes or extensive craniotomies .Despite the type of surgical procedure， recurrences requiring re-opera-tion have remained relatively high . In the procedure de-scribed in the present report， the MMA is coagulated under di-rect inspection and divided before the dura mater is opened： it should follow that the risk of postoperative hemorrhagic compli-cations should be less than that for routine burr hole evacuation.\n\n【25】Mandai et al in 2000  and Takahashi et al in 2002  were the first authors to report on the use of MMAE for the treat-ment for chronic subdural hematomas refractory to surgical drainage. Satisfactory results of MMAE for recurrent CSDH were later confirmed in 5 cases by Tempaku et al in 2015. There is disagreement in the literature related to the nomenclature of the branches of the MMA as it enters the calvarium . Therefore， we simply refer to it as calvarial MMA in this report.\n\n【26】More recently， the use of MMAE has been proposed as upfront treatment for CSDH， instead of surgical evacuation. Some ear-lier investigators reported a decrease in number of recurrences as compared with that of open surgery ， while more recent-ly authors report comparable results . There are presently several prospective studies on the subject . The main dis-advantage of the MMAE approach is the delay in clinical re-sponse  and decrease in size of the subdural collection. However， when used in conjunction with surgical evacu-ation， MMAE has been shown to decrease the rate of re-op-erations . Although several recent studies have explored the relative safety and efficacy of MMAE vs burr hole drain-age， none of those studies has reached level l scientific rigor. Indeed， there are several ongoing multi-center， prospective， randomized studies being conducted to address the role of efficacy of MMAE .\n\n【27】Therefore， it appears logical to combine the 2 interventions， namely  burr hole drainage of the subdural hematoma plus ligation of the MMA， into a single minimally invasive pro-cedure. Our clinical case demonstrates the feasibility of plac-ing a single pterional burr hole at the calvarial entry point of the MMA， allowing its bipolar coagulation together with thedrainage of the subdural collection under local sedation. For the rare instances when the subdural collection does not in-volve the middle meningeal calvarial entry point， the option of the placement of 2 burr holes is always there. Further po-tential advantages to this procedure include reduction in cost， decreased exposure to radiation， and shortening of follow-up.\n\n【28】Conclusions\n\n【29】The surgical modification described here shows the feasibil-ity of successfully treating CSDH hematomas by a minimally invasive surgical procedure and addresses  the immediate evacuation of the subdural collection and decrease in mass effect and  coagulation of the calvarial portion of the MMA. This report has shown that in cases of CSDH in the elderly， imaging is important to determine the optimum approach to hematoma drainage， which， in this case， required a pterion-al burr hole combined with MMA coagulation. This case re-port demonstrates its feasibility； however， the possible effica-cy of this procedure to reduce subdural recurrences requires further studies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The possibility of damage to the ureters may not be considered in the setting of acute trauma when life-threatening injuries take clinical management priority. A case of acute ureteral injury is described in a patient with acute penetrating gunshot abdominalin-jury that had a delay in diagnosis， with a review of the literature.\n\n【2】Case Report： A29-year-old woman presented to our hospital with a missed ureteral injury following a self-inflicted gun-shot injury to the abdomen. She underwent abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging and a retrograde pyelogram， which showed complete transection of the left upper ureter with contrast extravasation and the formation of a large urinoma. She underwent a percutaneous nephrostomy and drainage of the urinoma. An end-to-end ureteric anastomosis with excision of the intervening injured ureter， or ureteroureterostomy， was performed three weeks following the diagnosis.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】Ureteral injuries following trauma are rare， but a delay in diagnosis can be associated with clinical morbidity. A high index of clinical suspicion is important for early identification of ureteral injury in cases of acute abdom-inal trauma.\n\n【5】MeSH Keywords： Abdominal Injuries · Ureter· Wounds， Gunshot\n\n【6】The diagnosis of ureteral injury can be delayed in the setting of acute trauma， as life-threatening injuries take clinical man-agement priority. Also， trauma to the ureter is a rare occurrence in emergency cases， accounting for less than 1% of all cases of urologic trauma . The ureter is protected by its retroper-itoneal location and by the surrounding anatomy， especially by the psoas muscles and the bony pelvis . Most ureter-al injuries are iatrogenic and occur during open， laparoscopic， or ureteroscopic procedures， while less than 25% of ureteral injuries are due to other causes .\n\n【7】In the setting of trauma， penetrating injuries account for most cases of ureteral injury， and include gunshot wounds， with the ureter being injured in between 2-5% of abdominal gunshot injuries . However， due to the life-threatening injuries associ-ated with abdominal trauma， up to 38.2% of the ureteral inju-ries are reported to undergo a delay in diagnosis， which can re-sult in a significant rate of morbidity and even mortality .\n\n【8】A case of acute ureteral injury is described in a patient with acute penetrating gunshot abdominal injury that had a delay in diagnosis， with a review of the literature.\n\n【9】Case Report\n\n【10】A 29-year-old women presented to our hospital 6 weeks follow-ing a self-inflicted gunshot injury to the abdomen， with three wounds that involved the epigastrium，the left hypochondrium， and the left lumbar area. She underwent laparotomy at another hospital. Intra-operative findings showed perforation in the an-trum of the stomach antrum and multiple small bowel perfora-tions， which all underwent primary surgical repair. There were also bilateral lateral (zone 2) retroperitoneal hematomas， which were non-expanding and non-pulsatile， and were initially not explored.\n\n【11】The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU)， where she later developed a pulmonary embolism (PE) and dis-seminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She was managed with blood products and recovered over a period of one month and was discharged home in a stable condition.\n\n【12】The patient presented two weeks later to a local health center with left iliac fossa (LIF) pain， watery stool， a reduced hemo-globin level， and a raised serum C-reactive protein (CRP). She underwent an abdominal； computed tomography (CT) scan(contrast-enhanced)， which showed a large， left-sided， well-en-hanced retroperitoneal collection with contrast extravasation into the retroperitoneal space， with the appearance of con-trast in the left retroperitoneal space， indicating left ureteral injury with urinoma formation and colonic fistula.\n\n【13】The patient was referred to our trauma center and under-went cystoscopy with a retrograde pyelogram ， which showed complete transection of the left upper ureter with con-trast extravasation into the retroperitoneal space. She under-went left percutaneous nephrostomy， and a left-sided pigtail drain was inserted into the urinoma. The patient was treat-ed with antibiotics throughout her hospital admission as her sepsis workup investigations showed the presence of a multi-drug-resistant coliform. Clear urine was draining from the uri-noma during the patient’s hospital stay.\n\n【14】A repeat CT scan one week later showed a reduction in the size of the left-sided urinoma collection. However a further well-defined， peripherally enhancing collection in the right side of the pelvis was identified， compressing the urinary bladder. The patient underwent another pigtail drain in-sertion， which drained only minimal dark reddish fluid， result-ing in its removal after 48 hours. The patient was discharged in a stable condition and brought back to the hospital， three weeks later， for elective surgery.\n\n【15】Cystoscopy was done prior to the surgery， which was normal apart from extra-luminal compression of the bladder from the pelvic hematoma. Intraoperatively， a 2.5 cm segment of dense fibrosis was seen in the upper ureter at the site of complete ureteral transection . The ureter was mobilized and a left end-to-end ureteric anastomosis with excision of the intervening injured ureter， or ureteroureterostomy， was per-formed， after spatulation of the ends with a tension-free water-proof anastomosis over a double J stent (DJS). Colonoscopy wasdone intra-operatively with methylene blue instillation through the pigtail drain to check for any persistent fistula. However， methylene blue testing was negative suggesting spontaneous fistula healing. The patient was discharged from hospital on the third post-operative day， in good condition. She was seen in the outpatient department (OPD) two months later and un-derwent flexible cystoscopy with removal of the left DJS. The patient failed to show up for further follow-up.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Patients with ureteral injuries are usually asymptomatic， and the diagnosis can be difficult to make. However， the presence of hematuria should alert the clinician to a possibility of a ure-teral injury . Also， patients with penetrating injuries are usually hemodynamically abnormal at the time of presen-tation and require urgent surgical intervention， that may be without prior computed tomography (CT) scan or intravenouspyelography (IVP)， which are investigations that identify up to90% of ureteral injuries . Since ureteral injuries are infrequent and few surgeons have significant experience with their man-agement， a high index of suspicion is required during surgery.\n\n【18】Bageacu and colleagues divided the retroperitoneal abdomi-nal injuries into three zones that correspond to the major un-derlying structures that could be injured . The central zone(zone 1) extends from the hiatus of the esophagus to the sacral promontory； the lateral zone (zone 2) extends from the later-al diaphragm to the iliac crests； the pelvic zone (zone 3) con-tains the retroperitoneal space of the pelvis . The decision to perform surgical exploration in blunt injury depends on the zone， and whether the hematoma is expanding or pulsatile. However， this does not apply to penetrating injury， in which the trajectory of a sharp object can be identified. Therefore， all zones should be explored if involved . In unclear cases， ret-rograde or antegrade urography is the gold standard for con-firmation of the diagnosis .\n\n【19】In patients who are hemodynamically normal， the radiologi-cal diagnostic modalities of choice for ureteral injury are CT urography and IVP. However， MP is not usually used in the setting of trauma and is usually used as follow-up after sur-gical intervention . Although the sensitivity of IP ranges from between 60-90%， it is associated with high rate of false-negative diagnoses (33%)， as a demonstration of urinary ex-travasation is seen in less than 50% of patients . Findings that increase the suspicion of ureteral injury on CT urography or IP include delayed excretion of contrast， poor function on one side， hydronephrosis， failure to visualize the entire course of the ureter， and extravasation of the contrast material2.\n\n【20】With the availability of CT scanning and its sensitivity， contrast-enhanced CT has been the recent diagnostic modality of choice； it is recommended that a five-minute to eight-minute delay is included in the use of contrast-enhanced spiral CT after con-trast infusion， to increase the sensitivity . Approximately80% of injuries can be missed on initial CT and detected only on delayed CT imaging . In hemodynamically normal pa-tients or during surgery， a definitive diagnosis can be achieved by retrograde pyelography via cystoscopy， which is the most ac-curate method for establishing the diagnosis .AIso， Cys-toscopy allows for possible treatment intra-operatively with retrograde indwelling stent placement .\n\n【21】Ureteral injuries can be missed， or the diagnosis can be delayed， usually due to hemodynamic abnormalities or other distracting injuries or due to a low index of suspicion. Penetrating abdomi-nal injuries affecting the ureters are usually associated with oth-er injuries 90% of cases， and include injuries to the small bow-el (75%)， colon (40%)， and inferior vena cava (IVC) (20%) . These injuries can also change the management of the ureter-al injuries based on the hemodynamic status， the extent of in tra-abdominal organ injuries， and the amount of bleeding .\n\n【22】The most common location for ureteral injuries is at the vesi-co-ureteral junction and the upper part of the ureter . However， in case of delayed diagnosis of ureteral injuries， a re-view of the literature has shown that 59.5% of all the missed ureteral injuries involved the proximal ureter . There are no specific signs and symptoms of ureteral injuries， but some of the patients may present a few days following the injury with lower abdominal pain， prolonged ileus， low-grade fever， nausea， vomiting， persistent hematuria， urinary tract infec-tion (UTI)， oliguria， and anuria， with laboratory investigations showing leukocytosis and raised inflammatory markers . In some cases， a transient increase in serum creatinine levels can be found . If ureteral damage remains undiagnosed for up to 6-12 days， patients can develop urinary leakage in-tra-abdominally， urinary obstruction， urinomas， fistulas， and sepsis .\n\n【23】In a case of delayed diagnosis or missed diagnosis of ureter-al injuries， it is important to divert the urine， which can be achieved with either a retrograde stent placement or percu-taneous nephrostomy . Also， drainage of any urinoma or abscess that has formed should be done . Surgical repair of the ureters in such cases is deferred for 6-8 weeks to al-low any edema or inflammation to subside. However， there is no evidence to support that there is a worse outcome if the surgical repair is done immediately after identifying the inju-ry . Ureteral contusions are usually treated by stenting . Complete transections of the ureter can be repaired using a tension free， end-to-end， spatulated anastomosis over a ure-teral stent. As with all urologic injuries， initial debridement should be conservative in order to preserve all viable tissue. In cases ofinadequate ureteral length to re-anastomose， a pe-diatric feeding tube or other tubes may be placed in the prox-imal ureter and brought out through the skin for closed drain-age. Reconstruction of the ureter can then be performed later.\n\n【24】The surgical approach to ureteral repair can be classified ac-cording to the level of injury . Distal ureteral injuries can be repaired by performing a ureteroneocystostomy with or without performing a vesico-psoas hitch， with the former preferred in case of a lengthy ureteral defect， which would result in tension if anastomosed directly to the bladder. Ureteroneocystostomy can be performed using different sur-gical techniques and require stenting of the re-implanted ure-ter for at least 6 weeks . In performing the vesico-psoas hitch， the bladder is mobilized and hitched to the psoas mus-cle， followed by ureteral re-implantation .\n\n【25】Upper and mid-ureteral injuries can be surgically managed us-ing multiple methods. End-to-end ureteric anastomosis with excision of the intervening injured ureter， or ureteroureteros-tomy can be performed directly， and the anastomosis should be done over a stent. In cases where the distal part of the ure-ter is not suitable or available for anastomosis， a Boari tabu-larized bladder flap can be performed. The bladder is opened anteriorly， and a full thickness bladder flap is anastomosed to the proximal ureter. Other less common surgical procedures include transureteroureterostomy， renal autotransplantation， and ureteral substitution with the ileum or appendix . Ureteral pelvic junction (UPJ) avulsion injuries should under-go re-anastomosis of the ureter to the renal pelvis， in which case， a stent and drain need to be placed \n\n【26】The importance of early identification of ureteral injuries has been shown to be associated with better clinical outcomes . Early di-agnosis is considered to be the single most important prognos-tic factor . Patients with a delayed diagnosis of ureteral injury have been reported to develop complications in up to 40% of cas-es， compared with 10% of cases with immediate diagnosis . These complications， associated with diagnostic delay， includeinfected urinoma formation， hydronephrosis， ureteral fistulae， ureteral strictures， prolonged hospitalization， multiple invasive procedures， acute renal failure， and patient mortality .\n\n【27】Conclusions\n\n【28】Ureteral injuries following trauma are rare， but a delay in diagno-sis can be associated with clinical morbidity. Patients with ure-teral injuries can present with non-specific symptoms includ-ing abdominal pain， fever， nausea and vomiting， hematuria，andurinary tract infections. The most sensitive radiological diagnos-tic test for ureteral injury is retrograde pyelography via cystos-copy， which can show contrast extravasation. An abdominal CT scan can identify the presence of urinoma or an intra-abdominal collection. In unclear cases， retrograde urography can be used as a confirmatory test. A high index of suspicion， for ureteral injury is warranted for patients with penetrating abdominal trauma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

This report is of a 37-year-old woman presenting at 39 weeks of pregnancy with acute thoracic aortic dissection due to previously undiagnosed FBN1-related Marfan syndrome. This case report aims to illustrate the challenges in the diagnosis and in the peri-operative management of acute aortic dissection during pregnancy A healthy 37-year-old woman at 39 weeks of gestation presented to our hospital with dyspnea and chest pain. Initial evaluation for pulmonary embolism with chest computed tomography was unrevealing. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for further management. Overnight， her clinical conditions deteriorated， and a transthoracic echocardiography was obtained， demonstrating an acute ascending aortic dissection. She emergently underwent a successful combined cesarean section and ascending aortic dissection repair， with no immediate complications. On postoperative day 4 she developed cardiac tamponade， for which she under-went emergent mediastinal exploration. She was discharged home on postoperative day 10. A month later she completed genetic testing， which revealed a pathogenic mutation in the FBN1 gene， consistent with a molec-ular diagnosis of Marfan syndrome.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】This report has shown that FBN1-related Marfan’s syndrome has a variable clinical presentation that can in-clude life-threatening aortic dissection during pregnancy. Successful diagnosis and management of these pa-tients is challenging and requires multidisciplinary expertise， including confirmation of the diagnosis by a clin-ical geneticist.\n\n【5】Keywords：\n\n【6】Anesthesia， Obstetrical· Aneurysm， Dissecting· Marfan Syndrome · Pregnancy Complications， CardiovascularAortic dissection in pregnancy is extremely rare and has been reported in only 0.0004% of all pregnancies ， accounting for 0.1-0.4% of all aortic dissections， but with a high mortali-ty rate for mother and fetus . Risks factors associated with aortic dissection include hypertension， collagen disorders such as Marfan syndrome， Ehlers-Danlos syndrome， bicuspid aor-tic valve， and Turner syndrome； inflammatory diseases lead-ing to vasculitis such as giant cell arteritis， Takayasu arteritis， rheumatoid arthritis； and a family history of aortic dissection and preexisting aortic aneurism . Pregnancy per se is a risk factor of aortic dissection， likely secondary to the phys-iologic hemodynamic changes that lead to increased circu-latory volume and elevated systemic blood pressure， and to the hormonal alterations that cause structural changes in the aorta . Pregnant women with underlying aortopa-thies such as Marfan syndrome are more susceptible to preg-nancy-related aortic dissection . In fact， in the National Registry of Genetically Triggered Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms and Cardiovascular Conditions (GenTAC) registry ， preg-nant patients with Marfan syndrome had an 8-fold increased risk of aortic dissection compared with non-pregnant Marfan patients . In high-risk women， multidisciplinary preconcep-tion counseling is advisable ； however， many women at high risk of aortic dissection are not recognized early . This report is of a 37-year-old woman presenting at 39 weeks ofpregnancy with acute ascending aortic dissection due to un-recognized FBN1-related Marfan syndrome.\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】A previously healthy， 37-year-old， G1P0 woman， 39 weeks pregnant， and without apparent complications or remarkable family history， presented to the emergency department of our community hospital with severe exertional chest and back pain associated with shortness of breath. Initial vital signs showed a blood pressure of 111/71 mmHg， pulse 85 beats per minute， oxygen saturation 100% on room air， and body temperature of 36.4℃. The initial physical examination showed a comfort-able gravid woman. No cardiac murmur or skeletal abnormali-ties were appreciated. Shortly thereafter she developed hypox-emia with an oxygen saturation of 80% on room air. Pulmonary embolism (PE) was suspected， and the patient underwent an emergent chest computed tomographic (CT) scan with intra-venous contrast， timed to evaluate the pulmonary arteries(CTPA)， which showed no pulmonary embolism but did reveal a possible differential density within the aortic arch and de-scending aorta  of unclear significance.\n\n【9】She was then admitted to the intensive care unit for further monitoring. Her symptoms worsened overnight， and a transtho-racic echocardiogram (TTE) was obtained， demonstrating acuteascending aortic dissection involving the aortic root and proximal ascending aorta (diameter of 58 mm at the sinus of Valsalva). At that time， fetal heart tone monitoring showed fetal heart rate deceleration for 60 seconds. Consultation from cardiology， cardiothoracic surgery， anesthesiology， critical care， and obstetrics was obtained and the decision was made to take the patient emergently to the operating room without further imaging， for combined cesarean section and ascending aortic dissection repair. A cryopreserved blood sample was also ob-tained， as blood transfusion was anticipated.\n\n【10】In the operating room， a left-sided radial arterial line was placed under local anesthesia and rapid sequence-general anesthesia was induced with 40 mcg of remifentanil， 150 mg of propofol， and 100 mg of succinylcholine. The patient was intubated Suc-cessfully， and a pulmonary artery catheter was placed. Generalanesthesia was then maintained with remifentanil infusion at1 mcg/kg/min， 2% sevoflurane， and rocuronium. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) confirmed a type A aor-tic dissection associated with severe aortic regurgitation， mild mitral regurgitation， and an ejection fraction of 55% . Cesarean section was performed via low transverse incision， with delivery of a single male infant. Initial Apgar scores were 8 and 9at 1 and 5 min， respectively. After adequate uterine hemostasis was achieved， the patient was fully heparinized and cardiopul-monary bypass was instituted through aortic arterial cannulation and 2-stage venous cannulation in the right atrium and supe-rior vena cava. Circulatory arrest was initiated with a tempera-ture of 18℃ and a flat electroencephalogram (EEG). Retrograde cerebral perfusion was performed via superior vena cava cannu-la and monitored with cerebral oximetry. On direct inspection of the heart， aortic dissection appeared to extend to the right cor-onary artery with associated periarterial hematoma. The patient underwent repair of the ascending aortic dissection with partial arch replacement， reimplantation of the innominate artery， re-suspension of the aortic valve with root augmentation， and sin-gle-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting with a saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery . Her total cardiac by-pass time was 6 h 33 min. Her circulatory arrest time was 54 min. She was progressively rewarmed and weaned from cardiopulmo-nary bypass using a low dose of epinephrine (0.02 mcg/kg/min).\n\n【11】The patient was extubated on postoperative day 1. On postop-erative day 4， she developed cardiac tamponade from myocar-dial bleeding after removal of temporary pacing wires， for which she underwent emergent mediastinal exploration and control of the bleeding with 7-0 Prolene suture. Her remaining postoper-ative course was uneventful， and she was started on labetalol for blood pressure reduction. Both patient and infant were dis-charged from the hospital on postoperative day 10. One month after being discharged， the patient was seen by a genetic coun-selor. She underwent genetic testing with a 35-gene comprehen-sive aortopathy panel， which showed a heterozygous mutationin the FBN1 gene (c.247+1G>A)， consistent with a molecular di-agnosis of FBN 1-related Marfan syndrome， which， together with her history， led to a final diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. Genetic testing was also performed on the patient’s child， who was found to carry the same FBN1 mutation. In the 12 months since pre-sentation， the patient has been followed closely in our multispe-cialty vascular center. She has tolerated labetalol well and has long-term contraception in place. Serial CT imaging has demon-strated a stable dissection of the aorta beginning at the level of the left subclavian artery and extending to the descending tho-racic and abdominal aorta and to both common iliac arteries. with a maximum diameter of 4.3 cm at the level of the proximal descending thoracic aorta . Her child has also been fol-lowed routinely since birth and he appears to be in good health.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】This report demonstrates that FBN1-related Marfan syndrome can present with life-threatening aortic dissection during preg-nancy， and a successful outcome requires multidisciplinary expertise. Aortic dissection in pregnancy is a rare but life-threatening event associated with significant maternal-fetal morbidity and mortality . Prior cases of aortic dissection in pregnancy have reported a mean age of 32+5 years， similar toour patient， and across all gestational ages . Usually， if the dissection occurs after 30 weeks of gestation， like in our case， a“single-stage delivery and aortic repair\" is preferred， as pre-viously described in 30% of cases， with an 83% maternal sur-vival rate and 67% fetal survival rate J.\n\n【14】Marfan syndrome is a well-known risk factor for aortic dis section . Maifan syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a mutation in FBN1 gene which encodes fibrillin 1， a component of microfibrils located mainly in the media . FBN1 gene mutation predisposes to the develop-ment of aortic aneurysms and dissections as well as skeletal and ocular features . FBN1-related Marfan syndrome has a broad spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from mild disease involving 1 or 2 organs to a multisystemic organ syn-drome . Most cases of aortic dissections in pregnant pa-tients with Marfan syndrome occur during the third trimester and are commonly due to type A dissection ， although cases of type B dissections have been described ， as well as cases in the post-partum period .\n\n【15】Patients with Marfan syndrome should be counseled about the possible maternal and fetal risks associated with preg-nancy ， and if pregnancy is desired， prophylactic aortic re-pair is suggested for those with aortic root diameter exceed-ing 40-45 mm according to the most recent American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology and European Society of Cardiology guidelines . During pregnan-cy， close follow-up with serial echocardiograms and consulta-tion with cardiovascular specialists are crucial for a succeSS-ful and safe pregnancy， as has been reported in a recent study by Narula et al . Medical optimization involves strict blood pressure control， and the use of beta blockers can help further reduce the risk of aortic dissection .Recognizing high-risk patients with Marfan syndrome is ideal， but is not always feasible. In fact， some patients do not exhibit all characteris-tic signs or symptoms of the condition， and some Marfan syn-drome-causing mutations can be de novo， resulting in a neg-ative family history ， which further reduces the ability to identify at-risk patients， as in our patient.\n\n【16】Although it is a rare event， clinicians should have high index of suspicion for aortic dissection in pregnant patients present-ing with chest or back pain， and potentially life-saving imaging should not be withheld， despite the risks of radiation.Multiple investigations have shown that modern protocols deliver high sensitivity and extremely low fetal radiation doses for PE de-tection in both ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scans and CTPA . This has resulted in the gradual shift toward first-line use of CTPA . However， the contrast bolus timed for the pulmo-nary arterial system， is often inadequate for evaluation of the aorta and systemic arterial vasculature. This timing is even more variable in pregnancy due to the altered blood volumeand cardiac output . In non-pregnant patients， a triple-rule-out CT scan can be considered to simultaneously evalu-ate the pulmonary， coronary， and systemic arterial vessels； however， the radiation dose is nearly 10 times greater than a standard CTPA； therefore， this technique is generally avoided in pregnant patients . In hemodynamically unstable pa-tients， TEE can be utilized， with a sensitivity of up to 98% and a specificity of 60-96%. Less favorable is TTE， which can help identifying the possible complications associated with the dissection (such as aortic valve integrity/regurgitation， hemo-pericardium)， but it cannot adequately and fully visualize the entire aorta， particularly the distal ascending， the transverse arch， and the proximal descending aorta . In our case， TTE was able to identify the dissection， which was confirmed with an intraoperative TEE study. Although there was some delay in the diagnosis of acute aortic dissection， our case outcome was favorable due to a prompt multidisciplinary approach in-volving specialists from obstetrics， cardiology， anesthesiolo-gy， neonatology， and cardiovascular surgery. To the best of our knowledge， this is the first successful case of acute aortic dissection in pregnancy reported from a community hospital.\n\n【17】Conclusions\n\n【18】Aortic dissection during pregnancy is a rare but potentially life-threating event. This report has shown that FBN1-related Marfan syndrome has a variable clinical presentation that can include life-threatening aortic dissection during pregnancy. Clinicians must maintain a high level of suspicion in pregnant patients with chest and back pain and continue to pursue ap-propriate imaging for potentially life-threatening conditions， even when initial testing is unrevealing. Successful emergent care of the pregnant patient with aortic dissection requires close multispecialty collaboration， including confirmation of the diagnosis by a clinical geneticist.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

We did not find published reports of buprenorphine--induced delirium in opioid users and now describe a patient who developed delirium probably due tobuprenorphine treatment.\n\n【1】Case report： The following report describes a case in which a physically healthy patient suffering from opioidabuse developed delirium under buprenorphine therapy. The patient was confused， had visual and verbal hallucinations， delusions of reference， influence and persecution， which were successfully treated by termination ofbuprenorphine and treatment with haloperidol.\n\n【2】Conclusions： The intention of this report is to draw new attention to the adverse event， which may represent adangerous side effect of treatment with a relatively novel medication. Some speculations about possible mecha-nisms and clinical implication are discussed. Further systematic study would be required， ifa significant number of cases.\n\n【3】BACKGROUND\n\n【4】Buprenorphine， a mixed agonist-antagonist opioid，is a potent analgesic that appears to be effective for the maintenance treatment of opiate abuse. Bupre-norphine is a semisynthetic derivative of thebaine， which is one of the naturally occurring phenanthrene alkaloids derived from the poppy plant contained in opium. Buprenorphine is a high-affinity partial ago-nist at the u-receptor and also acts as a potent K-antagonist. This partial u-receptor agonist is now available as an analgesic. It has been proposed as an alternative to methadone in the treatment of heroin addiction， both for detoxification and for mainte-nance . Its use has also been explored in the treat-ment of concurrent cocaine and opioid dependence， treatment-refractory unipolar nonpsychotic major depression ， and schizophrenia . In non-psychiatric practice buprenorphine use has been reported as an analgesic medication .\n\n【5】Safety and side effects of buprenorphine were studied clinically. It was found that the most frequent side effect was sedation， which occurred in approximately two-thirds of the patients. Other less frequent effects， in decreasing order， were： nausea， dizziness/vertigo，sweating， hypotension， vomiting， miosis， headache， vomiting and hypoventilation. Less than 1% of the patients noted CNS side effects： confusion， blurred vision， euphoria， weakness/fatigue， dry mouth， ner-vousness， depression， slurred speech and paresthesia. It was noted that buprenorphine had morphine like dose-related respiratory depressant effects. Although buprenorphine may also produce respirato-ry depression， the risk of overdose appears to be lower with buprenorphine than with either methadone or methadyl acetate . Deaths have been reported in association with overdose on buprenorphine in combi-nation with benzodiazepines \n\n【6】Curiously enough， the cases which described halluci-nations as a side effect of buprenorphine therapy， were associated with non psychiatric， anesthetic practice， after single doses of buprenorphine. Those cases resolved shortly after buprenorphine discontin-uation .\n\n【7】The following report describes a case in which a physically healthy patient suffering from opioid abuse developed delirium under buprenorphine therapy. The disorder was successfully treated with haloperidol.\n\n【8】CASE REPORT\n\n【9】Mr. B， a 44-year-old man was born in Israel. He was the last of six children in a family of North African origin. Early development was normal. After 8 years of schooling he started to work sporadically and to use drugs. He started with cannabinoids， then abused alcohol for a short period， and later turned to opi-oids. In the last few years he has used only heroin， up to 10 doses a day by his own report (each street bag contains approximately 60 to 80 mg of pure heroin， so the reported amount seems unusually high). He did not report general physical or neurological health problems. B. tried to stop using drugs at least twice before， including having enrolled in a metha-done program， but did not succeed. It's important to note that for a long period， B. bought drugs from the same narcotic dealer， and didn't mix different types of drugs. Finally， B. started Buprenorphine treat-ment in an outpatient clinic for the treatment of addictions， and received a dosage of 14mg/day. About a week after starting this treatment his mental status changed gradually， he became inpatient， anx-ious， his sleep became disrupted. His wife reported Dre that B. was taking the medication as prescribed， without missing doses or overdosing. During the next three days he became increasingly excited and even aggressive towards family members. He started with visual and auditory hallucinations， and was severely disoriented as for place， time and situation. In this condition， he was brought by his wife to a psychiatric facility， and was admitted in the dual-diagnosis unit.\n\n【10】On admission\n\n【11】B. was disoriented as for place and time， restless， tense， not cooperative， agitated and confused. His mood was unstable， irritable， and incongruent with the situation. He presented thought process distur-bances such as blocking and associative thinking. B felt that he was under the influence of strangers who had power on him and transmitted him telepathic messages. B. said that he heard voices’ that either compelled him to a certain course of action or com-mented on his behavior. He also saw the persons who were producing the voices he heard.\n\n【12】Physical examination， laboratory and neurological testing， were normal. Urinary drug test was negative.\n\n【13】The patient received haloperidol -5 mg/day， and Buprenorphine treatment was terminated.\n\n【14】After two days， his condition improved. He became oriented， his behavior stabilized， and he was able to communicate with those around him. Over the three following days， his condition gradually improved， and symptoms vanished completely. After a short period of treatment at the day clinic， he was discharged with the diagnosis of Delirium due to Buprenorphine therapy.\n\n【15】DISCUSSION\n\n【16】Buprenorphine produces morphine-like effects at low doses， but even when the dose is increased， the intensity of its actions does not seem to exceed that achieved by 30 to 60 mg of morphine. When bupre norphine is administerd sublingually， morphinelike subjective effects appear to reach a ceiling at about 8to 12 mg， with only modest increases in effect at 16and 32 mg. Over this dosage range， significant respi-ratory depression has not been observed. Because of this apparent ceiling， the risk of overdose may be limited. After repeated administration， buprenor-phine attenuates or blocks the subjective effects of parenterally administered morphine or heroin. Abrupt discontinuation of 8 mg sublingual buprenor phine after several weeks of continued administra-tion causes a generally mild opioid withdrawal syn-drome. The slow rate of dissociation of buprenor-phine from the j-receptor may account for its pro longed duration of action .\n\n【17】The intention of this report is to draw new attention to the adverse event， which may represent a danger-ous side effect of treatment with a relatively novel medication.\n\n【18】We did not find published reports of buprenorphine-induced delirium in opioid users.\n\n【19】Obviously， it is rather difficult to elicit one clear explanation and the origin of clinical phenomena， especially with substance abuse patients. The diffi-culties are mostly due to the combined use and abuse of different substances， use of substances pharmaco-logically dirty， low reliability of reports， and the fear of legal problems on the side of the reporter. In our case， we had collateral information that could verify the patient’s report.\n\n【20】Our case could provide evidence of a possible excita-tory or desinhibitory effect of buprenorphine on the limbic and extrapyramidal systems， which have a role in opiate induced behavior and mood changes.\n\n【21】Whether this is caused by a direct effect on specific opiate receptors which then stimulate other arousal pathways， or whether buprenorphine causes an increase in p-endorphin concentration in the corpus striatum， or whether other factors play other roles must be elucidated. Buprenorphine may alter other receptor systems that might cause delirium， like cholinergic or serotonergic pathways. These possible mechanisms should be studied further.\n\n【22】Although the dosage of buprenorphine Mr. B. received was theraputical， we should also take into consideration intoxication delirium. Intoxications due to regular dosage of medication occurs mostly when there is preexisting brain damage， which could be the result of a long period of drug abuse.\n\n【23】Another possible explanation for the delirium could be a neurotoxic effect of buprenorphine. Like other opioids such as meperidine， buprenorphine has toxic metabolites likeeN-dealkyl buprenorphineand buprenorphine-3-O-glucuronide that could accumu-late， causing delirium . The gradual progres-sion of symptoms described by the patient support this possible explanation.\n\n【24】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【25】Buprenorphine produces morphine-like effects at low doses， but even when the dose is increased， the intensity of its actions does not seem to exceed that achieved by 30 to 60 mg of morphine. When buprenorphine is administerd sublingually， mor-phinelike subjective effects appear to reach a ceiling at about 8 to 12 mg， with only modest increases in effect at 16 and 32 mg. Over this dosage range， sig-nificant respiratory depression has not been observed. Because of this apparent ceiling， the risk of overdose may be limited. After repeated adminis-tration， buprenorphine attenuates or blocks the sub-jective effects of parenterally administered morphine or heroin. Abrupt discontinuation of 8 mg sublingual buprenorphine after several weeks of continued administration causes a generally mild opioid with-drawal syndrome. The slow rate of dissociation of buprenorphine from the u-receptor may account for its prolonged duration of action \n\n【26】We did not find published reports of buprenorphine--induced delirium in opioid users.\n\n【27】Obviously， it is rather difficult to elicit one clear explanation and the origin of clinical phenomena， especially with substance abuse patients. The diffi-culties are mostly due to the combined use and abuseof different substances， use of substances pharmaco-logically ‘dirty， low reliability of reports， and the fear of legal problems on the side of the reporter.

Whether this is caused by a direct effect on specific opiate receptors which then stimulate other arousal pathways， or whether buprenorphine causes an increase in β endorphin concentration in the corpus striatum， or whether other factors play other roles must be elucidated. Buprenorphine may alter other receptor systems that might cause delirium， like cholinergic or serotonergic pathways. These possible mechanisms should be studied further.\n\n【29】Although the dosage of buprenorphine Mr. B. received was theraputical， we should also take into consideration intoxication delirium.

We discussed as possible explana tions neurotoxic effect of buprenorphine， intoxica tion delirium， excitatory or desinhibitory effect of buprenorphine on the limbic and extrapyramidal sys tems，\n\n【32】Systematic study would be required， if a significant number of cases were reported.\n\n| REFERENCES：  |\n| --- |\n\n【34】1\\.

In light of its associ-ation with diminished postoperative outcomes， recent efforts involve implementing preventive strategies and fostering early detection. This report highlights how multidisciplinary interventions can inform risk for delirium and the challenges that accompany identifying at-risk patients.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 75-year-old male with a history of postoperative cognitive complications including delirium and mild cog nitive impairment. He was attending an outpatient preoperative anesthesia clearance assessment prior to a planned removal for a left frontoethmoidal sinus mucocele. As part of clinical care， an in-house neuropsychol-ogist completed a neurobehavioral exam to assess current cognitive status and guide perioperative cognitive care recommendations. Findings were consistent with mild neurocognitive disorder.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】Given the patient’s history and current status， he was listed as a high delirium risk. The team provided infor-mation on delirium and delirium risk factors， encouraged the patient to speak to his surgeon and also a geri-atric specialist to assist with decision making. Due to their concern about delirium， the patient and his care-giver opted to postpone the left frontoethmoidal sinus mucocele removal.\n\n【6】MeSH Keywords： Cognition Disorders·Delirium· Patient-Centered Care\n\n【7】The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders， fifth edition (DSM-5) defines delirium as a disturbance in at-tention and awareness that develops over a short period，rep resents an acute change from baseline，fluctuates throughout the course of a day， and can involve disturbances in other cog-nitive domains that is distinct from neurocognitive disorders . Delirium risk factors include advancing age， pre-existing central nervous system vulnerabilities (low general cognition)， frailty， past history of delirium， immobilization， recent surgeries， his-tory of bone fractures， infections，hypoalbuminemia， abnormal sodium， dehydration， excess volume resuscitation， severe illness， alcohol use， polypharmacy， and depression . Despite being a common postoperative phenomenon， delirium remains mostly unrecognized， partly as a result of limitations in a cli-nician's ability to discern “acute changes\" in mental status from a patient's baseline characteristics . Delirium associ-ates with prolonged recovery， hospital readmission， future in-stitutionalization， and increased mortality .\n\n【8】The American College of Surgeons and the American Geriatric Society recommend routine assessment of delirium risk fac-tors in older patients considering surgery . In the preoper-ative context， prompt identification of cognitive and medical vulnerabilities should assist with identifying factors contrib-uting to reversible dementia (e.g.， polypharmacy， anticholin-ergic use， vitamin B deficiency， and frailty) .Importantly， information on cognitive status can guide pre-and post-op-erative cognitive care recommendations to the perioperative care team， geriatricians， and primary care physicians. Specific to delirium， a neurobehavioral examination also provides base-line data for quantifying pre-to post-operative behavioral and cognitive changes. Early recognition of cognitive impairment should also guide intraoperative and postoperative monitoring to mitigate delirium-related morbidities.\n\n【9】For this report， we present a patient seen within the context of a multidisciplinary presurgical anesthesia clinical setting. The case report expands on existing literature by highlighting how multidisciplinary assessment with neuropsychology is achiev-able within the outpatient setting and can provide physicians and patients with resources necessary to make informed med-ical decisions. It also illustrates professional challenges asso-ciated with identifying a patient at increased risk for delirium. Written patient consent was obtained for this publication be-fore submission.\n\n【10】Case Report\n\n【11】Mr. M， a 75-year-old， right-handed， Caucasian， male had a history of left frontoethmoidal sinus mucocele and worseningvisual disturbances. He was scheduled for a preoperative workup to assess his risk for major adverse perioperative events. Medical history includes coronary artery disease， dia-betes mellitus， hypertension， chronic obstructive puimonary disease， familial chondrocalcinosis， chronic pain， sleep apnea treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with intermittent use， renal insufficiency， cognitive dysfunction， and major depression. Mr. M and his caregiver reported prolonged aggression and combativeness following 3 prior surgeries from1996，1999， and 2004. An additional episode of postoperative altered mental state occurred in 2009 after emerging from se-dation for a bronchoscopy. All episodes resulted in hospital admissions lasting from one to three weeks. The most recent hospitalization in 2016 prompted a postoperative outpatient neuropsychology evaluation， which showed signs of (non-am-nestic) mild cognitive impairment. Medications at time of evalu-ation included aspirin (325 mg)， amlodipine (5 mg)， atorvastatin(40 mg)， labetalol (100 mg)， furosemide (40 mg)， montelukast(10 mg)， darifenacin (7.5 mg)， dutasteride (0.5 mg)， ropinirole(4 mg)， modafinil (100 mg)， oxycodone (40 mg)， hydrocodone(10-25 mg)， trazadone (40 mg)， diazepam (5 mg)， and sertra-line (50 mg). His anticholinergic load  showed high risk for anticholinergic toxicity. A comprehensive metabolic panel was notable for abnormally high urea nitrogen (24 mg/dL) and glu-cose (112 mg/dL) levels. Sodium， potassium， chloride， carbon dioxide， creatinine， BUN/creatinine ratio， calcium， albumin， total protein， albumin/globulin ratio， total bilirubin， and al-kaline phosphate levels were within expected ranges. Family history was positive for a complicated reaction to anesthesia(mother) not associated with malignant hyperthermia.\n\n【12】As part of the preoperative interview with the anesthesia staff member， Mr. M completed a routine frailty-cognitive screener， which included a frailty test ， clock drawing test ， and a 3-word memory task . This assessment showed frailty and Mr. M ambulated using an electric wheelchair， reported low physical activity， and described feeling tired most of them time. Staff cognitive screening suggested executive dysfunction. Mr. M's medical history combined with his current cognitive screening performance prompted a consult with the in-house neuropsychology team for a more extensive patient and care-giver interview and a neurobehavioral examination. The goal of this examination was to rule out the presence of a major neurocognitive disorder， gaining insight into his current cog-nitive strengths/weaknesses， help assess risk for delirium， and provide input on perioperative cognitive care considerations for his anesthesia， surgery， and his primary care providers. Table 1 shows neurobehavioral exam domains and measures.\n\n【13】Consistent with the initial screener， the neurobehavioral exam revealed further evidence of executive dysfunction including social disinhibition， non-linear discourse， diminished frustra-tion tolerance， and behavioral impulsivity. With respect to theprevious testing， Mr. M exhibited significant reductions in mea-sures of attention， mental manipulation， and initiation. Auditory comprehension， learning， memory， and orientation were within the average range. He continued to maintain functional inde-pendence (i.e.， managing his finances and dispense his medica-tions)， but reported increased reliance on compensatory strat-egies (e.g.， writing notes) and caregivers to complete tasks. Behaviorally， his caregiver described him as increasingly irri-table and apathetic. Active medication consumption， as well as endocrine， renal， respiratory， and cardiac functioning were considered during case conceptualization. Based on his age， history of delirium， medical status， and cognitive profile， a li-censed neuropsychologist assigned a diagnosis of mild neuro-cognitive disorder using DSM-5 criteria. Mr. M's history of vascular， respiratory， and renal insufficiencies， as well as cur-rent consumption of anticholinergic medications， influence his cognitive functioning. He was listed as high risk for postoper-ative cognitive complications.\n\n| Domain  | Instrument  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Patient and Caregiver Interviews  | Completed by Neuropsychologist  |\n| Premorbid Functioning/Reading Abilities  | Wide Range Achievement Test-Reading Subtest  |\n|  | Barona Demographic Estimate of Premorbid IQ  |\n| Global Cognitive Functioning  | Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE Clock Drawing to Command and Copy (from screening)  |\n| Attention  | Wechsler Adult Intelligence Test， 3rd edition (WAIS-III) Digit Span (WAIS-III) Forward  |\n|  | Span  |\n| Working Memory/Inhibitory Functioning  | Boston Revision Mental Control Subtest- Months Forward WAIS-III Digit Span Backward Span Letter Fluency (Letter F) Boston Revision Mental Control Subtest- Months BackwardsMMSE sub-item： WORLD spelled backwards  |\n| Working Memory/Inhibitory Functioning  | Boston Revision Mental Control Subtest- Months Forward WAIS-III Digit Span Backward Span Letter Fluency (Letter F) Boston Revision Mental Control Subtest- Months BackwardsMMSE sub-item： WORLD spelled backwards  |\n| Working Memory/Inhibitory Functioning  | Boston Revision Mental Control Subtest- Months Forward WAIS-III Digit Span Backward Span Letter Fluency (Letter F) Boston Revision Mental Control Subtest- Months BackwardsMMSE sub-item： WORLD spelled backwards  |\n| Working Memory/Inhibitory Functioning  | Boston Revision Mental Control Subtest- Months Forward WAIS-III Digit Span Backward Span Letter Fluency (Letter F) Boston Revision Mental Control Subtest- Months BackwardsMMSE sub-item： WORLD spelled backwards  |\n| Working Memory/Inhibitory Functioning  | Boston Revision Mental Control Subtest- Months Forward WAIS-III Digit Span Backward Span Letter Fluency (Letter F) Boston Revision Mental Control Subtest- Months BackwardsMMSE sub-item： WORLD spelled backwards  |\n| Language  | Boston Revision Mental Control Subtest- Months Forward WAIS-III Digit Span Backward Span Letter Fluency (Letter F) Boston Revision Mental Control Subtest- Months BackwardsMMSE sub-item： WORLD spelled backwards  |\n| Language  | Boston Revision Mental Control Subtest- Months Forward WAIS-III Digit Span Backward Span Letter Fluency (Letter F) Boston Revision Mental Control Subtest- Months BackwardsMMSE sub-item： WORLD spelled backwards  |\n| Language  | Boston Revision Mental Control Subtest- Months Forward WAIS-III Digit Span Backward Span Letter Fluency (Letter F) Boston Revision Mental Control Subtest- Months BackwardsMMSE sub-item： WORLD spelled backwards  |\n| Language  | Boston Revision Mental Control Subtest- Months Forward WAIS-III Digit Span Backward Span Letter Fluency (Letter F) Boston Revision Mental Control Subtest- Months BackwardsMMSE sub-item： WORLD spelled backwards  |\n| Language  | Semantic Fluency (Animal)  |\n| Language  | Test of Reception of Grammar (TROG)， selected items  |\n| Language  | MMMSE subitems (repetition， comprehension， writing)  |\n| Language  | Clock Drawing to Command and Copy MMSE Intersecting Pentagons  |\n| Visuoconstruction  | Clock Drawing to Command and Copy MMSE Intersecting Pentagons  |\n| Learning and Memory  | Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R)  |\n| Learning and Memory  | MMSE Orientation Items  |\n| Learning and Memory  | MMSE 3-word Recall (from screening)  |\n| Psychological  | Mood Likert Scale  |\n|  | Pain Assessment  |\n| Functional Status  | Instrumental and Basic Activities of Daily Living (completed by caregiver)  |\n\n【15】Components of Perioperative Cognitive Anesthesia Network administered to Mr. M.\n\n【16】During a patient-caregiver-team feedback session， Mr. M learned that general anesthesia was the only choice for anes-thetic management given the location of the mucocele and theextent of surgery required. The neuropsychology team educated Mr. M and his caregiver about delirium， his risk for delirium， and instructed Mr. M's caregiver on how to check for delirium with the Confusion Assessment Measure-ICU (CAM-ICU) . For preoperative cognitive optimization， the neuropsychology team encouraged Mr. M to increase his CPAP compliance， pursue behavioral interventions for mood symptoms， and schedule a consult with a geriatric specialist to streamline his medica-tions for polypharmacy and high anticholinergic burden. The anesthesia team additionally recommended increased partici-pation in physical activity and dietary modification to increase functional reserve. Due to Mr. M's history of chondrocalcinosis， the intraoperative team was given specific instructions for po-sitioning (e.g.，placed patient in a Trendelenburg position， allow left armrest on his side， etc.). Results and recommendations were documented in the medical record and shared with other providers. After a discussion with his caregiver and the team， Mr. M decided to postpone the procedure. He stated that he did not wish to repeat another episode of prolonged hospital-ization or risk further cognitive decline.\n\n【17】Approximately 13% of community-dwelling adults with cog-nitive impairment develop delirium . In the perioperative context， the incidence of delirium among older adults with cog nitive impairment increases to up to 66% ， and comorbid delirium and memory and executive functions deficits leads to increased utilization of emergency/rehabilitation services and prolonged hospitalization above and beyond delirium or dementia alone . As such， identifying the presence of cog-nitive impairment in older adults presenting for elective sur-gery assists calculating the cost/benefit ratio of a procedure. Failure to assess preoperative cognitive impairment may mis-represent patients'risk for delirium and represents a roadblock to early detection of delirium . ldentifying cognitive impair-ment in older adults could guide intraoperative and postop-erative care. In adults with dementia， interventions tailored to specific risk factors (e.g.， disorientation， sleep deprivation， dehydration， immobility) may reduce the number and dura-tion of delirium episodes .\n\n【18】In this case report， Mr. M's performance did not warrant a de-mentia diagnosis. The neurobehavioral exam revealed cognitive and behavioral decline with respect to his previous neuropsy-chological assessment in 2016. The neurobehavioral exami-nation identified potential targets for behavioral and medical interventions (e.g.， intermittent compliance with CPAP ma-chine and dietary recommendations， frailty， high risk of anti-cholinergic toxicity， and limited response to pharmacotherapy for mood symptoms) that， if addressed before surgery， could maximize postoperative outcomes.\n\n【19】Mild neurocognitive disorder or mild cognitive impairment(MCI) is an intermediate stage between normal cognition and dementia； wherein adults may exhibit cognitive insufficien-cies on objective testing in the context of preserved functional independence (e.g.， pay bills， manage medications， prepare meals) . In the perioperative context， MCI has been as-sociated with alterations in inflammatory processes and in-creased risk for delirium . Identifying MCI before surgery may， therefore， help to reduce postoperative delirium rates. MCl can present with single and multi-domain weaknesses(e.g.， amnestic， non-amnestic， mixed) . Mr. M exhibited more executive dysfunction and some of his scores were 1 to1.5 standard deviations lower at our testing relative to pre-vious reported testing. At the time of our evaluation， he was oriented and showed intact comprehension. Changes in com-prehension and orientation after surgery would flag for fur-ther consultation and may indicate a delirium process rather than preexisting cognitive impairment.\n\n【20】Despite the well-documented relationship between preoperative cognition and postoperative outcomes， cognitive assessmentis not a routine part of the preoperative evaluation. Our ter-tiary care preoperative clinic includes a two-phase cognitive screening. Phase one requires preoperative medical profes sionals to complete a 3-minute frailty-cognitive screener for all patients age >64. Patients who evidence signs of frailty and cognitive vulnerabilities on the screening tool are referred for phase 2， which involves a more extensive neurobehavioral ex-amination that is administered and interpreted by neuropsy-chologists trained in dementia， postoperative cognitive decline， and delirium. Subsequently， recommendations are developed and disseminated to the patient and the anesthesia and re-ferring physicians and documented in the patient's medical record. Additionally， the inpatient and surgical teams as well as other allied professionals (e.g.， geriatric specialists)， are alerted and encouraged to monitor and/or consult in the case in order to mitigate delirium-related morbidity.\n\n【21】The neurobehavioral examination offers an opportunity to acquire additional information on biopsychosocial risk fac-tors as well as caregiver involvement and support. Active pa-tient participation in clinical decision-making is consistent with the effort to improve quality of care and in line with the Institute of Medicine's desire to provide care that is consis-tent with the patient's preferences and needs . Evidence suggests that clinical recommendations that are consistent with the patient's values yield improved outcomes and in-creased compliance (e.g.， engagement in health-related be-haviors， medication adherence) . Promoting patient-centered care is also in the spirit of the Hippocratic Oath and consistent with a clinician's ethical obligation to promote a patient's autonomy . For Mr. M， our routine frailty-cogni-tive screener， coupled with the neurobehavioral examination， fostered dialogue between the patient， his caregiver， and cli-nicians. Importantly， our multidisciplinary and tiered assess ment ultimately gave Mr. M and his caregiver an opportunity to make an informed medical decision.\n\n【22】A clinical trial evaluating the cost-effectiveness of the neurobe-havioral examination is needed. Moreover， future researchers may wish to determine whetherthe neurobehavioral examina-tions serve as an intervention for patients with cognitive vul-nerabilities， presenting for a preoperative workup.\n\n【23】Conclusions\n\n【24】Partnerships with neuropsychology professionals could improve hospital resources by identifying patients who are at high risk for postoperative cognitive complications， which will inform perioperative expectations and assist in postoperative planning.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The basis of the diagnosis was from the increased abdominal complaints and left hip pain. The investigation with ultrasound and abdominal CT scan obtained the mass on the left kidney， and after the radical nephrectomy surgery， the examination of the pathology found multicystic kidney disease with extensive necrosis with malignant markings in some preparations. Kidney tumours rarely occur in patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis. This is allegedly due to the inactivation of a tumour suppressor gene. Therefore， periodic checks are necessary to detect the presence of malignancy in patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis. As these cases are rarely reported in Indonesia and there is often a delay in diagnosis， it is expected to add insight to early diagnosis and provide optimal therapy to prolong patient life expectancy. Early detection and treatment are expected to provide a better prognosis and prolong the patient's life expectancy.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Kidney tumour， Long term hemodialysis， Renal Cell Carcinoma\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Since the first hemodialysis machine was demonstrated in the1940s， this machine is thought to be capable of prolonging a person's life and curing uremia symptoms. In the 1970s， the spread of this machine has expanded and can save the lives of patients who have acute kidney failure or end-stage renal failureToday， almost millions of people around the world are ben-efiting from long-term regular hemodialysis. The number of patients undergoing hemodialysis increases by 5% annually. Im-proving the quality of replacement therapy for kidney function has an impact on increasing the life expectancy of patients. Apartfrom that， several studies have concluded that an increase in cases of malignancy in people undergoing hemodialysis. \n\n【4】A cohort study of patients with terminal renal failure in Aus-tralia reported a high incidence of cancer in dialysis patients compared with those not undergoing dialysis with an incidence rate of 1.35 (95%IK=1.27 to 1.45).  Even recent studies report， of 454 patients undergoing hemodialysis， 12 percent of them died from malignancy. It is the third after cardiovascular disease(52%) and infectious diseases (25%). \n\n【5】The mechanism of carcinogenesis in long term dialysis re-mains unclear. Chronic oxidative stress， decreased immune system， viral infection and some renal diseases such as renal cyst disease are thought to be risk factors causing the emergence of malignancy. Also， it should be noted that patients with terminal stage kidney disease have genomic disorders that may also have a role in cancer formation. This genomic disorder may be caused by the buildup of uremic toxins such as advanced glycation end products (ages) or homocysteine.  In this case， we reported patients diagnosed with a kidney tumour and have undergone long regular hemodialysis. As these cases are rarely reported in Indonesia， and there is often a delay in diagnosis， it is expected to add insight to early diagnosis and provide optimal therapy to prolong patient life expectancy.\n\n【6】A 31-year-old Balinese male came to Sanglah Hospital in July2014. The patient came with a stomach enlargement complaint.\n\n【7】The stomach is felt enlarged for two months before hospital-ized. The stomach is felt increasingly more significant， especially on the left abdomen. In addition to enlarging， the patient also felt the pain in the left abdomen. The pain is getting worse for two days before hospitality.\n\n【8】The patient has been diagnosed with chronic renal failure since nine years ago and has been undergoing routine hemodial-ysis for two times a week. Patients had used Continuous Am-bulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) about one year ago but failed. Patients also have hypertension and have been taking medication for a long time. The patient’s sister also suffered terminal kidney failure and died almost a year ago.\n\n【9】The patient is fully alert with the blood pressure of 130/80mmHg. Regular pulse was increased 108 times/minute， with the patient's respiratory rate is still within normal limits. The patient's pain scale is obtained . The eye conjunctival exami-nation is pale. The patient's heart and lung examinations are all within normal limits. On abdominal examination， the abdomen is distended， with a maximum abdominal circumference of 98cm. From palpation， there was a palpable mass in the left lumbar region with solid consistency， approximately 10x12 cm in size， with tenderness. Pain positive in the left positive costovertebral angle.\n\n【10】Laboratory results obtained urea nitrogen serum 44.08 mg /dL， serum creatinine 6.51 mg / dL， serum calcium 10.28 mg /dL， serum inorganic phosphor 6.02 mg / dL， serum albumin 3.7g / dL， hemoglobin 6.36 g / dL，MCV 81 fL，MCH 28 pg， white blood cell count 7，2x103 / uL and platelet count 173x103/uL.\n\n【11】From ultrasound examination， a large mass with an unre-solved border on the left kidney covering almost all of the renal parenchyma with the impression corresponds to a heteroge-neous solid mass present in the left kidney . While the results of abdominal CT scan of patients found in the left kidney there is a solid heterogeneous mass with cystic components in it that fill the left kidney， it firmly bordered with uneven edges， measuring 10.9 x10.6x22.7 cm which with contrast partially contrast enhancement .\n\n【12】At that time the patient was diagnosed with a suspicious left kidney tumour towards the renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and polycystic kidney right. On August 19， 2014， the patient under-went radical nephrectomy surgery and performed an analogical examination of anatomical pathology. From the results of the ex-amination was found multicystic kidney disease with extensive necrosis with malignant markings in some preparations .\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Patients with terminal stage renal failure due to diabetes， nephroangiosclerosis， polycystic kidney disease， urinary tract abnormalities and glomerular disorders have significantly bene-fited from renal replacement therapy and are even able to pro-long the life expectancy of a person. However， chronic renal failure with prolonged dialysis makes them in a chronic oxida-tive stress condition that is closely related to the occurrence of cancer. This chronic oxidative stress situation results from the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) capable of dam-aging cellular structures， including lipid membranes， proteins and nucleic acidsSome risk factors that can trigger the growth of cancer cells in the kidney organs include smoking， excess weight or obesity， some work related to pesticides， asbestos and cadmium metal. Inaddition to that， some things are unavoidable risk factors，such as races where Afro-American race is more commonly affected， male sex is twice as risky， and family history suffers from renal malignancy.】\n\n【15】Patients suffering from terminal stage kidney failure by un-dergoing regular hemodialysis have a high risk of developing kidney tumours. In these patients， the patient has nearly nine years undergoing regular hemodialysis. This situation made patients more at risk for kidney tumours. Dunnill et al.  reported the first 14 of 30 patients undergoing hemodialysis at the time of autopsy to find a tumour in their kidneys.  In2005， the United States Renal Data System (USRDS)， found an increased incidence of renal tumours in patients undergoing prolonged hemodialysis.  Ishikawa et al.  state that， the length of a person performing hemodialysis effect on the occurrence of kidney tumours in the person. The 10-year study says that the emergence of one of the largest kidney tumours in the second year and the ninth year of a person undergoing hemodialysis.\n\n【16】This patient is experiencing terminal renal failure， which was caused due to known polycystic kidney disease from ultrasound examination. The patient’s sister also died because of terminal renal failure. This linkage of renal disease between these families makes us suspect the presence of genetic diseases in these pa-tients. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common disease of hereditary renal disorder， which occurs in 8-10% of terminal renal failure patients.  Keith et al. reported that RCC as a severe complication of ADPKD， but the incidence of RCC in ADPKD is still controversial because the number of patients with ADPKD diagnosis remains unclear. To detect RCC in ADPKD is not an easy matter， although using a CT scan or MRI， this is because the renal architectural structure has been damaged by ADPKD.\n\n【17】A long duration of hemodialysis is thought to contribute to the development of renal tumours in patients with terminal renal failure. Sumiko et al.  reported that connexin (Cx)32， a gap junction that acts as a suppressor gene tumour， fails to function due to hypermethylation of the Cx 32 gene promoter region that occurs in patients undergoing hemodialysis. \n\n【18】Connexin (Cx) 32 is a protein encoded by the Gap junction beta-1 protein gene(GJB1). The Cx 32 function is still not widely known， but several studies have shown that this gene acts as a suppressor gene tumour in renal tumour growth.  Hirai et al.  also observed the same thing. They suggest that hy-permethylation in the promoter region Cx 32 causes regulation to decrease from Cx 32 to facilitate the onset of RCC. \n\n【19】In these patients， radical nephrectomy surgery was per-formed. In this type of operation， the entire kidney including the adrenal glands and surrounding tissues are removed. Surgery is the main therapy of RCC， though other treatments can be consid-ered such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy in RCC although the results are not as good as surgery. In some developed countries， they also consider immunological therapy， but the results are still unsatisfactory， and the side effects are still too risky.  The result of the examination of patient's pathology showed off10109multicystic kidney disease with extensive necrosis with a mark of malignancy in some dosage. Some studies say the duration of hemodialysis affected the type of pathology of renal tumours. Sassa et al. reported that in Japan， patients with hemodial-ysis duration less than ten years showed clear cell carcinoma as the most RCC type. Whereas in patients undergoing hemodialy-sis between 10-20 years obtained papillary cell carcinoma andacquired cystic disease of the kidney associated RCC as the most common form. Whereas in patients more than 20 years under-going hemodialysis obtained renal sarcoma type as the most tumours.  This is also conveyed by Matsuda et al. ， that the duration of hemodialysis determines the type of cell pathology of RCC. Where patients are undergoing hemodialysis for more than ten years if RCC is found， the prognosis will be worse.  Therefore， it is advisable if the patient has undergone long-term hemodialysis periodic examination needs to be done to detect the emergence of malignancy.\n\n【20】Summary\n\n【21】A 31-year-old Balinese male， who have undergone hemodialysis for nine years and then diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma(RCC).

{"seq_id": "53d3633b-faa4-4224-8dcd-24eab689c9b3", "title": null, "text": "【0】Background\n\n【1】Postobstructive pulmonary edema (POPE)， also known as neg ative-pressure pulmonary edema， is a rare form of no- car-diogenic pulmonary edema. It is a potentially life-threaten ing complication in which pulmonary edema occurs shortly after relief of an upper airway obstruction. The incidence of POPE has been reported to be as high as 1 in 1000 general anesthetic cases and commonly presents as acute respiratory distress that requires immediate intervention ， but POPE de-veloping after non-lethal hanging has not been reported wide-ly. We report a case of POPE in an adolescent girl following ac-cidental near-hanging.\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 14-year-old girl was admitted to our hospital with a his-tory of accidental hanging. She had been trapped by a rope around the neck while playing in the garden. After this event， she was unconscious. While being transported to the hospital， she started breathing laboriously， breathing difficulty worsened with time， with increased cough and expectoration of blood-stained frothy secretions. At admission， she was unconscious with Glasgow coma scale (GCS) at 7 (E1V1M5)， both pupils were equal and reactive to light， she was afebrile， with heart rate of 140/min， respiratory rate of 44/min， and blood pressure of110/60 mmHg. The Sp02 was 81% on room air. The child had chest indrawing and chest auscultation revealed bilateral crep-itations. She had bruises and abrasions on her neck. The other results of physical examination were unremarkable. The child had 2 tonic clonic seizures， treated with 4 mg of Midazolam. In view of severe respiratory distress and neurological wors-ening， the child was intubated orally using a cuffed 5.5mm en-dotracheal tube. She received 160 mg of Propofol， 30 mg of Rocuronium and 0.2 mg of Alfentanil. Pink frothy secretions were noted below the glottis. The child was mechanically ven-tilated with volume-controlled mode and ventilatory settings were： tidal volume 6ml/kg (weight： 40 kg)， rate 16/min，I/E：2.5， Fi02 100%， and PEEP 10 cm H20. The vital parameters post-ventilation were heart rate of 140/min， blood pressure 120/85mmHg， and Sp02 88% on Fi02 at 100%. The brain and cer-vical CT scan and the supra-aortic trunks Doppler ultrasonog raphy results were normal. The electrocardiogram showed a sinus tachycardia. A chest x-ray showed bilateral diffuse infil-trates， primarily on the right， consistent with pulmonary ede-ma， and a normal cardiac silhouette . Arterial blood gases on 100% fraction inspired oxygen revealed pO2 52 mm Hg， pCO2 39 mm Hg. Ph 7.43， and HCO3 25 mEq/L. All hema-tological and biochemical parameters were normal. During the next 48 hours，the patient was kept intubated and sedated with Midazolam， 0.3 mg/kg/h I. PEEP was gradually decreased to5 cm of H20 and Fi02 was simultaneously decreased to 0.\nmaintaining SpO2 between 91% and 96%. On the third day of hospitalization， a chest x-ray showed resolution of the pulmo-nary edema. The patient recovered consciousness and was he-modynamically stable. She was then weaned from the ventilator and extubated. She remained asymptomatic，maintained satu-ration above 95% in room air， and had normal results on neu-rological examination. She was discharged home 4 days later.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】The first description of POPE was made in an animal model in1927  and was first described in humans in 1973 . Two dis-tinct subclasses of POPE have been described： type l is associat-ed with forceful inspiratory effort in the context of an acute air-way obstruction， whereas type ll occurs after relief of a chronic partial airway obstruction (eg， adenoidectomy， laryngeal mass resection， or reduction of a hypertrophic redundant uvula) . The most common cause of POPE type I remains postextuba-tion laryngospasm. Other causes of obstruction of upper air-way leading to POPE include： hanging， mononucleosis， strangu-lation， near drowning， sleep apnea， biting of the endotracheal tube while intubated， croup and epiglottitis (especially in chil-dren)， choking， foreign body， postoperative vocal cord paralysis， administration of muscle relaxant at the beginning of an inhala-tional induction of anesthesia (paralysis of glossal muscles be-fore diaphragm)， and following aspiration of pneumothorax or massive pleural effusion .The incidence of POPE in all anes-thetics is 0.05% to 0.1%. POPE may also follow strangulation or near hanging， but such cases are very rare in children. This is probably due to the high mortality rate of suicidal hangings.\n\n【6】The pathophysiology of POPE is multifactorial， involving com-ponents of negative pressure pulmonary edema， hypoxia， and a hyperadrenergic state . The initiating event in POPE is the generation of markedly negative transpulmonary pressure dur-ing a forceful inspiration against a closed upper airway .\n\n【7】This exaggerated negative intrapleural pressure leads to in-crease in pulmonary blood flow due to an increase in venous return to the right side of the heart； the sudden influx of blood to the thorax also causes a decrease in the flow from the left side as a result of increased afterload. This combina-tion causes increased pulmonary blood volume and elevat-ed pulmonary venous pressures，which lead to an increase in hydrostatic pressures and edema formation . In addi-tion， high negative intrapleural pressure is transmitted to the interstitium and causes an increase in the hydrostatic gradi-ent， favoring transudation of fluid from the pulmonary capil-lary to the pulmonary interstitial space， resulting in pulmonary edema . Healthy young men who generate greater negative intrapleural pressures have an increased incidence of POPE， supporting the importance of vigorous inspiratory efforts in the development of POPE . The hypoxemia due to upper airway obstruction leads to increased pre- and post-capillary pulmonary vascular resistance in a nonuniform manner， thus elevating the pulmonary vascular resistance. The hypoxemia associated with a hyper-adrenergic state precipitates pulmo-nary edema . Fremont et al concluded that both the ede-ma fluid/plasma protein ratio and the rate of net alveolar flu-id clearance in patients with POPE were in the same range as patients with acute hydrostatic pulmonary edema， providing further support for the hypothesis that hydrostatic forces are the primary mechanism behind POPE and that the alveolar ep-ithelium remains functionally intact .\n\n【8】POPE usually presents with rapid onset of acute respirato-ry failure， with dyspnea， tachypnea， and respiratory distress. Additional signs are paradoxical ventilation， pink frothy spu-tum， stridor， and severe agitation . The chest radiograph findings of pulmonary edema support the diagnosis.\n\n【9】In judicial hanging， the death is due to fatal injury to the cervi-cal spine， brain stem， and larynx； but suicide attempts or acci-dents usually cause compression of the internal jugular veins and the carotid arteries， leading to cerebral hypoxia and air-way compression， and finally resulting in global hypoxia . Most hospital deaths following near-fatal hangings are due to severe pulmonary edema or pneumonia ； the pulmonary edema may be from a neurogenic origin or secondary to neg-ative intrathoracic pressures (POPE).\n\n【10】The initial phase of neurogenic pulmonary edema results from a centrally mediated， massive， sympathetic discharge. This discharge produces intense， generalized， but transient，vasoconstriction， with a resultant shift of blood from the high-resistance systemic circulation to the low-resistance pulmonary circulation. In addition， the hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstric-tion also increases permeability by disrupting the permeabil-ity barrier. Neurogenic pulmonary edema is often recognized after devastating and usually lethal brain injury .\n\n【11】It is likely that the prognosis for patients with POPE after stran-gulation injury is not as grave as that for patients with neu-rogenic pulmonary edema. Greater brain injury is caused in the context of neurogenic edema and this would be the major prognostic factor determining the ultimate outcome. Negative-pressure edema may result from transient airway obstruction， and resolution and recovery would be expected. It is difficult， if not impossible， to determine the initial cause of pulmonary edema in survivors of strangulation injury， although good neu-rological recovery suggests a brief episode of obstruction and negative pressure as the cause . We believe that the pul-monary edema in our case was due to negative pressure sec-ondary to sudden compression of airways. The total neurolog-ical recovery after extubation and the normal brain imagery support this diagnosis. Initial unconsciousness in our case may have resulted from transient jugular venous compres-sion aggravated by general hypoxia due to acute pulmonary edema. Other causes of pulmonary edema， including aspira-tion pneumonia， iatrogenic volume overload， and cardiogen-ic cause， were excluded.\n\n【12】Treatment strategies vary according to the severity of symptoms of POPE. Supportive measures include maintaining a patent airway and ensuring adequate oxygenation via supplemental oxygen with the addition of positive end-expiratory pressure(PEEP) guided by pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas deter-minations， but severe cases require intubation and mechani-cal ventilation with PEEP. The role of diuretics in management of POPE is unclear.\n\n【13】With therapy， almost all patients improve within 24 to 48 hours and have a normal result on chest x-ray .\n\n【14】Conclusions\n\n【15】POPE， also known as negative-pressure pulmonary edema， is essentially a complication of laryngospasm. Airway obstruction is the main cause of morbidity and subsequent mortality in the survivors of hangings； pulmonary edema may subsequently develop in such patients. In most instances， POPE is a revers-ible process once it is recognized and properly treated .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "17249f40-102a-484c-98f6-1bb724d4942e", "title": null, "text": "【0】Background：\n\n【1】Thyroid malignant lesions mostly present as an anterior neck mass with or without compressive symptoms. Infrequently， metastases from extra-thyroid neoplasms migrate to the thyroid gland. These lesions most com-monly arise from renal cell carcinoma (RCC)， which is the primary kidney malignancy in adults. This case par-allels one of the longest latency periods described in the literature from a primary RCC with metastasis to the thyroid gland (TG).\n\n【2】Case Report： We report a case of an 88-year-old female patient with past medical history of RCC resected 25 years earlier， who presented to the Emergency Department with a large left anterior neck mass causing dyspnea and stridor due to intra-tracheal extension. The airway symptoms progressed rapidly， and she required emergent manage-ment to secure the airway in the operating room.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】This case reports a rare instance in which RCC metastasis presented with intra-tracheal extension causing air-way compromise and the need for emergent airway management. It is the first time that use of cold instru-ments has been documented to excise RCC's intra-luminal tracheal lesion to secure the airway in an emergent case in a safe manner. With this surgical approach， the airway is secured by endotracheal intubation after ex-cision of an intra-luminal tracheal lesion， with the benefit of avoiding awake tracheostomy in a patient with a distorted neck anatomy. Also， this case reinforces that metastatic RCC to the thyroid gland can occur 25 yearsafter initial diagnosis. For this reason， we advocate lifelong monitoring in patients with the diagnosis of RCC.\n\n【5】Keywords： Carcinoma， Renal Cell · Dyspnea ·Neoplasm Metastasis · Respiratory Sounds· Thyroid Gland ·Tracheal NeoplasmsThyroid gland (TG) neoplasms are generally found to be primary glandular lesions， most commonly papillary thyroid carcinoma. Rarely， metastatic lesions are found in the TG and most com-monly arise from renal cell carcinoma (RCC)， which is the primary kidney malignancy in adults . It is well established that RCC is more common in men. However， RCC with metastasis to the TG is more common in women . These tumors frequently metas-tasize to the lungs and bones， and sporadically invade the TG.\n\n【6】Patients with RCC metastasis to the TG can present with a pal-pable nodule， goiter， neck swelling， dysphagia， dyspnea， dyspho-nia， cough，stridor， and/or tracheal compression， and/ortrache-al invasion，leading to respiratory compromise， as in this report. Fine-needle aspiration is both highly sensitive and specific and is the criterion standard for diagnosis of thyroid masses . If clinically feasible， total or partial thyroidectomy with com-plete resection of the tumor is the preferred treatment. Close follow-up should be given because recurrence may occur， par-ticularly if the tumor has spread to adjacent structures or if thyroid metastases exceed 3.5 cm . On the other hand，non-surgical candidates may be treated with systemic therapy .\n\n【7】Extensive lesions may present with respiratory compromise； therefore， it is imperative to secure the airway. In this study we aim to report our experience with a rare case of RCC me-tastasis to the TG with extension into the trachea causing dys-pnea 25 years after the initial diagnosis. We report， for the first time， an alternative and safe surgical approach to secure the airway in this unusual emergent case.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】An 88-year-old female patient presented to the Emergency Department reporting a 1-week history of inspiratory stridor after a 2-week history of progressive shortness of breath. Also， she reported intermittent hemoptysis and a 6-week history of enlarging anterior neck mass causing dysphagia to solids. The patient reported having a previous thyroid fine-needle aspira-tion done 5 years earlier， with findings suspicious for follicular neoplasm. Successive thyroid ultrasounds showed mass en-largement， although no surgical intervention was performed because the patient was lost to follow-up.\n\n【10】The patient's past medical history included chronic conditions such as hypertension， diabetes mellitus， coronary artery dis-ease， myocardial infarction 1 month prior to our evaluation， and diabetic peripheral neuropathy leading to pain and de-creased sensation in bilateral lower extremities. Her past sur-gical history included sterilization and right total nephrecto-my 25 years earlier due to a kidney-confined RCC\n\n【11】Upon evaluation， the patient was found to be in acute respira-tory distress. An ill-defined，indurated，anterolateral left neck mass with irregular borders was noted to be causing displace-ment of the trachea to the right. A flexible laryngoscopy was performed and a normal laryngeal anatomy and function with mild bulging of the left lateral pharyngeal wall without ob-struction of the glottis was observed. A flexible bronchosco-py showed a tracheal mass 4 cm below the true vocal cords， obstructing approximately 80% of the airway due to a ball-valve effect. CT scan without contrast showed a large homoge-neous， infiltrative， and poorly defined left anterior neck mass arising from the left thyroid lobe measuring 4.1x5.0×5.1 cm， with direct invasion of the trachea with an intra-luminal com-ponent measuring 1 cm in diameter . The mass ex-tended inferiorly into the left superior mediastinum . Furthermore， multiple pulmonary nodules associated with met-astatic disease to the lungs were found .\n\n【12】The patient was taken emergently to the operating room， where a direct laryngoscopy and rigid bronchoscopy were per-formed under general anesthesia. A successful excision of the intra-luminal tracheal lesion using cold instruments preformed. The lesion was pedunculated and originated from the left an-terolateral wall. Minimal bleeding was noticed after excision. Immediately， a trans-oral endotracheal intubation was safely achieved. Once the airway was secured， an open biopsy and tracheotomy were performed. The transtracheal biopsy of the thyroid and anterior neck mass revealed nearly complete re-placement of the thyroid by clear cell carcinoma. Tumor cells were arranged in nests， and disclosed clear cytoplasm， distinct cytoplasmic membranes， and a fine capillary network around tumor nests. Focal pleomorphic hyperchromatic cells were seen， some with prominent nucleoli . The tumor im-munohistochemistry profile confirmed a metastatic clear cell RCC， as tumor cells disclosed strong immunoreaction to RCC， CD10， EMA， and vimentin . Immunostains for TTF-1， CK5/6， p40， and p63 were negative.\n\n【13】Subsequently，abdominal renal protocol CT scan with i.v. con-trast showed no evidence of new renal primary or metastat-ic lesions. The patient was discharged on the 5th day after admission， without complications. She was referred to the Hematology/Oncology service for evaluation. Chemotherapy was determined to be the best choice of treatment at this stage of advanced disease. After a chemotherapy regimen was initi-ated， the patient was lost to follow-up.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Most thyroid masses are benign， but when malignant， prima-ry TG neoplasms are the most common. Nevertheless， meta-static masses to the TG do occur (2.1%) and should alwaysremain as part of the differential diagnosis of an anterior neck lesion . In the USA， metastases to the TG most common-ly arise from primary tumors in the kidneys， lungs， colorectal， and/or head and neck cancers .\n\n【16】Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) most commonly metastasizes to the lung， bone， lymph nodes， liver， adrenal glands， and brain. Metastasis to the TG is uncommon ， but RCC is the most com-mon type of metastatic malignant lesion found in the thyroid. RCC has an indolent metastatic process and is known to recur de-cades after the primary tumor has been excised . In this case， metastatic lesions were found in the TG and lungs 25 years after right nephrectomy， without evidence of abdominal recurrence.\n\n【17】RCC metastasis to the head and neck region appear to occur through different mechanisms. One of the postulated mecha-nisms of RCC spread is via the vascular system . However， other spreading patterns have been proposed， such as ret-rograde lymphatic course to the thoracic duct， right-to-left heart shunts， metastasis via Baton's vertebral venous plexus to the chest， and retrograde travel to the head and neck . Li et al  state that metastatic cancer cells may enter a pro-liferative state and subsequently form a new tumor on a dif-ferent organ or may become dormant. Potential mechanisms to change from dormant to proliferative states have been pro-posed and include： angiogenesis， immune response， cellular factors， and signaling pathways. Although cancer metastasis has been widely studied， the exact mechanisms by which RCC spreads to the TG are still unknown， particularly 25 years af-ter initial presentation.\n\n【18】Locally advanced thyroid lesions with tracheal extension are commonly suspected to be anaplastic thyroid carcinoma， which carries an extremely poor prognosis. Due to insufficient pub-lished data， RCC metastasis to the TG has uncertain clinical significance when compared to RCC metastasis to other or-gans .\n\n【19】Metastatic lesions to the TG may be treated surgically (ie， lo-bectomy or total thyroidectomy) if confined to the TG paren-chyma， or with systemic therapy if extra-thyroid extension is found .\n\n【20】Generally， RCC is diagnosed at advanced stages due to its slow-growing nature， and the ample space inside the abdo-men， facilitating growth without noticeable symptomatolo-gy. It is also known for its indolent metastatic progression. Metastases to the TG have been reported concomitantly with the renal diagnosis， preceding the tumor diagnosis， as well as many years later. Villumsen et al  reported concurrent TG metastasis in 30-40% of patients with RCC. Indolent metasta-ses show clinical symptomatology 3-5 years after initial diag-nosis， but may take more than 20 years. Our patient present-ed with metastases to the thyroid and lungs 25 years after diagnosis of the primary RCC. No intra-abdominal lesions were observed， negating the possibility of a second primary lesion.\n\n【21】It is important to emphasize the ability of cancer cells to re-main dormant for many years.\n\n【22】The patient described in this report presented with tumor mi-gration to the lungs， and a locally advanced metastasis to the TG with direct invasion into the tracheal lumen， causing in-spiratory stridor and airway compromise. Tracheal invasion usually occurs from direct extension of neoplastic lesions of neighboring tissues， including the thyroid， larynx， lymph nodes， and esophagus.\n\n【23】Byard  presented a case report of a 62-year-old male pa-tient who had acute respiratory distress due to RCC metas-tasis occluding the tracheal lumen at the carina， and conse-quently died. Testini et al  presented the first case of RCC metastasis to the TG， causing compressive symptoms and air-way compromise that was successfully treated via total thy-roidectomy and tracheostomy. Additionally， Watanabe et al \ndescribed the case of a 74-year-old man who presented with direct invasion of the tracheal lumen by RCC， treated by pal-liative implantation of an expandable metallic stent to main-tain airway patency.\n\n【24】Patients with large anterior neck masses present anatomi-cal distortion， rendering a difficult technical intervention to secure the airway， leading to a potentially dangerous sur-gery. Therefore， it may be difficult to find the airway during awake tracheostomy. Additionally， initial endotracheal intu-bation can dislodge the tracheal mass and cause a fatal dis-tal airway occlusion.\n\n【25】In this report， we show， for the first time， the efficacy of op-erative rigid bronchoscopy and use of cold instruments for removal of the intra-tracheal lesion to ensure airway paten-cy， followed by endotracheal intubation to secure the airway. After the airway secured by endotracheal intubation， a con-trol open tracheostomy can be performed for adequate air-way management and tracheal lesion site stenting. With this approach， an awake emergent tracheostomy is avoided in apatient with distorted neck anatomy. Moreover， this approach has been shown to be a safe and effective way to excise in-tra-luminal tracheal masses causing acute airway obstruction in patients with extensive thyroid lesions.\n\n【26】Hemorrhage inside the airway is a major concern when perform-ing intra-tracheal lesion excision. Notably， RCCs are known to be solid and highly vascular tumors . Aziz et al  report-ed no significant difference in vascular density between prima-ry and metastatic RCC lesions. Furthermore， an association be-tween RCC tumor vascularity and post-biopsy hemorrhage has not been established. Therefore， tumor vascularity should not be considered when choosing an anatomic preference of primary versus metastatic lesion biopsy. Even though the bleeding risk is always present， maintaining airway patency and successful ventilation is the primary goal when performing intra-luminal tracheal surgery. Surgical methods that prevent hemorrhage should be used， especially inside the airway. Although cold in-strument intervention is not the definitive method to minimize bleeding， this case shows that it is a safe alternative in a distal， intra-tracheal airway obstruction by RCC tumors.\n\n【27】Although metastasis to the TG is infrequent， patients with a history of RCC should be followed for possible indolent tumor spread to distant organs. This pathology is slow growing， but patients may present with acute life-threatening symptoms when vital organs are involved. In this report we present a case of metastatic RCC to the TG 25 years after initial diagno-sis. For this reason， lifelong monitoring for RCC recurrence isnecessary. Furthermore， we report use of a safe approach to se-cure the airway if the tracheal lumen is involved by the tumor.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

In the current case we report reversal of co-existing RUC and CFS symptoms arising from biotoxin exposures in a genetically susceptible individual.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 25-year-old previously healthy male with new-onset refractory ulcerative colitis (RUC) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) tested negative for autoimmune disease biomarkers. However， urine mycotoxin panel test-ing was positive for trichothecene group and air filter testing from the patient's water-damaged rental house identified the toxic mold Stachybotrys chartarum. HLA-DR/DQ testing revealed a multisusceptible haplotype for development of chronic inflammation， and serum chronic inflammatory response syndrome (CIRS) biomark-er testing was positive for highly elevated TGF-beta and a clinically undetectable level of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). Following elimination of biotoxin exposures， VIP replacement therapy， dental extractions， and implementation of a mind body intervention-relaxation response (MBI-RR) program， the patient’s symptoms resolved. He is off medications， back to work， and resuming normal exercise.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】This constellation of RUC and CFS symptoms in an HLA-DR/DQ genetically susceptible individual with biotox-in exposures is consistent with the recently described CIRS disease pathophysiology. Chronic immune distur-bance (turbatio immuno) can be identified with clinically available CIRS biomarkers and may represent a treat-able underlying disease etiology in a subset of genetically susceptible patients with RUC， CFS， and other immune disorders.\n\n【6】MeSH Keywords：\n\n【7】Colitis， Ulcerative· Fatigue Syndrome， Chronic·HLA-DR Antigens ·Mycotoxins·Transforming Growth Factor beta1· Vasoactive Intestinal PeptideOver a million people in the United States alone are afflict-ed by a unique constellation of debilitating neural and cogni-tive symptoms known as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) . Although this complex disorder affects an estimated 2.5% of the US population， CFS has historically not been well recog nized by the medical community . This is likely because the underlying disease pathophysiology is not understood， and the widely diverse associated symptoms have not been effective-ly defined as a recognizable disease entity. Hence， the disor-der is not included in the majority of allopathic medical school textbooks or curricula . Ulcerative colitis (UC) and the relat-ed Crohn disease (CD) are inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) that affect over 1.4 million Americans . In a subset of UC pa-tients，standard-of-care anti-inflammatory therapies，including oral corticosteroids， do not induce remission. These patients are considered to have refractory ulcerative colitis (RUC) .\n\n【8】Individuals with RUC and/or CFS may seek treatment from com-plementary alternative medicine (CAM) providers， and reports of the success or failure of observation-based CAM treatments for these conditions are not routinely incorporated into the ev-idence-based medical literature. CFS thus remains a diagnosis of exclusion made only when other causes of the illness have been ruled out， and the patient meets subjective diagnostic and exclusionary criteria of Fukuda  or other consensus clinical guidelines . Similarly， refractory UC is diagnosed only after a patient has been subjected to the full range of stan-dard-of-care pharmacotherapies (and accompanying adverse effects) with no evidence of remission .\n\n【9】It has recently been demonstrated that exposure of HLA-DR/DQ genetically susceptible individuals to biotoxins (such as those from ciguatera fish， ticks， and \"black molds\") can trig-ger CFS symptoms accompanied by distinctive transcriptomic signatures with quantifiable alterations in chronic inflamma-tory response syndrome (CIRS) biomarkers，including TGF-beta， C4a， and VIP . The link between positive CIRS biomarkers， HLA-DR/DQ haplotype， and multi-system disorders in adult pa-tients has been anecdotally observed but not yet reported in the medical literature. Here， we present the first case report of successfully resolved UC and CFS symptoms arising simul-taneously in a previously healthy， genetically susceptible in-dividual with biotoxin exposures.\n\n【10】Case Report\n\n【11】In July 2013， a 25-year-old man without co-existing diseases presented with recent onset of gastroenteritis and bloody di-arrhea. The episode was preceded by persistent and increas-ing photophobia over approximately 2 years， but otherwise excellent health. Gastroenteritis symptoms resolved within a few weeks without treatment， but recurred in December 2013. The patient was treated with metronidazole without improve-ment， and an auto-immune disease workup \\[including lgA， IgG with subclasses， IgM， IgE， and anti-nuclear Ab (ANA)\\] was neg-ative. Extended inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) panel results for the markers ACCA， ALCA， AMCA， gASCA， and pANCA were also negative and interpreted by the pathologist as “pattern not suggestive of inflammatory bowel disease.\" However， a colonoscopy was performed in February 2014 ； pathology observations from the rectal biopsy were “chronic mucosal colitis with acute activity， consistent with previouslyclinically diagnosed chronic ulcerative colitis.\" Mayo Colitis Scoring was moderate-to-severe， and the patient was started on mesalamine 4.8 g.\n\n| Biomarker  | Results  | Results  | Results  | Reference  | Marker  | Insurance  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Biomarker  | 12/2014  | 03/2015  | 12/2015  | Range  | significance  | Insurance  |\n| HLA-DR/DQ  | HLA-DRB1\\*04HLA-DQB1\\*03  | N/A  | N/A  | N/A  | Inherited tightly linked genes usedas a DNA-based screening method  | Yes  |\n|  | HLA-DRB4\\*01  |  |  |  | for HLA haplotype sensitivity.

During this same time period the patient's overall health deteriorated as he devel-oped multisystem symptoms meeting Fukuda 1994 criteria for CFS， including profound fatigue， post-exertional malaise， cog-nitive impairment， headaches， and multijoint pain. His sub-scale score results for physical and role functioning， as well as body pain， from the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36) were 2 SD below the mean and were consistent with CFS . The UC and CFS symptoms were accompanied by severe photophobia complicated by corneal keratitis， as well as intractable abdominal pain resulting in an inability to work or engage in normal activities. Previously a3-mile a day runner， he was house-bound and often bed-rid-den. The addition of oral corticosteroids (budesonide) to the UC treatment regimen was accompanied by marked exacer-bation of symptoms， including pancreatitis with serum lipase level peaking at 890 U/L (normal 30-210 U/L). The patient con-sumed no alcohol during his illness and had no previous his-tory of pancreatitis， ruling out alcoholic pancreatitis. Serum IgG-4 levels were normal and steroids exacerbated rather than improved the patient's symptoms， suggesting auto-immune pancreatitis (AIP) to be an unlikely etiology. There was no his-tory of abdominal trauma and lipid levels were in the normalrange. Due to the possibility of drug-induced pancreatitis， the decision was made to discontinue mesalamine and steroids， while evaluating alternative therapeutic options.\n\n【15】Seeking the root cause for his multisystem disorder (as well as alternatives to the conventional medicine RUC treatment algorithm， which includes immunomodulators， biologics such as infliximab， and colectomy) the patient consulted a func-tional medicine specialist. Extended autoimmune antibody profiling (Sjogren’s SS-A， SS-B， Smith (SM)， RNP， SCL-70，JO-1， Centromere B， Rheumatoid factor， and DNA DS antibody) and urine mycotoxin testing (aflatoxins ochratoxins and macrocyclic trichothecenes) were performed. All autoantibody tests were negative， but urine mycotoxins were positive for trichothecene group. Environmental testing of the patient’s rental house re-vealed it to be a water-damaged building (WDB) contaminat-ed with the toxic “black mold\" Stachybotrys chartarum. After relocation to a new residence and a 4-times daily cholestyr-amine protocol， the patient showed some improvement， most notably with resolution of pancreatitis symptoms， and lipase levels returned to within the normal reference range (34U/L). However， there was no remission from the colitis， so the pa-tient was restarted on mesalamine 4.8 g.\n\n【16】In December 2014， HLA-DR/DQ testing was performed，which revealed the \\[HLA-DRB1\\*04， HLA-DQB1\\*03，HLA-DRB4\\*hap-lotype associated with immune disturbances， including chronic inflammatory response syndrome (CIRS) . In addition， serumbiomarkers for CIRS were tested and showed highly elevat-ed TGF-B and clinically undetectable VIP . Intranasal VIP replacement therapy (50 mcg， 4 times a day) was initiat-ed， and after 1 week of treatment the patient’s longstanding keratitis/photophobia began to resolve with visual acuity im-proved from 20/200 to 20/30. Follow-up CIRS biomarker test-ing in March 2015 revealed VIP level restored to the normal range at 29 pg/mL. However， the colitis symptoms persisted and TGF-beta， although decreased by 50%， remained elevat-ed at 6980 pg/mL . In addition， the patient’s C4a lev-el was slightly increased from the normal range to 3807 n/mL indicating the presence of a persistent source of inflammation.\n\n【17】As the patient had a history of periodontal disease， a biologi-cal dentist was consulted to screen for occult infections. These were identified in 2 left upper molars accompanied by extensive root resorption. Following tooth extractions， colitis symptoms began resolving within 6 weeks， and over the next 3 months his mesalamine dosage was tapered down to zero as normal bowel function returned. With relief from the colitis symptoms as well as joint pain and muscle soreness， the patient was able to begin a regular yoga-based， mind-body intervention-relax-ation response (MBI-RR) program. Off all medications， and cur-rently taking only multivitamin mineral supplementation， hehas been in colitis remission for over 6 months. His most re-cent S-36 evaluation revealed subscale scores in the range of healthy controls (HC)， indicating continued resolution of CFS symptoms. After the patient had returned to work and resumed daily exercise， CIRS biomarkers were tested in December 2015； the results showed normalized VIP and C4a levels with TGF-beta just outside the normal range .\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】Inflammagen triggering of an aberrant immune response has long been hypothesized as a possible disease mechanism for multisystem chronic diseases， including RUC and CFS. For ex-ample，Epstein-Barr virus subset CFS patients have been shown to improve remarkably after a course of valacyclovir antiviral therapy . Hooper et al. demonstrated greater than 90%positivity rates for mycotoxins (aflatoxins， ochratoxins， and trichothecenes) in urine samples from CFS patients not found in normal controls . More recently， a distinct plasma immune signature of dysregulated pro-and anti-inflammato-ry cytokine activation has been defined early in the course of disease in patients with acute onset but not those with long-standing CFS . Although plasma cytokines and proteomicimmune signatures are intriguing potential biomarkers for immune system disturbance， this testing is not readily avail-able from most clinical laboratories and is often not covered by patient insurance. In addition， these tests do not elucidate the underlying pathophysiology or explain why some individ uals develop symptoms after biotoxin and other inflammagen exposures while others (often from the same family) do not.\n\n【20】In the present case， DNA-based biomarker (HLA-DR/DQ hap-lotype) testing was used as a screen for genetic susceptibil-ity to developing chronic inflammation . Based on the patient's positive HLA results， reflex testing for CIRS bio-markers associated with immune system disturbance was per-formed . Results for TGF-B， C4a， and VIP were consis-tent with a multisystem and multisymptom disease representing the“final common pathway\"in chronic immune activation re-ported by Shoemaker et al. We found that the CIRS bio-markers provided guidance as to the next steps that should be taken to eliminate residual toxin exposures，including vacating the WDB and initiating the cholestyramine protocol. CIRS bio-marker results also served as objective measures for tracking treatment progress. For example， based on his clinical symp-toms， and supported by the VIP biomarker showing undetect-able levels in his serum， the patient was started on intranasal VIP 50 mcg 4 times daily as a targeted therapy. The response was excellent， particularly in the cornea， where keratitis and photophobia began resolving in a few days， with visual acu-ity improved from 20/200 to 20/30. These striking results are not surprising given that clinical applications for reestablish-ment of immune homeostasis using neuropeptides such as VIP are expanding and have been recently reported in diverse non-infectious inflammatory conditions such as sarcoidosis， pulmonary hypertension， and CIRS following exposure to wa-ter-damaged buildings . In addition， VIP is known to be an anti-inflammatory neuropeptide secreted by corneal nerves as a stimulator of wound healing .\n\n【21】To address lingering colitis symptoms， a biological dentist was consulted. Oral-systemic health linkages increasingly point to chronic periodontal inflammation as a potential trigger for autoimmune spectrum diseases， including rheumatoid arthri-tis and coronary artery disease . Successful tooth extrac-tions were followed by improvement in the colitis and marked-ly increased energy levels allowing initiation of a yoga-based mind-body intervention-relaxation response (MBI-RR) pro-gram. Recent studies by Kuo and colleagues have shown sig-nificant clinical improvement in inflammatory bowel diseasewith non-pharmacological therapies such as meditation and yoga through regular elicitation of the relaxation response. Positive clinical effects are mirrored at the molecular level by differential gene expression changes after a 9-week MBI-RR program . Now off medications and back to work， the pa tient continues to benefit from an ongoing wellness program including multivitamin mineral supplementation coordinat-ed by his family practice and functional medicine clinics .\n\n【22】Conclusions\n\n【23】This patient's unusual clinical presentation of CIRS biomarker-positive RUC and CFS required a multidisciplinary medicalteam(family practice， gastroenterology， ophthalmology， biological dentistry， functional medicine， and pathology) to achieve suc-cessful treatment of multi-system symptoms arising from im-mune disturbance. Consistent communication between physi-cians allowed coordination of supportive care while continuing the search for， and elimination of， root causes of his disease. Further multi-disciplinary studies and case reports are clearly needed to firmly establish a link between disturbance of im-mune homeostasis and multi-system diseases such as RUC and CFS. Looking retrospectively at this patient's illness， CIRS bio-marker testing at the first clinical presentation of immune dis-turbance， followed by immediate identification and elimination of biotoxin exposures， could have considerably shortened his illness. We therefore hope that in the future， genetically sus-ceptible patients with reversible conditions arising from biotox-in-mediated immune disturbance (turbatio immuno) will be iden-tified early in their disease course by CIRS biomarker testing so that clinicians can immediately implement effective treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It was first described in 2018， and only 38 cases have been reported since then. All patients have mutation in the Glutamine-rich protein 1 (QRICH1) gene， yet clinical presentation has a broad spectrum and continues to expand. This report is of a mother and daughter pair with VEBRAS， associated with a new variant of the QRICH1 gene， NM\\_017730.3： c.337C>T； p.(Gln113\\*)， and few previously undescribed phenotypic features.\n\n【2】Case Reports：\n\n【3】We present 2 new cases， a mother and daughter， with novel heterozygous nonsense variant NM\\_017730.3：c.337C>T； p.(Gln113\\*). The daughter was referred to a geneticist at the age of 17 years because of seizures， dys-morphic features， and magnetic resonance imaging suggestive of leukodystrophy. In addition to already described clinical features， she had diffuse infantile hemangiomatosis and occipital balding. She was accompanied by her mother， who shared similar phenotypic features， raising suspicion for a similar genetic condition. Unlike the daugh-ter， the mother never had any significant health problems or concerns and described herself as perfectly healthy.\n\n【4】Genetic testing was performed in both individuals， and a novel pathogenic QRICH1 variant was discovered.\n\n【5】Conclusions：\n\n【6】Considering the novelty of VEBRAS， every new clinical case contributes to the enlargement of the VEBRAS CO-hort， expanding the phenotypical and mutational spectrum， with potential improvement in the further care and observation of probands and their offspring. This report has highlighted the importance of clinical genet-ics in the identification of familial genetic disorders with complex phenotypes.\n\n【7】Keywords： Body Dysmorphic Disorders · Cognitive Dysfunction · Genetic Testing· Genome·\n\n【8】Inheritance Patterns · Phenotype ·QRICH1 Protein， Human\n\n【9】The first cases of intellectual disability combined with dysmor-phic features and de novo heterozygous loss-of-function vari-ants in the Glutamine-rich protein 1 (QRICH1) gene were report-ed in 2018 by Ververi et al， describing 3 unrelated children . The first 3 patients were diagnosed by whole exome sequenc-ing， in which array-based comparative genome hybridization was used to perform high-resolution analysis for copy number abnormalities . All of them shared similar features and syn-dromic phenotype， as well as different loss-of-function muta-tions； therefore， the syndrome was named for its discoverers， Ververi-Brady (VEBRAS) . In the next few years， a few more case studies appeared，broadening the clinical spectrum of this disorder . According to recent studies， the QRICH1 gene is likely to be involved in apoptosis and inflammation， as well as the hypertrophic differentiation required for normal longi-tudinal bone growth . You et al showed the role of QRICH1in maintaining tissue homeostasis during pathological condi-tions such as inflammatory or metabolic disorders . Recently， Kumble et al published a study of 38 cases， summarizing all previously known clinical and genetic information about patho-genic QRICH1 variants . Overall， 35 different pathological variants have been described until now， with most predicted as protein-truncating variants . However only 4 individuals with inherited pathogenic variants have been described late-ly， showing paternal inheritance in 3 cases and 1 of maternal inheritance . This report is of a mother and daughter with VEBRAS， associated with a new variant of the QRICH1 gene， NM\\_017730.3： c.337C>T； p.(Gln113\\*).\n\n【10】Case 1\n\n【11】The 17-year-old female patient was the first and only child of healthy non-consanguineous parents . Her mother gave no history of previous illnesses or substance misuse during pregnancy； however， she had a history of multiple miscarriag-es. The mother did not reported any history of preeclampsia， gestational diabetes， or other complications during pregnan-cy with the proband， who was born prematurely at gestation-a. week 27 by caesarean section. Apgar scores were 2，3，and5 at minute 1， minute 5， and after resuscitation， respective-ly. Her birthweight was 1.139 kg， height 36 cm， and head cir-cumference 25.5 cm. She developed early respiratory distress and was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for mechanical lung ventilation. On day 14 after birth， hemangiomatosis ap-peared. She had proportionally short stature， multiple heman-giomas on the face， neck， and extremities， as well as a small tongue and narrow and high-arched palates. Her further motor and cognitive development were slightly delayed： she started crawling at the age of 6 months， at 12 months of age she was able to stand but only with support， and she started walking at 16 to 18 months of age， approximately. She had had mild right-sided paresis， suspectedly caused by perinatal hypoxic ischemic brain injury. At the age of 13 years， she was referred to a neurologist for the first time， with focal motor seizures in the hands， which progressed to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. She was started on treatment with oxcarbazepine and leveti-racetam； unfortunately， the initial doses were unknown (wascurrently on levetiracetam 1000 mg twice daily)； however her electroencephalogram results worsened with time， showing epileptic encephalopathy and dysfunction with epileptiform elements. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed， and she was referred to a geneticist at the age of 17 years to exclude inherited leucodystrophies.\n\n【12】On the first examination with the geneticist， her height was155 cm， weight was 36 kg， and body mass index was 14.98kg/m. She had mild scoliosis， broad forehead， prominent long nose， hypertelorism， smooth philtrum， thin upper lip， hirsutism， and mild gaze deviation. Also， occipital balding was observed. On neurologic examination， she had mild spastic paresis in her right leg， with initial contractures in the Achilles tendon. She attended elementary school， but had difficulties with concentration and focusing on tasks. During examination，she avoided eye contact but was otherwise cheerful and com-municative. Her mother reported no signs of aggressive behav-ior， although she noted that her daughter could appear eas-ily irritated. She underwent repeated laser surgeries for her hemangiomatosis and did not have any signs of them felt.\n\n【13】Case 2\n\n【14】The patient was a 49-year-old woman with no previous signifi-cant medical history other than multiple miscarriages. She was also the only child of healthy， unrelated parents and cannot re-call any additional information about her birth. However， she remembered that her mother was short-statured， at 155 cm. Similar to her daughter in case 1， this patient had short stat-ure， broad forehead， prominent nose， thin upper lip， and oc-cipital balding . She could make eye contact duringconversation； however， she was easily distracted and incon-sistent answering questions. Considering her history of mis carriages， she had visited a gynecologist， but no objective rea-son for miscarriage was found， according to her.\n\n【15】All things considered， further genetic testing was recommend-ed and offered to both mother and daughter. Also， MRI was performed in both patients， revealing periventricular， sym-metric transverse relaxation time (T2) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintense white matter lesions in both hemispheres in the daughter . In the moth-er， the investigation did not reveal any specific brain matter lesions .\n\n【16】Considering the radiologic findings and clinical presenta-tion， inherited leukodystrophy was suspected and a Blueprint Genetics Leukodystrophy and Leukoencephalopathy panel was performed； however， this analysis did not detect any known disease-causing mutations or novel variants that were con-sidered deleterious. All things considered， we proceeded with whole exome sequencing， which identified a novel heterozygousvariant in the QRICH1 gene， classified as pathogenic accord-ing to the American College of Medical Genetics 2015 crite-ria (the variant results in nonsense change and is predicted to undergo nonsense-mediated decay， and loss-of-function is a well-known disease mechanism for the QRICH1 gene \\[PVS； the variant is not present in gnomAD v2.1.1. orv3.1.1. \\[PM； the variant segregates with the phenotype in the family \\[PP). The variant was segregated in the mother using Sanger se-quencing .\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】VEBRAS remains a rare entity with a large spectrum of patho-genic QRICH1 variants and a phenotypic appearance that continues to expand. Our cases highlight the importance of a clinical geneticist when it comes to diagnosing a patient with multiple organ system involvement and dysmorphic features.\n\n【19】Intellectual disability by itself may not be the reason to seek medical attention and perform additional investigations， as we can see in our patients. Unlike most of the previously re-ported cases， our patients were 17 and 49 years old at first evaluation with a geneticist， despite the premature birth and health problems during infancy in the patient in case 1. Thesummary of preceding cases shows that most were seen dur-ing the first decade of a patient's life. Our case is similar to another case， which was also of maternal inheritance，and in our case， we can speculate about the mother’s cognitive im-pairment as a potential reason for lacking awareness of the child's condition.\n\n【20】The first patients with described de novo variants in the QRICH1gene had a similar phenotype， with intellectual disability， mo-tor and/or language delay， and facial dysmorphism， like our patients . In the next few years， new cases with different pathogenic variants in the QRICH1 gene were discovered and the clinical spectrum has noticeably broadened . In a case series by Lui et al， 2 children with diminished stature and irregular proximal phalangeal growth plates were described， with the authors thereby proposing the theory that heterozy-gous mutation in QRICH1 induces subtle chondrodysplasia . A year later， a group of researchers lead by Fohrenbach pre-sented a case study of 4 more patients and reported more clinical features. such as scoliosis and brain matter abnormal-ities . Recently， a large study by Kumble et al was published， adding clinical and genetical information about another 27 pa-tients with different mutations in the same gene . According to their study， the most common clinical feature is facial dys-morphism， presenting in 92% of all patients； motor and lan-guage delay as well as intellectual disability are also present in two-thirds of described patients； however short stature and low weight， previously supposed to be 2 of the main features， are present in only 32% and 29%，respectively. Our patient in case 1 presented with many of the already reported abnor-malities， such as motor and intellectual delay， scoliosis， facialdysmorphism， short stature， seizures， and structural brain ab-normalities. Nevertheless， during the initial investigation，there were no signs of cardiac or renal involvement， as described in a few other patients . On the other hand， the patient in case 2had only intellectual disability and mild facial dysmorphism and did not consider herself as affected. Therefore， it is important to pay attention and uncover genetic abnormalities leading to developmental and intellectual delays， as it could be only part of the clinical spectrum in cases of QRICH1 pathogenic variants.\n\n【21】The overall function of the QRICH1 gene remains largely un-known， and recent studies support its role in integrating the stress response through maintaining proteostasis in the en-doplasmic reticulum . Considering the gene expression in almost all investigated cases， a tissue-wide spectrum of clin-ical variability in pathologic variants can be expected . Taking into account all available information about pathogen-ic QRICH1 variants， it seems that the disorder can affect not only the musculoskeletal and nervous system but also inter-nal organs such as the heart and kidneys， which is one of the reasons for Kumble et al to suggest using the term“QRICH1-associated neurodevelopmental disorder”.\n\n【22】The reported proband and her mother have some additional， previously undescribed features， including occipital balding， infantile hemangiomatosis， and probable impaired fecundity. Considering the novelty of QRICH1-associated neurodevelop-mental disorder， it seems to be crucial to thoroughly evaluate and investigate every individual with pathogenic QRICH1 vari-ants in order to provide better follow-up care and counseling for affected individuals and families.\n\n【23】Another noteworthy aspect in this case was the gene panel of choice when we suspected an inherited disorder. As can be seen， initial presentation and radiologic features led us in the wrong direction， resulting in a diagnostic delay of at least a few months. It was not lifesaving or an essential amount of time in this case； nevertheless， any clinician should be watchful and avoid any postponements in diagnosis if possible. Today， genetic testing is becoming progressively available； however， it does not always give answers when it comes to rare disor-ders. Therefore， we suggest proceeding with whole exome se-quencing prior to gene panel testing for unknown and poten-tially rare disorders with multiple organ system involvement.\n\n【24】Conclusions\n\n【25】This case highlights multiple diagnostic challenges of rare dis-eases with phenotypic variability. Considering the small num-ber of previously described patients with a QRICHi-associated neurodevelopmental disorder， reporting every single newly discovered case could be beneficial for improvement in fur-ther diagnostic algorithms and treatment strategies. This re-port has also highlighted the importance of clinical genetics in the identification of familial genetic disorders with complex phenotypes. Many questions still need to be answered，espe-cially when it comes to a potential screening scheme. For ex-ample， is renal， cardiac， or genitourinary involvement specif-ic for VEBRAS or it is just a coincidence? Further delineation of genotype and phenotype is required to establish a defi-nite correlation.\n\n【26】We would like to express our gratitude to the whole team of the Child Clinical University Hospital’s Medical Genetic and Prenatal Diagnostic Department， as well as our radiologist， Dr. Aigars Migals， for their contribution and helping with the analysis of the patients'investigations.\n\n【27】We are also very thankful to the team of Blueprint Genetics and clinical geneticist Inta Vasiljeva.\n\n【28】This case was discussed and presented by one of the co-au-thors Vladimirs Krutovs during the 19t International Conference of Students， Young Scientists and Specialists “Actual issues of modern medicine\"， section on neurology， psychiatry， neu-rosurgery， and medical psychology.\n\n【29】This work is generated within the European Reference Network for Rare Malformation Syndromes， Intellectual and Other Neurodevelopmental Disorders (ERN ITHACA).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

This report describes a 4-year-old Polish girl with progressive hearing loss and delayed speech development diagnosed with Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome who was treated with ribo-flavin (vitamin B2) and cochlear implants.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】The case report concerns a girl from Poland who， at the age of 2 years 10 months， developed progressive atypi-cal neurological symptoms of unknown etiology： ataxia of the upper and lower limbs， gait abnormalities， gener-alized muscle weakness， vis ual and hearing problems， and regression of speech development. A karyotype study(whole-exome sequencing) revealed alterations within SLC52A2， leading to the diagnosis of Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome and initiation of high-dose riboflavin treatment. As a 4-year-old child， she presented to the Institute of Physiology and Pathology of Hearing-World Hearing Center in Poland with progressive hear-ing loss and speech regression. Hearing tests revealed bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss with au-ditory neuropathy. Surgical treatment was applied in the form of bilateral cochlear implantation.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】This report shows the importance of genetic testing in infants who present with atypical symptoms or signs. In this case， the diagnosis of Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome resulted in timely correction of the genetic riboflavin (vitamin B2) deficiency and improved hearing following the use of cochlear implants.\n\n【6】Keywords： Polyneuropathies· Auditory Neuropathy·Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere Syndrome · Cochlear Implants·Hearing Loss· SLC52A2 Protein， HumanBrown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome， also called riboflavin trans-porter deficiency (BVVL or RTD)， is a very rare (<1/1000000) progressive neurodegenerative syndrome with polyneuropathic symptoms. The origin of the disease is a mutation of the genes SLC52A2 and SLC52A3， inherited and autosomally recessive， encoding the riboflavin transporters RFVT2 and RFVT3， respec-tively， resulting in impaired intestinal riboflavin transport and reduced riboflavin concentrations in the body . The symp-toms consist of progressive sensorineural hearing loss with auditory neuropathy features， pontobulbar palsy (dysphagia， dysarthria)， muscular weakness， sensory ataxia of the limbs and trunk， vision loss， and respiratory failure . Diagnosis of BVVL is based on genetic testing for mutated SLC52A2 and SLC52A3 genes， but treatment with riboflavin can be started based on suspicion and clinical observations . The prima-ry treatment for BVL syndrome is supplementation with high doses of riboflavin (vitamin B2) .\n\n【7】Riboflavin (vitamin B2) is a water-soluble organic chemical compound composed of ribitol and flavin that is absorbed by active transport in the upper small intestine. Inside cells，ribo-flavin is converted into its bioactive coenzymes： flavin mono-nucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). These are cofactors involved in oxidative phosphorylation and are an essential component in the metabolism of carbohydrates， proteins， and fats .\n\n【8】Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome is caused by an autoso-mal recessive mutation in the SLC52A2 and SLC52A3 genes， which encode the riboflavin transporters RFVT2 and RFVT3 re-spectively . The RFVT3 transporters are located in the small intestine and are responsible for the absorption of vita min B2 from the gastrointestinal tract and resorption in the kidneys， whereas the RFTV2 transporters are responsible for the distribution of vitamin B2 to tissues and are more high-ly expressed in the nervous system . A mutant form of the RFVT3 transporter results in reduced plasma levels of riboflavin， and its coenzyme forms FMN and FAD due to im-paired uptake. Reduced B2 transport leads to impaired mito-chondrial activity and ultrastructural abnormalities .\n\n【9】The motor nerve dysfunction in BVVL caused by RFVT2 defi-ciency is due to abnormal myelin permeability. Thin or leaky myelin results in increased permeability of the myelin sheath， as riboflavin is an important cofactor in myelin synthesis . Such impaired permeability would explain the postsynaptic na-ture of the auditory neuropathy underlying the hearing loss in BVVL syndrome .\n\n【10】To date， more than 100 cases of Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syn-drome have been described . The vast majority of casesare males， and because of the higher disease burden， males with the syndrome die earlier than females. Onset of the dis-ease ranges from infancy to the third decade of life .\n\n【11】The symptom most closely associated with BVVL syndrome is pontobulbar palsy with features of dysarthria and dysphagia， involving of the lower cranial nerves (VII， VIII， IX， X， Xl， and XII， and less commonly upper ll to VI) and motor neurons， the lat-ter causing muscle weakness and sensory ataxia of the limbs and trunk . As the disease progresses， it can lead to irreversible diaphragmatic dysfunction with symptoms of re-spiratory failure. The first symptoms of BVL are sometimes preceded by viral infection， surgery， or trauma .\n\n【12】Before 2010， when the cause of the syndrome was unknown， diagnosis was based on clinical observations . The cur-rent basis for diagnosis is genetic testing for mutated SLC52A2and SLC52A3 genes.\n\n【13】The aim of this study was to present a case of Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome and to describe the method of treating the deep sensorineural hearing loss associated with this syn-drome using cochlear implantsTo date， 9 cases of patients diagnosed with BVL syndrome who were candidates for cochlear implantation have been described in the literature. The mean age at diagnosis was6 years 8 months (SD=5)， the age at which hearing loss was detected ranged from 18 months to 14.5 years (M=7 years 9months，SD=4.66)， and in 6 patients auditory neuropathy was confirmed with no response in an auditory evoked response test with otoemission. Seven patients in this group had used hearing aids， while speech discrimination benefit was limited despite riboflavin therapy. Consequently， 8 patients received cochlear implants， 1 of them bilateral .\n\n【14】Based on data from the available literature， Table 1 lists the patients for whom a decision was made to proceed with a co-chlear implantation. The table includes a comparison of the effects of implantation.\n\n【15】This report is of a 4-year-old Polish girl with progressive hear-ing loss and delayed speech development and a diagnosis of Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome treated with riboflavin(vitamin B2) and cochlear implants.\n\n【16】Case Report\n\n【17】A four-year old girl with a diagnosis of Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome type 2 presented to the Institute of Physiology and Pathology of Hearing- World Hearing Center in Kajetany(Poland) due to progressive hearing loss and poor speech.\n\n【18】Table 1.

Hearing screening at birth was normal. Initially， psychomotor and speech development was normal.\n\n【27】At the age of 2 years 10 months， the parents noticed the child’s first symptoms： clumsiness of movement，stumbling， increased tiredness， and pain in the right knee. Over time， the ailments increased： the child did not want to stand on her feet， fell over， and eventually stopped walking on her own. When sit-ting， she could hardly keep her balance. There was suspicion of hearing loss and deterioration of vision， there was a swal-lowing disorder and coughing when drinking， and she had de-terioration in speech.\n\n【28】Due to symptoms of unclear etiology and the progressive nature of the disease， the patient was repeatedly hospitalized in the Department of Pediatrics and Neurology and the Department of Pediatric Infectious Disease.\n\n【29】Neurological examination revealed features of ataxia in the up-per extremities， dysmetria， a shaky gait with a stagger to the right on a wide base， trunk ataxia， right-sided functional sco-liosis， and lower-limb ataxia with predominance of the right side. Deep reflexes from the upper extremities were present but weak， reflexes from the lower extremities were absent， and abdominal skin reflexes were present but weak.\n\n【30】In addition， the parents noticed problems with visual acuity：myopia， and later horizontal nystagmus.Ophthalmologic ex-amination revealed normal pupil responses to light， and no anterior or posterior eye abnormalities. An evoked visual po-tentials test could not be performed.\n\n【31】After an electromyography neuromuscular conduction study， there was a suspicion of generalized damage to the sensory fibers of the peripheral nerves， primarily of an axonal nature.\n\n【32】Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and cervi-cal and thoracic spine showed no abnormalities apart from a5-mm pineal cyst (a stable lesion with no progression on sub-sequent examination)， while lumbosacral MRI showed thick-ening of the spinal nerve roots with normal signal. The image was primarily consistent with post-inflammatory lesions of the meningeal sac in the L-S segment with ‘holdingin adhesions of the spinal nerve roots.\n\n【33】A lumbar puncture was also performed， which revealed no ce-rebrospinal fluid lesions.\n\n【34】Laboratory tests showed elevated levels of phosphocreatine kinase and aspartate aminotransferase， and slightly elevated urea， sodium， and potassium. PCR analysis searching for vi-ral central nervous system infection was negative. However， assays for metabolic defects by tandem mass spectrometry showed a lowered free carnitine concentration of 5.6 umol/L(normal range， 7.3-86).\n\n【35】During a cardiology examination， echocardiography showed left ventricular enlargement with normal systolic function. The electrocardiogram showed a negative P-wave of 2 mm in the Vi lead (which did not meet the criteria for left atrial hyper-trophy). In contrast， the patient did not show features of dys-pnea， with O，saturation of 98-99%.\n\n【36】A differential diagnosis included genetic and autoimmune causes， encephalomyelitis， Guillain-Barre syndrome， viral in-fection， neuroblastoma tumor， CLN2 disorders， and Newman-Pick type C disease.\n\n【37】In view of the clinical picture and test results， it was decid-ed to institute treatment with pulses of glucocorticosteroids. After the problems worsened， immunoglobulin preparations were administered by infusion， with some improvement ob-served in muscle strength， fine and gross motor skills， and speech.Continuous physical rehabilitation was recommended.\n\n【38】The first genetic test for SCA cerebellar ataxia type 1， 2， or 3 was negative. In the karyotype study performed at MedGen Genetic Clinic， whole-exome sequencing was performed， and variants detected in genes correlated with the patient's symptoms were analyzed (the test was performed at the age of 3 years7 months). In the analyzed panel of genes， changes within the SLC52A2 gene in each allele were detected， with 2 pathogenic changes： a mutation localized within p.Cys159Trp(c.477C>G) and a p.Gly306Arg (c.916G>C)-heterozygous genotype. The re-sults of the genetic test finally provided a diagnosis of Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome at the age of 3 years 9 months， allowing treatment to begin.\n\n【39】The positive genetic diagnosis for this patient was also able to confirm Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome in the patient's younger sister， who was at an earlier stage of the disease. The younger girl exhibited a somewhat atactic gait， a balance disorder， kyphoscoliosis， sensory disturbance， dysarthria， and bilateral hearing loss requiring classic hearing aids. Since be-ginning vitamin B2 supplementation， the hearing loss has not progressed. In the family history， the other siblings -a young-er brother and older children from a previous relationship of the mother - remain healthy. The parents are not related. The exact genetic status of other family members is not known.\n\n【40】After BVVL syndrome was confirmed， riboflavin (vitamin B2) supplementation in large doses was immediately introduced. The disease has not progressed since treatment began. Physical rehabilitation and early developmental support classes have continued.\n\n【41】The patient's hearing loss was first suspected at the age of 3years 3 months. The child asked many questions and required repeated commands. The first result of an auditory evoked potentials test at the age of 3 years 3 months was normal. Recordings from stimulation of the right and left ears showed normal values of latencies and intervals.Another ABR exami-nation 9 months later showed bilateral unresponsiveness for0.5 kHz and click (2-4 kHz). During this period， the patient did not wear hearing aids.\n\n【42】An otolaryngological examination revealed normal eardrums bilaterally， but reduced motor skills in the larynx. The child did not communicate verbally， but shouted and used gestures， body movements， and eye contact. She did not respond to sudden environmental sounds.\n\n【43】Another ABR test was performed，which showed no response bilaterally for 0.5， 1， 2， and 4 kHz. In impedance audiometry， there were As-type tympanograms in the right ear and A-type in the left， and absent stapedius muscle reflexes both ipsilaterally and contralaterally bilaterally. An otoacoustic emission study recorded bilateral responses at all frequencies tested. Bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss with features of auditory neuropathy was found. The patient was qualified for cochlear implantation， initially in the right ear and then in the left ear.\n\n【44】At the age of 4 years 4 months， the team at the Institute of Hearing Physiology and Pathology- World Hearing Center in-serted a Med-El Synchrony cochlear implant according to the PDT procedure in the patient's right ear， followed 7 months later with another in the left. The procedures were per-formed using Skarzyhski's minimally invasive 6-step proce-dure . Standard electrodes were inserted through the round window and encountered little resistance. No compli-cations were reported.\n\n【45】The patient remains under the care of the Institute of Physiology and Pathology of Hearing World Hearing Center and is under-going rehabilitation after cochlear implantation. Audiograms measured 5 months after implantation in the right ear and 4months in the left ear are shown in Figures 1 and 2. Tests were performed using behavioral observation audiometry and visu-al reinforcement audiometry since the patient’s cooperation is limited and responses are difficult to assess. Five months after the implantation to the right ear， the mean postopera-tive free-field thresholds determined by behavioral observa-tion audiometry (average frequency for 0.25， 0.5， 1， 4， and 6kHz) with the speech processor on in the right ear (left ear open) were 74 dB. Four months after the implantation in the left ear， the mean postoperative free-field thresholds deter-mined by behavioral observation audiometry and visual rein-forcement audiometry (average frequency for 0.25，0.5，1，2，4， and 6 kHz) with the speech processor on in the left ear (right ear open) were 63 dB. Intensive auditory training， detection-level listening exercises， and sound differentiation trials have been recommended.\n\n【46】The parents have noted steady progress in their child's audi-tory development.\n\n【47】Discussion\n\n【48】In case of the development of atypical progressive polyneu-ropathy-like neurological symptoms of unknown etiology in a young patient， genetic testing is indicated to detect mu-tations in the SLC52A2 and SLC52A3 genes， confirm Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome， and start riboflavin treatment as soon as possible.\n\n【49】The number of cases of this syndrome in Poland is not known， as there is no publicly available registry of cases of Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome. Only whole-exome genetic testing in the patient described allowed the detection of the SLC52A2 mutation， the correct diagnosis， and targeted treat-ment that stopped the progression of the disease. In the study group， the SLC52A2 mutation was detected in 6 patients and the SLC52A3 mutation in 3.\n\n【50】The mainstay of treatment is supplementation with high dos-es of riboflavin (7 to 70 mg/kg daily) . Vitamin B2 therapy not only halts the progression of the disease but also saves the patient’s life - no patient has died during the follow-up period of riboflavin treatment. Before B2 therapy， the disease was considered potentially fatal . Oral riboflavin supplemen-tation should be started with 10 mg/kg/day in 3 doses for 1month， gradually increasing the dosage by 10 mg/kg/day ev-ery month to a target dose of 50 mg/kg daily in 3 doses .\n\n【51】In some cases， a dose of 70 mg/kg/day is needed to achieve a clinical response， keeping in mind that an overdose of vita-min B2 is not possible with normal renal function， as the ex-cess is excreted in the urine .\n\n【52】One of the first symptoms of BVL syndrome is sensorineural hearing loss， gradually or suddenly progressing to profound au-ditory neuropathy， as shown in Table 1 . Auditory neuropathy can be both pre-and postsynaptic in nature . Fazio-Londe syndrome， which has an identical basis to BVL， differs from the described syndrome only in the absence of au-ditory symptoms， probably due to the earlier development of the condition and a worse prognosis， which， untreated， typi-cally led to death . The time of onset of deafness to sub-sequent symptoms averages 5 years in males and 11 years in females .\n\n【53】Of the 62 BVVL syndrome type 2 patients reported to date， sensorineural hearing loss has been found in 84% of them. After ataxia， hearing loss is the second most common symp-tom of the syndrome . Treatment of hearing loss in BVVL syndrome depends on the degree of impairment and the stage of the underlying disease. The literature shows an im-provement in the clinical picture and hearing level after ribo-flavin therapy. For example， Foley and colleagues successful-ly treated a patient with a dose of 10 mg/kg/day， which wasincreased to 50 mg/kg/day over 12 weeks with evaluation af-ter 3 months . There was a marked improvement in audio-metric tests， from 80 dB at 8 kHz before riboflavin therapy to 40-55 dB at 8 kHz afterwards . Recently， Carey and col-leagues reported hearing improvement in 3 cases after long term (3-6 months) treatment with riboflavin (1-1.5 g/d)， use of hearing aids， and speech therapy \n\n【54】Mutlu et al  described the case of a 6-year-old boy with fea-tures of auditory neuropathy， in whom rapid 20-month supple-mentation with very high doses of riboflavin (750-900 mg/d) resulted in an improvement in hearing threshold. Before ther-apy， thresholds in play audiometry showed a profound degree of hearing loss and no benefit from hearing aids； after therapy the speech recognition threshold rose to 30 dB SPL measured by free-field audiometry in a quiet room. With hearing aids， a speech discrimination score of 84% was achieved.\n\n【55】Unfortunately， the effects of therapy are not good in all cas-es. Supplementation often improves the neurological condi-tion of the patient， but the accompanying hearing loss does not regress and hearing aids do not provide much benefit in speech understanding， as shown in Table 1 . In such cases， cochlear implants are the treatment of choice， and the post-device effects are comparable to auditory neuropa-thy from other etiologies .\n\n【56】The neuropathological basis of hearing loss has been demon-strated by changes， among others， in the auditory pathway(neuronal degeneration in the cochlear nucleus of the brain-stem and astrocytic gliosis in the inferior thalamus). These pa-thologies have been detected in postmortem examinations of the brains of patients with BVVL .\n\n【57】Preliminary functional magnetic resonance imaging studies using intermittent toneburst stimulation at 2 kHz in a patient described by Salmina et al suggest that the central auditory pathways remain intact and provide a positive argument for cochlear implantation to restore hearing .\n\n【58】The patient's case is compared in Table 1 with case reports of BVVL patients qualified for cochlear implantation available in the literature. In 4 cases， the hearing loss preceded the on-set of the other symptoms of the disease； in our patient， the hearing loss joined the motor symptoms after 5 months and was gradually progressive. An interesting case is described by Gedik at al ， in whom a sudden deterioration in speech understanding was noted in the patient's first speech audi-ometry and tonal audiometry study， without a deterioration in hearing thresholds. Bilateral profound sensorineural hear-ing loss was noted in all cases， with auditory neuropathy in 6cases .\n\n【59】Hearing aids were tried in all patients， but unfortunately the benefit was limited， or the hearing aids provided no benefit in speech understanding despite supplementation with high dos-es of riboflavin. Our patient did not wear hearing aids perma-nently， (1 hearing aid fitting was performed， without observing the benefit of hearing aids). Eight out of 9 patients decided to have a cochlear implant， and 1 patient decided not to. Our pa-tient's first cochlear implant was implanted about 1 year af-ter the diagnosis of hearing loss， while the average time from the diagnosis of hearing loss to cochlear implantation in the study group was about 11 years .\n\n【60】The post-implantation effects in our patient were evaluated4 and 5 months after implantation，whereas in the other pa-tients this evaluation was performed at between 3 months and5 years. Different methods were used： free-field audiometry， which showed effects at the level of mild to moderate hear-ing loss for frequencies of 2 and 4 kHz in 3 cases described by Anderson et all  and 1 case described by Sinnathuray et al， and verbal audiometry using the Bench-Kowal-Bamfort sentence test， which showed effects of 0%， 25%， and 94%， respectively， for the cases described by Menzes et al  and Sinnathuray et al . Our patient's post-implantation effects were assessed 4 and 5 months after implantation at the level of progression from profound to moderate hearing loss in the right ear and severe hearing loss in the left ear (averaged for frequencies from 0.25 to 6 kHz， assessed separately for each device). In a free-field test using behavioral observation audi-ometry (BOA) after 5 months after implantation， the average hearing level was 74 dB in the right ear (left ear open). In the left ear， the average hearing level was 63 dB (right ear open)4 months after implantation using behavioral observation au-diometry (BOA) and visual reinforcement audiometry (VRA). The effects of the device after cochlear implantation in the de scribed patient are comparable to the results in patients with auditory neuropathy .\n\n【61】It is difficult to compare of the effects after cochlear implanta-tion in the analyzed group because of the different ages of on-set of hearing loss (pre-，peri-， post-lingual)， the time elapsed between the onset of symptoms and the start of riboflavin therapy and its different dosage， the time of assessment of the effects after implantation， and the use of different meth-ods of assessing the effects after implantation.\n\n【62】Conclusions\n\n【63】This report has highlighted the importance of genetic test-ing in infants who present with atypical symptoms or signs. Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome， despite its extreme rar-ity， should be taken into account during the differential diag-nosis of young patients with progressive auditory neuropathicsymptoms accompanied by ataxia and sternocleidomastoid palsy of unclear etiology. It is then advisable to extend the ge-netic diagnosis to BVVL syndrome.\n\n【64】If Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome is suspected， vitamin B2supplementation should be started immediately， even in the absence of a genetic test result， in order to prevent the possi-ble progression of the disease. Unfortunately， in the vast major-ity of cases， it is not possible to improve the hearing threshold despite the supply of riboflavin， so early therapy is extremely important to preserve the patient's hearing.\n\n【65】In cases of severe or profound hearing loss in BVVL syndrome， especially when the patient does not experience improvement in speech understanding despite the use of hearing aids， the treatment of choice is cochlear implantation. The effects after implantation depend on the stage of the underlying disease， the time of onset of the hearing loss (pre- or postlingual)，and its duration until cochlear implantation， and they are compara-ble to those seen in other postsynaptic auditory neuropathies.\n\n【66】In this case， the diagnosis of Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syn-drome led to timely correction of the genetic riboflavin (vita-min B2) deficiency and improved hearing following cochle-ar implantation.\n\n【67】Patients with this condition require multispecialist care—neu-rological， otolaryngological， and ophthalmological， as well as physiotherapeutic and neurological.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "1f8a79db-fbb2-4724-a852-93f527518ac3", "title": null, "text": "【0】Background：\n\n【1】Parotitis is an inflammation of the parotid gland， which can be caused by factors including infection， radia-tion， and hyposalivation secondary to systemic conditions， such as Sjogren syndrome， rheumatoid arthritis， or medication. Bacterial parotitis is a rare complication that can be observed in patients with hyposalivation. However， it is also observed in elderly and immunocompromised patients. Lack of continuous flushing of sal-ivary glands and their ducts due to decreased salivary flow renders the glands prone to retrograde coloniza-tion with oral microflora. Several microorganisms have been associated with bacterial infections of the parotid glands； Staphylococcus aureus is the most common， accounting for 80% of cases， followed by mixed bacterial communities， including streptococci， anaerobes， and gram-negative bacilli. Bacterial parotitis presents as ten-derness， swelling， and purulent sialorrhea from the salivary gland’s duct. Immediate administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics， based on the results of the patient's culture and sensitivity test， has shown success in treating these cases.\n\n【2】Case Reports： We report 3 cases of chronic suppurative parotitis secondary to dry mouth and due to Sjogren syndrome that did not respond to oral or intravenous antibiotics and was successfully managed using conservative methods， such as the local application of superficial moist heat and periodic pus drainage by manipulating the parotid glands at dental clinics.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】We concluded that conservative approaches， suich as massaging the glands， local application of superficial moist heat， and periodic pus drainage without using antibiotics， should be considered as the first-line management of bacterial infection of the parotid glands.\n\n【5】Keywords： Parotitis · Salivary Glands ·Sjogren’s Syndrome\n\n【6】Parotitis is defined as acute or chronic inflammation of the pa-rotid gland . Factors triggering parotitis can include micro-bial agents (bacterial or viral)， allergies， autoimmune diseases， such as Sjogren syndrome， and genetic/hereditary factors . Acute bacterial parotitis typically presents with a sudden on-set of a firm and tender swelling of the glands with occasional purulent discharge . By contrast， chronic bacterial parotitis(also known as chronic recurrent parotitis \\[CRP\\])， is character-ized by recurrent episodes of pain and swelling of the affect-ed glands， with periods of remission during which the glands are without symptoms . The exact pathogenesis of CRP is not fully understood； however， a combination of the con-stant reduction of salivary flow with retrograde bacterial col-onization from the oral cavity may promote chronic inflamma-tion . Repeated episodes of parotid gland infections lead to progressive acinar destruction， fibrosis， and sialectasia .\n\n【7】Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogenic organ-\n\n【8】ism associated with bacterial sialadenitis； however， streptococ-cal species such as S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes have also been implicated in bacterial sialadenitis . Conservative interventions， including hydration， use of sialagogues， sali-vary gland massage， and stimulation of salivary flow with the use of sugar-free gums or sour candy， are the first steps ad-opted when managing bacterial parotitis . The administra-tion of systemic antibiotics may be necessary in some cases to reduce acute attacks or prevent the recurrence of CRP . Surgical management as excision and drainage of the infected gland might be required in antibiotic-refractory cases or in cas-es with complications. In the present series， we report 3 cases of suppurative-type CRP in patients with Sjogren syndrome， in which conservative management was adopted.\n\n【9】Case 1\n\n【10】An 82-year-old woman with Sjogren syndrome reported non-tender bilateral swelling of the cheeks with draining discharge from both parotid glands. The patient's past medical histo-ry was significant for hypertension， asthma， congestive heart failure， hypercholesterolemia， iron deficiency anemia， gastro-esophageal reflux， depression， and generalized anxiety disor-der， in addition to Sjogren syndrome. The patient had a histo-ry of ovarian cancer， which was successfully managed through surgery and chemotherapy. Her medication list included enal-april， diltiazem， hydrochlorothiazide，cyclosporine ophthalmic drops， ranitidine， sertraline， cevimeline， and ferrous sulfate. Upon manipulation of the glands， a green-yellowish purulent discharge was observed bilaterally from the Stensen's duct， with symptoms being more pronounced in the right gland. The patient had been evaluated by the oral and maxillofacial surgery， otolaryngology， and infectious diseas-es departments for the recurring purulent discharge and was diagnosed with suppurative parotitis. Pus cultures were per-formed on 2 occasions and were shown to contain mixed bac-teria， including S.aureus， Klebsiella pneumoniae， Streptococcusviridines， Enterococcus， Pseudomonas， and Stenotrophomonas.\n\n【11】Previous treatments included courses of intravenous antibi-otic therapy with ceftriaxone and ertapenem in addition to multiple trials of oral antibiotics， such as clindamycin， doxy-cycline， amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin)， trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim)， and ciprofloxacin， either as sin-gle agents or in combination. However， the purulent discharge never resolved， although signs and symptoms of septicemia or systemic complications had not been seen for more than3 years. Therefore， antibiotic therapy was discontinued andfollowed by conservative treatment that included the nightly local application of superficial moist heat， periodic pus drain-age (every 3 months) by manipulating the parotid glands at the oral medicine clinic， and use of sialagogues. The patient was followed up every 3 months for 2 years， and experienced no further episodes of CRP.\n\n【12】Case 2\n\n【13】A 77-year-old woman with Sjogren syndrome reported mild tenderness and discharge from both the parotid glands. Her medical history was significant for bronchiectasis， osteoporo-sis， arthritis， and Raynaud's phenomenon. Her current medica-tions included cevimeline， nifedipine， amlodipine， cyclosporine ophthalmic drops， and multivitamins. Upon gland manipula-tion， a yellowish purulent discharge was observed bilaterally from the Stensen’s duct， with a greater volume of discharge coming from the left side . The patient did not expe-rience salivary gland swelling or systemic complications sec-ondary to bacterial infection. A course of metronidazole and amoxicillin was initially prescribed， but these antibiotics failed to clear up the pus. The patient preferred to manage her symp-toms with periodic manipulation of the parotid gland at the oral medicine clinic， along with the management of hyposal-ivation with cevimeline， moist heat， and home salivary gland massages. At the 3-month follow-up visit， the purulent dis-charge from the parotid glands had ceased， and a clear flow was seen from the Stensen’s duct. The patient continued to use nightly local application of superficial moist heat and sali-vary gland massage， in addition to the use of sialagogues. She was followed up every 3 months for 2 years at the oral med-icine clinic for periodic pus drainage by manipulating the pa-rotid glands， and she experienced no further episodes of CRP.\n\n【14】Case 3\n\n【15】A 47-year-old woman with Sjogren syndrome reported tender-ness and swelling of both parotid glands， predominantly the left gland. Her symptoms were associated with unpleasant purulent discharge from both glands. In addition to Sjogren syndrome， her medical history was remarkable for polymyal-gia rheumatica and autoimmune renal failure. She was being evaluated for renal hypertrophy by a nephrologist and rheu-matologist at that point. Her medications included cevimeline and prednisone. A yellowish discharge was observed bilater-ally from the Stensen’s duct . Signs and symptoms of systemic bacterial infection were neither reported by the patient nor detected on clinical examination. The patient was prescribed a 2-week course of amoxicillin and metronidazole. At the oral medicine clinic， the parotid glands were manipulat-ed. The patient was advised to continue cevimeline， use moist heat， and massage the parotid glands at home. At the 2-week follow-up visit， the purulent discharge was completely resolved. Two months later， the patient reported a recurrence of puru-lent discharge from the left parotid gland with mild tender-ness. The patient preferred conservative management of the symptoms， with periodic manipulation of the parotid gland at the clinic and management of hyposalivation with cevime-line， moist heat， and home massage. At subsequent follow-up visits， the purulent discharge from the gland cleared up with the absence of facial tenderness and systemic infection. She was followed up every 3 months for 2 years for periodic pus drainage by manipulating the parotid glands at the oral med-icine clinic， while maintaining cevimeline use， moist heat ap-plication， and home massage of her salivary glands. No fur-ther episodes of CRP were reported.\n\n【16】Sjogren syndrome is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune dis-ease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration and the destruc-tion of the exocrine glands (salivary and lacrimal glands) . The classic sicca symptoms of dry eyes and dry mouth are the hallmarks of the disease . In Sjogren syndrome， re-duced salivary flow can promote ascending ductal infections through the colonization of the oral bacterial flora， result-ing in secondary parotitis .CRP can be classified into sup-purative and non-suppurative types. Suppurative parotitis is caused by polymicrobial pathogens  and presents with pus discharge from the Stensen’s duct upon applying pressure to the glands . Non-suppurative parotitis is associated with numerous causes， including bacterial， viral， metabolic，ge-netic/hereditary，and autoimmune diseases . CRP is a rare complication of Sjogren syndrome， with only a few cases re-ported in the literature and no established treatment guide-lines . The management of CRP mainly aims to relieve symptoms and prevent further damage to the gland's paren-chyma . The initial treatment should be conservative and may include antibiotics， adequate hydration， and good oral hy-giene practices . The use of antibiotics requires identifica-tion of the involved organisms by culture and sensitivity tests， followed by the administration of the proper antibiotics . In addition， professional gland manipulation， gland home mas-sage， oral sialagogues， and moist heat application are helpful adjunctive methods that may increase salivary flow and facil-itate recovery . Few reports have highlighted the out-comes of the management of secondary CRP with antibiotics in patients with Sjogren syndrome. Sugimoto et al reported the case of a 39-year-old woman with Sjogren syndrome who had several episodes of painful parotid swelling and low-grade fe-ver. The patient was treated with prophylactic antibiotics， and responded successfully to treatment . Stein et al also re-ported the case of a 41-year-old female patient with Sjogren syndrome who had received prophylactic antibiotics for CRP and remained in remission for 4 years .\n\n【17】In this series， and in contrast to the previously mentioned re-ports， we reported 3 cases of patients with Sjogren syndrome who had secondary CRP， for which conservative management approaches， with no antibiotics， successfully alleviated their signs and symptoms without the development of signs of bac-teremia. The first case was given proper antibiotics according to the culture and sensitivity tests， but the infection was refractoryto antibiotics， while the other 2 patients opted not to use anti-biotics. Instead，the patients were managed by receiving peri-odic manipulation of the parotid glands to drain the pus from the opening of the Stensen’s duct at the oral medicine clin-ic， continuing their oral sialagogues to stimulate salivary se-cretion ， and performing daily gland massaging and moist heat application at home. According to the oral medicine clinic protocol， the parotid glands are manipulated from the anterior uppermost part of the sternocleidomastoid muscles and pos-terior to the lower half of the earlobes. Digital pressure con-tinues downwards below the earlobe and upwards to the tra-gus of the ear posterior to the masseter muscles. Patients were instructed to massage the glands at home daily after the local application of superficial moist heat. Patients were placed on a3-month recall system for up to 2 years to ensure the contin-uation of the conservative management regimen， and no CRP recurrence was reported in the 3 cases. In concordance with the cases reported in this series， Patel et al described a case of CRP that persisted even after 3 courses of antibiotics. Specific pressure techniques， applied periodically， along with home care measures， facilitated recovery from the infection . A liter-ature review by Motamed et al found a 50% resolution of CRP symptoms with conservative treatment .\n\n【18】Minor surgical procedures， including sialendoscopy with intra-ductal steroid injection， salivary duct ligation， and tympanic neurectomy should be performed in patients who fail conser-vative approaches and antibiotic therapy . Major surgi-cal approaches， including superficial and total parotidectomy， should be the last resort to resolve severe，recurrent attacks of CRP that failed all the previously mentioned treatment modal-ities. This is mainly owing to the major complications associat-ed with these procedures， such as facial nerve damage， Frey’s syndrome， and unsatisfactory esthetic results .\n\n【19】Conclusions\n\n【20】Conservative management， including the periodic manipula-tion of the parotid glands at the dental clinic and the manage-ment of hyposalivation with either palliative measures， such as rinses for dry mouth， sugar-free gum， and the use of siala-gogues (pilocarpine or cevimeline)， and the home application of moist heat followed by salivary gland massage， may allevi-ate the signs and symptoms of some CRP cases， without the need for antibiotics.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Type A is the most severe phenotype of NPD， with early onset in infancy and unfavorable outcome in early childhood.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】An 11-month-old boy with hepatosplenomegaly elevated liver transaminases， and faltering growth was ad-mitted to our hospital for further assessment of potential liver disease. He had severe generalized muscular hypotonia， muscular hypotrophy， reduced muscular strenght， joint laxity， weak deep tendon reflexes， and se-vere motor developmental delay Leukodystrophy was seen on the brain MRI， and brainstem auditory evoked potentials were characteristic for auditory neuropathy. A chest X-ray showed signs of interstitial lung disease， which was not further evaluated due to absence of respiratory distress. Liver biopsy histopathologic findings were indicative for lipid storage disease. Genetic analysis showed that the patient is a compound heterozygote in the SMPD1 gene-(NM\\_000543.5)： c.573delT p.(Ser192Alafs\\*65)， which was inherited from the mother and c.1267C>T p.(His423Tyr) was inherited from the father. Both variants were previously individually reported in NPD type A and B. The clinical phenotype in our patient was characteristic of NPD type A， with an early onset and a rapidly progresive neurodegeneration. The patient was included in multidisciplinary follow-up， providing him symptomatic treatment and support.\n\n【4】Conclusions： We present a case of NPD type A caused by a rare compound heterozygote mutation in the SMPD1 gene. Most clinical findings and the disease course were typical for NPD type A， except for bilateral auditory neuropathy， which seems to be an uncommon finding in this phenotype and could be underestimated due to infrequent testing for auditory dysfunction.\n\n【5】Keywords： Genetics · Neurodegenerative Diseases· Niemann-Pick Disease， Type A· Rare Diseases·SMPD1 Protein， HumanNiemann-Pick disease (NPD) type A is a lipid storage disor-der caused by acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) deficiency . The ASM lysosomal enzyme deficiency resulting from muta-tions in the SMPD1 gene leads to progressive accumulation of sphingomyelin and consequent damage of multiple or-gans . Type A is the most severe phenotype of NPD (also called infantile neurovisceral form)， which is clinically charac-terized by onset in infancy or early childhood， with failure to thrive， hepatosplenomegaly， and a rapidly progressive neuro-degenerative disorder .\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】An 11-month-old boy presented for gastrointestinal evalua-tion due to elevated liver transaminase levels. He was a sec-ond-born child. His older sibling had a history of vesicoure-teral reflux but was otherwise healthy. Two members on the mother's side of the family had idiopathic transient hyperbil-irubinemia in childhood. The pregnancy was uneventful， pre-natal ultrasound showed polyhydramnion， and the child was born at term with vaginal delivery (birth weight of 3810 g and length 53 cm). The Apgar score was 9/10. Due to mild respi-ratory distress， he needed transient oxygen therapy without ventilatory support. He had mild transient indirect hyperbili-rubinemia， not meeting the criteria for phototherapy.\n\n【8】Faltering growth and motor delay with hypotonia and nystag-mus were identified at 3 months of age. A brain MRI showed delayed myelination and the patient was followed by a pediatric neurologist. One month later， he had an acute gastroenteritis， and higher liver transaminase levels (AST 1.38 mcgkat/l，ref-erence value <0.58 mcgkat/l and ALT 1.08 mcgkat/l，referencevalue <0.74 mcgkat/l) were noted. Gama-GT was normal (0.4mcgkat/l). At the age of 10 months， he had significant hepato-splenomegaly and transaminase levels further increased (AST3.77 mcgkat/l， ALT 4.40 mcgkat/l， gama-GT 0.85 mcgkat/l)； therefore， he was admitted to our Pediatrics'Gastroenterology Department. Liver transaminases were persistently elevated(AST 6.44 mcgkat/l， ALT 5.28 mcgkat/l， gama-GT 0.9 mcgkat/l) and bilirubin levels were normal. He had mild normocytic ane-mia (Hb 101 g/l)， normal platelet count， and normal coagulation. Proteinogram and immunoglobulin levels were normal. He had increased alpha-fetoprotein level (up to 27.2 kU/l)， increased total cholesterol (5.2 mmol/l， reference value <3.9 mmol/l)， de-creased HDL (0.6 mmol/l， reference value>1 mmol/l)， increased LDL (4.9 mmol/l， reference value <2.6 mmol/l)， and increased triglycerides (3.4 mmol/l，reference value <1.7 mmol/l). Celiac disease was excluded， with normal levels of t-TG IgA and IgA. Blood gas analysis， acylcarnitines， plasma amino acids， urine organic acids， and ammonia were normal. Diagnostic tests for liver diseases (alpha-1-antitripsin， ceruloplasmin， EBV and CMV antibodies， hepatitis viruses A， B and C， autoimmune hepatitis antibodies) were all negative. Abdominal ultrasound showed hepatosplenomegaly (liver size 109x104x82 mm， spleen lon-gitudinal size 113 mm) without signs of portal hypertension. The beta-glucosidase level was normal and chitotriosidase was moderately increased (4620 nmol/ml/h， reference range 3-65nmol/ml/h). Liver biopsy was performed. Histological evaluation showed numerous enlarged histiocytes with intracytoplasmic inclusions both in hepatic lobules and portal tracts . Hepatocytes and biliary epithelia appeared swollen， with pale eosinophilic cytoplasm. Ultrastructural analysis showed accu-mulation of concentrically laminated myeloid structures in he-patocytes， Kupffer cells， endothelium， biliary epithelial cells， and fibroblasts ， which combined with histologi-cal findings suggested lipid storage disease. Due to liver bi-opsy results， we conducted targeted clinical and genetic testsfor NPD. Acid sphingomyelinase level was unmeasurably low(<0.4 mcgmol/h/l) and lyso-SM-509 was increased (10.9 ng/ml， reference value <0.01 ng/ml).\n\n【9】For genetic analysis， next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed. We reached 99.9% at least 10x coverage for a patient. The selected core panel for hepatopathy was used for filtering. Genetic analysis showed that patient was com-pound heterozygote in the SMPD1 gene； (NM\\_000543.5)-c.573delT p.(Ser192Alafs\\*65) was inherited from the mother and c.1267C>T p.(His423Tyr) was inherited from the father. Both variants are associated with NPD type A and B. The clin-ical phenotype was consistent with type A NPD. A blood sam-ple for genetic analysis was collected from both parents to de-termine gene carriers for possible further genetic counseling.\n\n【10】During the hospitalization， we observed dysphagia and conse-quent inadequate caloric intake， which was improved with di-etetic counseling. Neurologically， the boy had severe general-ized muscular hypotonia， moderate muscular hypotrophy， and reduced muscular strenght， joint laxity， weak deep tendon re-flexes， and severe motor developmental delay (motor quotient50). Continuous cardiac and respiratory function monitoring in sleep and EEG were normal. Brainstem auditory evoked po-tentials showed auditory neuropathy with bilaterally increased auditory thresholds. Cardiac ultrasound showed mild left ven-tricular hypertrophy， with normal systolic and diastolic func-tion. Vision acuity and fundoscopy were normal. A chest X-ray showed signs of interstitial lung disease， which was not fur-ther investigated due to absence of respiratory distress. The patient was included in multidisciplinary team follow-up for symptomatic treatment and support.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】The primary organs affected in all ASM-deficient patients are the spleen and liver . Hepatosplenomegaly was also the most prominent early clinical finding in our patient. Foam cells are found in various organs and bone marrow of patients with both type A and B NPD， and in our patient numerous foamy histiocytes (Niemann-Pick cells) were found on the liver biop-sy. Quantifying the ASM activity in circulating leukocytes or cultured skin fibroblasts is the standard confirmatory diagnos-tic procedure . ASM activity in our patient was undetectably low (<0.4 mcgmol/h/). ASM is produced from a single gene(SMPD1) located within the chromosomal region 11p15.4， which has a high potential for imprinting. Sequencing of the SMPD1gene can be used for confirming the diagnosis. Over 200 mu-tations of the SMPD1 gene are currently known. Types A and B NPD are inherited as recessive traits， and the degree of clin-ical involvement depends on the type of SMPD1 mutations in-herited and possibly due to inheritance of specific mutationson the maternal versus paternal alleles . Our patient was found to be a compound heterozygote， and genetic analysis showed 2 genetic variants in SMPD1 gene， both already af-filiated to ASM deficiency. This mechanism of inheritance is rarely described in the literature in type A NPD， with 2 Dutch cases reported by Sicora et al in 2003 .\n\n【13】The patient had normal neurodevelopment up to 3 months of age， which is consistent with other reports of NPD cases . Bilateral pyramidal signs with increasing spasticity and loss of deep ten-don reflexes are the most prominent neurologic signs described in the literature. Our patient had diminished deep tendon re-flexes， but spasticity had not evolved by the age of 17 months. Brain imaging showed leukodystrophy， which is also typical for NPD type A according to previous studies . Brainstem au-ditory evoked potentials were distinctive for auditory neuropa-thy. Hearing abnormalities were not yet described in NPD type A， but a study from King et al  reported a prevalent audito-ry dysfunction in patients with NPD type C1， with clinically sig-nificant high-frequency hearing peripheral hearing loss and a progressive course. Ophthalmological exam results in our pa-tient were normal， although it is known that a cherry-red spot is present in the macula in approximately 50% of these infants \n\n【14】A chest X-ray showed signs of interstitial lung disease，which is rare but reported in various types of NPD， most frequent-ly in type B . Niemann-Pick cells accumulate in the alveolar septa， bronchial walls， and pleura， leading to progressive re-strictive lung disease with decreased diffusion capacity and potential oxygen dependence. Our patient had no signs of re-spiratory distress， and continuous monitoring of respiratory function in sleep was normal； therefore， this finding was not further investigated .\n\n【15】Laboratory results showed anemia， dyslipidemia， elevated liver transaminases， and moderately increased chitotriosidase. The platelet count was normal， although thrombocytopenia is the most common finding according to some studies . All ab-normal laboratory results in our patient were previously de-scribed in NPD type A .\n\n【16】Unfortunately， there is no treatment available for NPD type A； therefore，management is symptomatic . Final stages of the disease include loss of spontaneous movement， chronic respi-ratory failure， and recurrent respiratory infections. Life expec-tancy is 1.5-3 years of age . Assessment is complex due to the diverse spectrum of problems.\n\n【17】Conclusions\n\n【18】Our patient， diagnosed with NPD type A， was found to be a compound heterozygote with 2 genetic variants of the SMPD1gene， each inherited from one of the parents. This type of ge-netic inheritance mechanism is rarely described in the lit-erature. Our patient had a typical early disease onset with hepatosplenomegaly， failure to thrive， and progressive neu-rodegeneration. Additionally， brainstem auditory evoked po tentials showed signs of bilateral auditory neuropathy， which seem to be an uncommon finding in this phenotype and could be underestimated due to infrequent testing for auditory dys-function in these patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Individuals with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome are born phenotypically female， without any signs of genital masculinization， despite having a 46， XY karyotype. Case report： We present a case of a 66 year nulliparous female with primary amenorrhea with complaints of bilateral inguinal mass for 5 years and bilateral breast lump for 3 years. The patient developed a sudden increase in the size of a left breast lump. An MRI chest revealed a large 15.4x11.5cm heterogeneous mass in the left breast and a 9.9x6.1 cm lobulated mass in the right breast. MRI abdomen and pelvis revealed soft tissue structures in the bilateral inguinal region near the deep inguinal ring with a blind-ending vaginal tract and absent uterus and ovaries. Karyotyping revealed 46XY. We received specimens of left MRM， right lumpectomy and bilateral inguinal mass. Left MRM measured 32x20x12cm. The cut section showed a large tumour with a variegated appearance. The right lumpectomy showed a tumour with a leaf-like appearance noted. The bilateral inguinal mass measured 5x3x3 cm each， cut section showed yellowish nodules. Histopathological examination reveals malignant phyllodes of the left breast， benign phyllodes of the right breast， and Leydig cell hyperplasia of bilateral testes. Conclusion： This is the first case reported of malignant phyllodes in a case of complete androgen insensitivity syndrome with bilateral Leydig cell hyperplasia of testes.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS malignant phyllodes， CAIS， Leydig cell hyperplasia\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome is a condition that affects sexual development before birth and during puberty.1People with this condition are genetically male but do not re-spond to male hormones. Patients have female external genitalia and female breasts. Still， they do not have a uterus or cervix， so they cannot menstruate. Other signs and symptoms may includeundescended testes and sparse to absent pubic hair. Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome is caused by mutations in the AR gene and is inherited in an X-linked manner. There are 2main types of AIS， which are determined by how much the body is able to use testosterone. Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS)- where testosterone has no effect on sex de-velopment， so the genitals are entirely female partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) - where testosterone has some effect on sex development， so the genitals are often not as ex-pected for boys or girls PAIS is usually noticed at birth because the genitals appear different.\n\n【4】We present a case of a 66 year nulliparous female with primary amenorrhea with complaints of bilateral inguinal mass for 5years and bilateral breast lump for 3 years. The patient devel-oped a sudden increase in the size of the left breast lump for 3months with ulceration of the overlying skin and hemorrhagic nipple discharge. An MRI chest revealed a large 15.4x11.5cm heterogeneous mass in the left breast and a 9.9x6.1 cm lobulated mass in the right breast . MRI abdomen and pelvis revealed soft tissue structures in the bilateral inguinal region resembling testis near the deep inguinal ring with blind ending vaginal tract and absent uterus and ovaries . karyotyp ing revealed 46XY. The hormone levels were studied， showing normal testosterone levels， DHEA， LH and FSH. Left MRM with left axillary dissection was done along with right lumpectomy with bilateral orchidectomy. We received spec-imens of left MRM， right lumpectomy and bilateral inguinal mass.\n\n【5】Left MRM measured 32x20x12cm overlying skin showed ul-ceration. A large tumour measuring 28x19x10 cm on the cut section was noted with a variegated appearance. Right lumpec-tomy measured 10x7x5cm， cut section a grey white tumour with leaf-like appearance was noted. The bilateral inguinal mass measured 5x3x3 cm each， cut section showed yellowish nodules. Histopathologically examined left breast tumour with infiltra-tive margins composed of a stromal proliferation of spindle cells in fascicles and sheets with nuclear pleomorphism. Mitotic activ-ity was 2-3/HPF，with large areas of necrosis and haemorrhage. The ducts were lined by double-layered epithelium.\n\n【6】There were multiple foci of benign phyllodes adjacent to the malignant component. All the resection margins were free of tumours. Left axillary lymph nodes were negative for malig nancy. Hence the diagnosis of malignant phyllodes of the left breast was made. The right breast mass showed characteristic histological features of benign phyllodes. Sections from bilateral testes showed nests of Leydig cells separated by collagenous bands. These Leydig cells were round to polygonal with abun-dant eosinophilic cytoplasm and round central nuclei. Renkie crystal and lipofuscin pigment were also seen. The periphery of the tissue showed atrophic seminiferous tubules with Sertoli cells. No nuclear pleomorphism， abnormal mitosis， or necrosis was noted.  Therefore the diagnosis of bilateral Leydig cell hyperplasia was made. IHC for breast showed diffuse cyto-plasmic positivity for CD34， and on testes， the positive markers were Inhibin and Calretinin. The post-operative period was un-eventful； presently， the patient is receiving radiotherapy for the right breast\n\n【7】This is the first reported case of malignant phyllodes with bilateral Leydig cell hyperplasia in a case of complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) is an AIS con-dition that results in the complete inability of the cell to respond to androgens.\" Individual with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome is born phenotypically female， without any signs of genital masculinization， despite having a 46， XY karyotype. Pa tients with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome are at an increased risk for gonadal germ cell cancer. Residual androgen receptor (AR) activity and abnormal gonadal location influence the survival of atypical germ cells.\n\n【10】The occurrence of germ cell cancer has been reported to be up to 22% in adult patients.Germ cell cancer is very rare in childhood and adolescence 4；however， non-invasive precursor lesions characterized as intratubular germ cell neoplasia， also termed carcinoma in situ of the testis， have been repeatedly described in this age group. Interestingly， the occurrence of intratubular germ cell neoplasia in pediatric patients， at a maxi-mum of 6% of cases， does not reach the frequency of germ cell cancer in adulthood reported in most literature.\n\n【11】Hannema et al.described that residual activity of AR has a positive effect on the development of Wolffian structures and the enlargement of seminiferous tubules during puberty in patients with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.29 Whether residual AR activity also impacts the survival of normal and/or atypical germ cells has not yet been reported.\n\n【12】Phyllodes breast tumour， which accounts for about 0.3-0.5%of all female breast tumours， is extremely rare in men. Very few cases of phyllodes tumour were reported in men. Pathologically， phyllodes tumours are subdivided into three types： benign， bor-derline and malignant according to mitotic frequency， nature of margins， stromal growth， cellularity and atypia. Malignant phyllodes tumours spread via a haematological route mainly to the lung， then to the bone. Phyllodes tumours， even benign types， tend to recur even after complete excision， with a higher tendency for malignant cases. Therefore， wide local excision is the standard of care for phyllodes tumours with or without ad-juvant radiotherapy in malignant lesions. Clinically， phyllodes10115tumours are usually rapidly growing and painless masses.\n\n【13】Based on single case reports in the literature 11-20， gyneco-mastia seems to be associated with the development of male phyllodes tumours， which suggests hormonal aetiology in the pathogenesis of male phyllodes tumor. Gynecomastia is the most common male breast abnormality with various etiologi-cal factors which are potent in affecting the estrogen/androgen imbalance.\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】In conclusion， we present an extremely rare case of complete androgen insensitivity syndrome with malignant phyllodes of the left breast with benign phyllodes of the right breast with Ley-dig cell hyperplasia of bilateral testes. This is the first case to be reported of bilateral breast malignancy in males with androgen insensitivity syndrome with no primary gonadal malignancy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

We discuss the importance of timely diagnosis， the characteristic burn lesions found in bronchoscopy， and the role of bronchoalveolar lavage， which most likely allowed for a rapid recovery with favorable results.\n\n【5】MeSH Keywords： Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid· Bronchoscopy·Respiratory Aspiration of Gastric Contents\n\n【6】Abbreviations： CT - computed tomography； ICU -Intensive Care Unit； SO， (%)-oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter；\n\n【7】RR - respiratory rate； MBP- medium blood pressure\n\n【8】Chemical pneumonitis occurs when aspirated material is toxic to the lungs， which results in more severe irritation than seen in infections. Chemical pneumonitis can also result from the inhalation of substances such as laxative oils (e.g.， mineral oil， castor oil， paraffin oil) and hydrocarbons (e.g.， gasoline， kero-sene， petroleum products) . Upon inhalation， dyspnea sud-denly appears， and coughing starts within minutes or hours. Other symptoms may include fever and a pink and foamy sputum， as well as loss of sensory input. In less severe cases， symptoms of aspiration pneumonia may appear 1 or 2 days following inhalation of the toxic agent .\n\n【9】Mendelson's syndrome is a chemical pneumonitis that results from pulmonary aspiration of >25 mL of stomach acid contents with a pH<2.5 . The clinical manifestation includes hypox-emia，tachypnea， tachycardia， atelectasis， and respiratory dis-tress， with progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome and subsequent pulmonary necrosis. Patients are generally admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Bronchoscopy can show the extent of the airway lesions，and BAL can limit fur-ther progression of the disease. Many patients are severely ill and need ventilatory support .\n\n【10】We report an unusual case of a 15-year-old girl who present-ed with Mendelson’s syndrome after ingestion of a pesticide led to pulmonary aspiration of sterile gastric contents. We discuss the importance of a timely diagnosis， the characteris-tic burn lesions found in bronchoscopy， and the role of bron-choalveolar lavage， which most likely allowed for a rapid re-covery with favorable results.\n\n【11】Case Report\n\n【12】Patient history\n\n【13】A 15-year-old girl was admitted to the Emergency Department1 h afteringestion and inhalation of a powder-based pesticide. Her vital signs were arterial blood pressure 127/77 mmHg， heart rate 166 bpm， and oxygen saturation (SO， pulse oxim-eter) of 98% on room air.\n\n【14】A physical examination revealed a depressible abdomen with slight pain. Suddenly， the patient presented an abundant and transparent aqueous emesis， drooling and foaming at the mouth， and drowsiness， followed by oxygen desaturation of75% as measured by pulse oximeter， tachycardia， diaphore-sis， fasciculations， and sensory deterioration. Supplementary oxygen by mask was administered， and we gave gastric pro-tection， antiemetics， and 125 mg of methylprednisolone， with-out improvement. Atropine was administered upon arrival butit did not result in an immediate favorable clinical response. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were ini-tiated， and the patient was transferred to the ICU. A chest CT scan revealed opacities in both lung bases.\n\n【15】Laboratory test results evidenced leukocyte count： 14 560per mm3 (normal range， 4400 to 11 300 mm)， hemoglobin11.7 g/dL (normal range， 12 to 16 g/dL)， hematocrit 35.3%(normal range， 42% to 50%)， uncompromised renal function， and slight hypokalemia (3.1 meq/L) (normal range， 3.5 to4.5 mEq/l). Liver enzymes were normal.\n\n【16】In the ICU， the patient was placed on invasive mechani-ca. ventilation and vasopressor support and a low dose of Norepinephrine was initiated (0.05 mg/kg/min)， as well as Propofol (1 mg/kg/h) and Fentanyl (0.5 ug/kg/h).\n\n【17】Details of the ingested pesticide\n\n【18】Mocap@G (etoprophos 10%； Certis Group， Singapore) is a po-tent nematicide with insecticidal action； its active substance， etoprophos， is a nonsystemic organophosphorus with contact activity. It has a good penetration capacity and acts by inter-fering with the transmission of nerve impulses through inhi-bition of acetylcholinesterase. Once applied and incorporated into the soil， Mocap G is retained in the substrate and acts by contact in the root development zone by controlling nematodes and insects. Mocap@ contains 10% etoprofos p p， formulated as a granulate (active ingredient： 10%). The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry's name is O-ethyl S， S-dipropy. phosphorodithioate.\n\n【19】Evolution\n\n【20】On Day 1 in the ICU， the patient presented hyper-reactive pu-pils and required invasive ventilatory support. Empirical antibi-otic coverage with ampicillin/sulbactam plus clindamycin was initiated. A chest CT demonstrated opacities in both pulmonary bases . Arterial blood gas (ABG) tests showed respira-tory acidosis， (pH 7.33， PaCO2： 46.4 mmHg， Pa02： 112mmHg， HCO3： 24.0 mmol/L， BE： -1.6 mEq/L， SO。 95.2%) (FiO，70%). Vital signs were as follows： blood pressure 115/68 mmHg， MBP： 84 mmHg， HR： 98 bpm， respiratory rate (RR)： 15 bpm， SO。 95%， and temperature： 36.4°C. Laboratory test results ev-idenced a considerable decrease in leukocytes： 8400 per mm3(normal range， 4400 to 11 300 mm)， Hb： 10.8 g/dL (normal range， 12 to 16 g/dl)， hematocrit： 31.7% (normal range， 42%to 50%)， platelets： 284 000 per mm (normal range， 150 000to 450 000 permm3).\n\n【21】On Day 2， the evolution remained unchanged and bronchos-copy demonstrated multiple burn-type lesions with erosion of the mucosa， redness， hemorrhagic stitches， and bleeding，particularly in the right bronchus. Bronchial lavage was per-formed with physiological saline and bronchioalveolar lavage and brush samples were taken for microbiological studies. Twelve hours after this procedure， the patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation.\n\n【22】On Day 3， vasopressor support was discontinued. Her blood pressure was 122/67 mmHg， HR was 72/min， RR was 20 bpm， and SO， was 99% ((FiO， 40%). Laboratory studies showed a leu-kocyte count of 8000 mm3 (normal range 4400 to 11 300mm)， hemoglobin was 9.8 gr/dL (normal range， 12 to 16 g/dL)，hema-tocrit was 28.9% (normal range， 42% to 50%)， and plateletcount was 287 000 mm3 (normal range， 150 000 to 450 000per mm).\n\n【23】On Day 4， the patient breathed spontaneously on room air(FiO。 0.21)， with good clinical evolution.\n\n【24】On Day 5， microbiological cultures from the BAL were negative and antibiotics were discontinued. The patient was discharged from the ICU and 2 days later was discharged from the hospital.\n\n【25】We report a case of chemical pneumonitis due to acid pul-monary aspiration occurring a few hours after the acciden-tal ingestion and inhalation of an organophosphate pesticide.\n\n【26】Aspiration of large quantities of stomach acid contents in can lead to pulmonary complications， especially chemical burns to the lungs and pneumonitis， as acid contents in lung tissue can trigger edema and alveolar destruction . Lung aspiration of acid gastric contents often results in initial nonsignificant lung damage； however， consistent hypoxemia is present. Tissue damage tends to occur after further lung injury， with alveolar edema， destruction， and damage to the pulmonary surfactant.\n\n【27】In our patient， the neuromuscular symptoms that resulted from organophosphate pesticide toxicity， such as tachycardia， dia-phoresis， and fasciculations， were finally reversed with the ad-ministration of atropine sulfate. However， the chemical lesions caused by pulmonary aspiration resulted in hypoxemia and re-spiratory failure that required mechanical ventilatory support.\n\n【28】The main clinical manifestation of this condition is hypox-emia and respiratory failure that depends upon the extent of aspiration of the gastric contents. Unlike aspiration pneumo-nia， in which the aspirated substance is usually colonized by bacterial pathogens that results in infectious complications， in chemical pneumonitis， the aspirated contents， as report-ed in this case， involved a significant volume of sterile gas-tric acid of approximately 0.3 mL/kg. Mendelson’s syndrome is a chemical injury that results from the aspiration of gastric acid as opposed to aspiration pneumonia caused by the as-piration of oropharyngeal contents that colonize the airway with pathogens， especially bacteria. However， in some cases， these 2 syndromes overlap. Intact defense mechanisms that act in the prevention of aspiration are fundamental - in par-ticular， cough reflex， a normal level of consciousness， and an adequate immune response.\n\n【29】There are some factors that distinguished between chem-ical pneumonitis and aspiration pneumonia in our patient. Bronchoscopic visualization evidenced typical burn injuries， such as ulcerations， congestion， hyperemia， and bleeding. BALand bronchial brushing analyses did not demonstrate bacte-rial growth. Finally， the patient was asymptomatic before the ingestion and presented to the ED in acute illness， with abun-dant emesis of liquid aqueous material， with subsequent de-pression of sensory input， and in respiratory failure. Inhalation of the pesticide to some extent explains our findings， but we recovered acid gastric contents in the BAL.\n\n【30】A rational antibiotic therapy management was initiated， but was discontinued when negative microbiological results were obtained of samples recovered from bronchoalveolar brush-ing and lavage.\n\n【31】Both the IDSA (Infectious Diseases Society of America) and ATS(American Thoracic Society) recommend that patients with gin-givitis and risk of aspiration due to sensory depression should receive a limited antibiotic regimen .\n\n【32】Our patient received high doses of corticosteroids， which might explain her leukocytosis. However， limited data exist on the use of corticosteroids in this therapeutic approach， on short courses of antibiotics， and on aspiration episodes in which the patient develops fever， leukocytosis， and pulmonary infiltrates.\n\n【33】Conclusions\n\n【34】In conclusion， we present a rare case of chemical pneumonitis due to pulmonary aspiration of stomach acid contents after the intake of a pesticide. We discuss the typical burn injuries evidenced through bronchoscopy that led to timely adminis-tration of therapy. Bronchoalveolar lavage allowed for rapid patient recovery with a favorable outcome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Histologically， it involves der-mal arteriolar calcification， subintimal fibrosis， and thrombot-ic occlusion . It is most commonly seen in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis due to abnormal cal-cium phosphorus metabolism and disruption of parathyroid hormone regulation， and is referred to as calcific uremic arte-riopathy (CUA). However， there are few cases reported in the literature in the setting of preserved renal function. The term non uremic calciphylaxis (NUC) is used to refer to these cas-es . We report a rare case of NUC after liver transplantation in a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 65-year-old Caucasian female developed painful skin lesions and ulcerations involving both thighs one month after receiv-ing a liver transplant. Her post-transplantation course was un-eventful except for deconditioning. She initially noticed subcu-taneous nodules a few days after receiving a liver transplant. These nodules progressively increased in size and eventually became painful. The pain was severe enough to limit her ability to ambulate. She also described a subjective feeling of weak-ness. There was no associated fever， chills， chest pain， or dys-pnea. Her past medical history was significant for end stage liver disease secondary to hepatitis C diagnosed 10 years ago during the surgical repair of perforated gastric ulcer. Her liver disease was complicated with HCC， recurrent ascites requir-ing paracentesis， and acute kidney injury with creatinine (Cr) up to 2.9 mg/dL， six weeks prior to transplantation. Her re-nal function eventually improved with Cr down to the range of 0.8-1.1 mg/dL at the time of transplantation. There is nofamily history of autoimmune diseases， liver disease， or renal disease. Her social history is significant for smoking and al-cohol drinking， but she quit both 10 years ago when she was diagnosed with her liver disease. Physical examination was remarkable for muscle wasting along with multiple tender sub-cutaneous nodules involving bilateral medial thighs. Some of those nodules showed overlying violaceous reticular patch-es with central necrotic ulcerations . Her admission medications included mycophenolate 360 mg twice daily， ta-crolimus 3 mg twice daily， prednisone 2.5 mg daily， aspirin 81mg daily， sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim 800-160 mg three times weekly， gabapentin 100 mg twice daily， oxycodone 5 mg as needed， and acyclovir 400 mg twice daily. There was no his-tory of calcium supplementation or warfarin use but she was on weekly ergocalcifero! 50，000 units for almost six months prior to her liver transplantation. Laboratory values are shown in Table 1. They were significant for normal corrected calcium9.2 mg/dL， slightly high phosphorus 4.7 mg/dL， normal para-thyroid hormone 11 pg/mL， and high vitamin D 25 84.2 mg/mL Her Cr level was 0.96 mg/dL with an eGFR of 60 mL/min-ute and blood urea nitrogen of 11 mg/dL. Immune serologies were unremarkable except for positive rheumatoid factor but negative for anti-CCP. Testing for cryoglobulin was negative with normal C3 and C4. Protein C activity and protein S screen were both within normal limits. A biopsy ofthese lesions was eventually done with findings of necrotic leukocytic infiltrate with thrombosis of subcutaneous small caliber subcutane-ous blood vessels along with vascular and adipocytic calcifi-cation， compatible with calciphylaxis. She was started on in-travenous sodium thiosulfate infusions 12.5 mg three times a week. She received wound care along with hyperbaric oxy-gen for a total of five months after which her lesions healed with complete resolution of pain but with significant residu-al scarring .\n\n| Laboratory  | Value  | Reference range  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hemoglobin (g/dl)  | 7.2  | 12.0-15.0  |\n| White blood count(k/ul)  | 4.9  | 4.4-11.0  |\n| Platelet count (k/ul)  | 228  | 150-400  |\n| Creatinine (mg/dl)  | 0.96  | 0.4-1.0  |\n| Blood urea nitrogen (mg/dl)  | 11  | 7.0-25.0  |\n| Potassium (mEg/L)  | 4.5  | 3.5-5.1  |\n| Chloride (mEg/L)  | 101  | 98.0-110.0  |\n| Bicarbonate (mEg/L)  | 24  | 21.0-30.0  |\n| Sodium (mMol/L)  | 137  | 135.0-147.0  |\n| Calcium (mg/dl)  | 8.4  | 8.5-10.6  |\n| Phosphorus (mg/dl)  | 4.7  | 2.0-4.0  |\n| Albumin (g/dl)  | 3.0  | 3.5-5.0  |\n| Vitamin D 25 (ng/ml)  | 84.2  | 30.0-80.0  |\n\n| Laboratory  | Value  | Reference range  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Vitamin D 1，25 (pg/mL)  | 36.1  | 19.9-79.3  |\n| Parathyroid hormone(Pg/ml)  | 11  | 10.0-65.0  |\n| C4 (mg/dl)  | 47  | 10-49  |\n| C3 (mg/dl)  | 159  | 88-200  |\n| Anti-SSA  | Negative  | Negative  |\n| Anti-SSB  | Negative  | Negative  |\n| Anti CCP IgG (IU/ml)  | <0.5  | <5.0  |\n| Rheumatoid factor(IU/mL)  | 31  | <24  |\n| Cryoglobulin (%ppt)  | Negative  | Negative  |\n| SCL70Ab (Units)  | <0.2  | <1.0  |\n| Cardiolipin IgM(gpl/ml)  | 6.6  | <12.5  |\n| Cardiolipin IgG(gpl/ml)  | 3.2  | <15.0  |\n\n【12】Calciphylaxis is a rare vascular disease caused by calcium de-position within the lumen of small and medium sized blood vessels. It was first described in animal models in 1961 by Hans Selye， but was later reported in humans as a syndromeprimarily seen in uremic patients . The etiology is not well understood but is presumed to be related to abnormalities in calcium phosphorus metabolism that precipitate calcifi-cation in the uremic environment， and decrease in the levels of inhibitors of calcification like fetuin-A and matrix Gla pro-tein . However， there are cases reported in the absence ofrenal insufficiency termed NUC. A systemic review published by Nigwegar et al.， identified common risk factors including hyperparathyroidism， connective tissue diseases， alcoholic liv-er disease， and malignancies. Diabetes， preceding corticoste-roid use， chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide， Adriamycin， and fluorouracil)， albumin infusion， blood transfusion， protein C and S deficiency， Crohn's disease， POEMS syndrome， vitamin D deficiency， weight loss， chronic kidney disease (not ESRD)， and osteomalacia treated with nadroparin calcium have also been reported as potential risk factors .\n\n【13】Pathogenesis of NUC is not well understood. Some of the fac-tors like parathyroid hormone， corticosteroids and liver disease are known to increase the expression of RANK ligand and de-crease the expression of osteoprotegerin， thus activating NFKB or degrading the inhibitory protein of NFKB (or a combination of these) resulting in dysregulation of extraskeletal mineraliza-tion . Warfarin has also been linked to the development of NUC by inhibiting vitamin K-dependent carboxylation of matrix Gla protein (MGP). MGP is a mineral-binding extracellular ma-trix protein that is synthesized by vascular smooth muscle， en-dothelium， and chondrocytes. It inhibits calcification of arteries and cartilage in animal models .Another hypothesis links the increased expression of osteopontin to the development of NUC. Osteopontin is secreted by smooth muscle cells that dedifferenti-ate into osteoblast like cells. It is a chemoattractant that is high-ly expressed in skin biopsies of patients with calciphylaxis .\n\n【14】Tissue biopsy remains the gold standard to diagnose calciphy-laxis. Histopathological findings are small to medium vessel calcification with intimal hyperplasia， inflammatory respons-es， endovascular fibrosis， associated panniculitis， extravas-cular calcium deposition， thrombosis， and tissue necrosis .\n\n【15】Wound care is the main stay of calciphylaxis treatment given the extensive tissue necrosis. Sodium thiosulfate has been an essential part of treatment despite the absence of studies that show its effectiveness. Sodium thiosulfate is believed to facil-itate the mobilization of calcium from the affected vessels by enhancing the solubility of calcium deposits in aqueous solu-tion. The beneficial effects of sodium thiosulfate are thought to be partially due to enhanced solubility of calcium deposits in aqueous solution. Initial experiments by Yatzidis demonstrat-ed that calcium thiosulfate is 250， 1，000，3，600， and 100，000times more soluble in aqueous solution than calcium sulfate， citrate， phosphate， and oxalate respectively. Sodium thiosul-fate is also believed to have antioxidant properties that are capable of restoring endothelial function and enhancing en-dothelial nitric oxide production， promoting vasodilation and reducing pain . Hyperbaric oxygen is also used adjunctive to sodium thiosulfate. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy involves breathing 100% oxygen at a pressure of 2-3 times atmospher-ic pressure with many demonstrable effects in wound healingincluding reversal of wound hypoxia， upwards to level of at least 400 mm Hg. Chronic， non-healing wounds such as calci-phylaxis， are often hypoxic with tissue partial pressures ofox-ygen (pO2) less than 40 mm Hg. Tissue hypoxia contributes to poor wound healing as the formation of collagen matrix and angiogenesis are directly related to adequate oxygen tension. In addition to counteracting local wound hypoxia， hyperbaric oxygen also promotes vasoconstriction resulting in decreased edema， inhibiting neutrophil adhesion and subsequent inflam-matory cascade， increasing neutrophil bactericidal activity and augmenting the bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects of certain antibiotics against anaerobic micro-organisms resulting in bet-ter control of wound infections . Treatment of the NUC also includes discontinuation of warfarin and the use of alter-native anticoagulants to alleviate the effect on the inhibitors of calciphylaxis like MGA Protein. Despite these treatments， there is a high mortality rate associated with calciphylaxisThe risk factors identified in our case were mainly liver disease and the steroid received with transplantation. Vitamin D defi-ciency has been reported as a risk factor for NUC， but the role of hypervitaminosis D in our patient was not clear. In theory， disruption of calcium phosphorus metabolism is seen with both high and low vitamin D levels. Though the presence of liver dis-ease has been identified as a common risk factor， the develop-ment of NUC post liver transplant is unusual. Bohorquez et al. reported four cases of CUA post simultaneous liver and kidney transplantation  but this is the first case， to our knowledge， of NUC to develop post liver transplantation. Multidisciplinary approach of treatment is essential. Nephrologists are the most experienced specialist to manage calciphylaxis given its strong association with renal disease. They play an important role in diagnosing， managing and monitoring response to treatment in NUC. Our case showed that successful treatment of NUC is possible with early intervention and aggressive approach de-spite its well-known poor prognosis.\n\n【16】Conclusions\n\n【17】The development of calciphylaxis in non uremic patients is a rare phenomenon that is poorly understood. NUC should be in the differential of skin lesions in the setting of liver disease and should be still considered even after liver transplantation. Skin biopsy should be done to confirm the diagnosis as clini-cal presentation is variable. Traditional management approach with sodium thiosulfate along with wound care and hyperbar-ic oxygen remain the first line oftreatment. Nephrologists are the most qualified in managing these patients despite the ab-sence of renal disease given their experience with CUA. While large controlled prospective studies might not be feasible，ret-rospective studies in large medical centers can potentially be done to look for common precipitating factors.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Seven days later， without interim antiseizure medications， a repeat extended EEG showed resolution of the previously seen interictal findings.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】The clinical and EEG findings were temporally associated with the patient’s use of concentrated THC and may represent a constellation of symptoms of a THC wax toxidrome.

This case also suggests the possibility of THC concentrate itself generating epileptiform discharges， as has previously been described with synthetic cannabinoid use.\n\n【6】Keywords： Cannabis ·Electroencephalography · Marijuana Use ·Seizures\n\n【7】Interictal electroencephalographic (EEG) changes have not been previously described in the setting of the use of highly con-centrated tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)， despite these products being widely available in recent years. Although marijuana is the second most frequently used drug (after alcohol) in ado lescents， with nearly 7% of 12h grade students in the United States reporting daily marijuana use in 2020 per the National Institute on Drug Abuse’s Monitoring the Future study， there is a paucity of research describing EEG findings among adoles-cent cannabis users， and the described effect of THC on seizure threshold has varied widely . Limited data from animal models and human studies of chronic cannabis use describe a disruption in gamma EEG oscillations and thus a potential modulation of underlying network rhythms . Recently， a limited number of case series have described seizure provoca-tion and interictal EEG abnormalities following the use of syn-thetic cannabinoids (eg，“spice\"). The mechanism of these out-comes is unknown but is thought to be potentially related to effects at the cannabinoid type 1 (CB，) receptor . However， to our knowledge， this phenomenon has not been previous-ly described with cannabis “wax，\" which typically refers to a concentrated preparation with far higher amounts of THC (on the order of 50 times greater) than in other formulations .\n\n【8】We report a case of an adolescent with no prior seizure his-tory or known epilepsy risk factors who experienced a gener-alized tonic-clonic seizure after use of cannabis wax. The pa-tient was found to have interictal abnormalities on EEG，which normalized after 7 days of inpatient monitoring without fur-ther marijuana use.\n\n【9】Case Report\n\n【10】A 17-year-old girl with a history of depression and a prior psy-chiatric hospitalization， but no prior personal or family his-tory of seizure， was brought in by her foster mother to the Emergency Department after 4 days of abnormal behavior， including emotional lability， paranoia， and irritability. Several hours before presentation， the patient's foster mother found her unresponsive after a presumed unwitnessed fall， with a brief episode of “eye darting\"and decreased responsiveness with no prodromal symptoms. The patient endorsed daily use of highly concentrated THC marijuana (wax) in the form of vap-ing cartridges， for at least the past 5 days. In the Emergency Department， she had a witnessed 1-min seizure with general-ized tonic-clonic semiology and urinary incontinence. She was subsequently admitted for further evaluation.\n\n【11】The patient had no recent infectious symptoms， fevers， or sick contacts (including exposure to COVID-19). There was no priorhistory of seizure， syncope， or prior head trauma. She was pre-viously diagnosed with depression and had an inpatient psychi-atric hospitalization 6 months prior (for unspecified psychosis)， and was started on olanzapine， which was self-discontinued2 months before presentation. There was a family history of schizophrenia in the patient's father and bipolar disorder in the patient's mother， but no known family history of seizures or neurological disease (although available history was limited by the patient's infrequent contact with her biological family).\n\n【12】On admission， a complete metabolic panel (obtained in the postictal period) was notable for a bicarbonate of 10 mmol/L(attributed to postictal metabolic acidosis)， which resolved on repeat testing； urine pregnancy test and urinalysis were negative. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with and without contrast showed an incidentally enlarged adenohy-pophysis (felt to be clinically noncontributory in consultation with endocrinologists)； results were otherwise unremarkable. An expanded urine toxicology screen was positive for THC Broad-serum analyses to evaluate the patient’s encephalopa-thy were obtained and unremarkable. These analyses includ-ed SARS-CoV2 IgG and IgM， serum B12， HIV， syphilis rapid plasma reagin， thyroid studies， autoimmune encephalopathy panel， thyroglobulin and thyroperoxidase antibodies， antinu-clear antibodies， double-stranded DNA antibody， complement studies， and Sjogren’s antibodies. Multiple cerebrospinal fluid(CSF) studies were obtained and were also unremarkable， in-cluding basic CSF profile， bacterial culture， herpes simplex vi-rus polymerase chain reaction， IgG index， oligoclonal bands， and autoimmune encephalopathy panel.\n\n【13】Extended EEG was performed on admission， and it showed mild diffuse background slowing with occasional bifronto-centrally predominant sharp and spike wave discharges， frequently oc-curring in brief runs without ictal evolution . The pa-tient was not given antiseizure medications and had no further seizures during the admission. Psychiatry evaluated the pa-tient and felt her presentation was most likely related to sub-stance-induced exacerbation of an underlying thought disor-der. She was restarted on olanzapine with some improvement of her mental status， although with ongoing paranoid thought content and disorganized thought process. An extended EEG was repeated 7 days after admission and demonstrated com-plete normalization of the background . The patient was ultimately discharged to an inpatient psychiatric hospital.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】This case report highlights the presence of interictal epilep-tiform abnormalities on EEG following a first lifetime seizure(and another possible seizure within the prior 24 hours)， like-ly provoked by use of high-dose THC wax concentrate， in anadolescent. In this case， we suspect the patient's interictal discharges may have reflected a transient state of increased epileptogenicity following THC concentrate use， and that her diffuse background slowing was a related nonspecific finding reflective of her initial encephalopathy after frequent THC use and during the postictal period. Notably， these findings com-pletely resolved on a repeat study with no interim antiseizure medication administration. The patient had no further seizures during her hospitalization， further supporting the theory that the initial clinical seizure(s) and EEG abnormalities were pro-voked by THC use. As with spice use， the mechanism of this epileptogenicity is not fully understood， although we surmise it could be related to THC's partial agonism of the CB. recep-tor. Further， high-dose THC may lower the seizure threshold by decreasing GABA transmission， as has been previously pro-posed . It is also possible that the patient may have had an underlying seizure tendency， although no historical risk fac-tors suggested this. If the tendency existed， it may still im-ply that use of the THC concentrate lowered the patient’s sei-zure threshold.\n\n【16】Limitations of this case include unknown details about the spe-cific THC (and possible CBD) concentrations in the wax prod-uct used by the patient， as well as an inability to obtain the compound for analysis. Other potential confounding factors in this patient's presentation include her suspected underlyingpsychiatric diagnosis， although this would not be expected to contribute to the epileptiform findings noted on EEG. Finally， while the patient did not receive antiseizure medications in the interim between the 2 EEG studies， it is possible that the olan-zapine started during this time may have affected the back-ground rhythm； however， olanzapine is typically associated with lowering the seizure threshold， and therefore would not be expected to reduce epileptiform discharges .\n\n【17】Conclusions\n\n【18】Amid conflicting evidence surrounding the effect of THC on the seizure threshold， this case supports a previously undescribed effect of high-dose THC concentrate in triggering a provoked seizure in an adolescent . Moreover， as the patient had no prior evidence of an underlying seizure tendency， this case additionally suggests the possibility of THC concentrate itself generating epileptiform discharges， as has been previously de-scribed in several cases of synthetic marijuana use . As the use of THC concentrate， particularly in inhaled or vaped form， has a widely increasing prevalence among adolescents， it should therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis for otherwise unexplained presentations of first lifetime sei-zure in patients of this age group.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Patients with extremely high CK activity with preserved renal function are uncommon. This report describes a case of non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis， with a markedly elevated CK activity， without associated AKI.\n\n【1】Case Report：\n\n【2】A 22-year-old male presented with severe generalized myalgias and darkened urine for 1 week prior to his admission. The patient presented to the Emergency Department with initial CK activity of >40 000 U/L and a serum creatinine level of 0.77 mg/dL. Urinalysis was positive for myoglobinuria. Serum cystatin C confirmed an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 144 mL/min/1.73 m. Several causes of rhabdomyolysis， includingvi-ral infections， Lyme disease， viral hepatitis， hypothyroidism， and cocaine abuse were investigated； however， all were negative. He was given a bolus of 2 liters of normal saline and continued on intravenous normal saline at 250 mL/hour throughout his hospital stay. Urine output remained adequate. We were able to quantify his serum CK activity by dilution method， which revealed a serum CK activity of>150 000 U/L. His CK levels con-sistently trended down with treatment.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】An extremely high CK activity in rhabdomyolysis may lead to AKl. However， preserved kidney function is possible. Young age， no concurrent cocaine use， and adequate oral fluid hydration may prevent AKI in rhabdomyolysis. Physicians need to remain vigilant for cases of rhabdomyolysis that have not yet caused renal compromise.\n\n【5】MeSH Keywords： Acute Kidney Injury · Creatine Kinase · Myoglobinuria·RhabdomyolysisRhabdomyolysis is a medical condition that results from rapid breakdown and dissolution of damaged skeletal muscle fi-bers . This condition is commonly secondary to physical trauma but can also be due to other etiologies such as mus-cle ischemia， toxin exposure， and muscle enzyme disorders . Clinical indicators for rhabdomyolysis include myoglobinuria， fatigue， and myalgia， while laboratory indices for rhabdomy-olysis include elevated creatine kinase (CK)， lactate dehydro-genase (LDH)， and serum myoglobin， and electrolyte imbal-ances such as hyperkalemia .\n\n【6】Patients demonstrate complications from rhabdomyolysis in a myriad of forms such acute kidney injury (AKl)， electrolyte abnormalities， and disseminated intravascular coagulation . While AKl is one of the most common and serious complica-tions， patients with rhabdomyolysis require careful and thor-ough management to prevent it. Treatment modalities focus on AKI prevention by providing aggressive fluid resuscitation with either isotonic normal saline solution or sodium bicar-bonate solution.\n\n【7】It is extremely rare for patients with severely high CK activ-ity to have preserved kidney function. It is generally accept-ed that increasing CK activity in rhabdomyolysis is associated with higher incidence of AKI. This concept was adopted from at least 2 major observational studies of patients with rhab-domyolysis . In these studies， patients with AKl had signif-icantly higher CK activity compared to non-AKl patients with the highest peak CK activity of 55 000 U/L. Here， we present a rare case of a young patient with severe rhabdomyolysis and an exceptionally high CK activity (almost 3 times higher than in these studies) without AKI.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 22-year-old African American male without a significant past medical history presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with upper respiratory tract symptoms for 4 days. He report-ed having rhinorrhea， sore throat， and non-productive cough which worsened from onset to the date of visit. He also en-dorsed subjective fever and generalized “muscle cramping”which had been present for 2 days. He did not receive an in-fluenza vaccination but denied close contact with any sick in-dividuals. On the day he presented to the ED， he noticed that his urine was very dark brown (almost black) without asso-ciated dysuria. He denied prior history of urinary tract infec-tions， abdominal pain， nausea， vomiting， or diarrhea. He stated that he had been hydrating himself well with oral fluids. Initial examination showed body temperature 37.3℃， heart rate 94beats per minute， respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute， bloodpressure 135/72 mmHg， and oxygen saturation 97%. Physical examination was only significant for nasal congestion， and dry oral mucosa. Complete blood count (CBC) suggested viral ill-ness with white blood cell count of 4700/uL， 71% neutrophils，22%lymphocytes， 5.4% monocytes， platelet count 168 000/uL Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) was notable for serum potassium 3.4 mEq/L， serum bicarbonate 30.6 mEq/L， serum creatinine 1.02 mg/dL， aspartate transaminase (AST) 582 U/L， alanine transaminase (ALT) 89 U/L. A computed tomography of abdomen and pelvis was obtained and revealed no liver pa-thology or other intra-abdominal lesions. Given his low sever-ity of symptoms， he was discharged with supportive therapy for viral upper respiratory infection. He was advised to keep hydrated and return to the ED if his symptoms worsened.\n\n【10】Three days after discharge， he returned to the ED complain-ing of worsening generalized muscle pain. He reported that his cough resolved， however， the myalgias had worsened to the point that he had to stay in bed and was being woken up by pain during the night. He stated that his urine appeared dark-er despite adequate hydration at home. He had been taking ibuprofen 800 mg every 8 hours for the pain， along with one dose of 5-mg cyclobenzaprine， without improvement. He de-nied fever， chills， shortness of breath， chest pain， abdominal pain， nausea， vomiting， dysuria， or diarrhea at this time. He works as a waiter at a restaurant and denied history of trau-ma or strenuous exercise. He denied any recent domestic or international travel and did not have any pets. He endorsed to-bacco smoking and recreational marijuana use 5 times a week. He denied alcohol use or other substance abuse. Family his-tory was unremarkable， including history of myopathies. Vital signs： body temperature 37C， heart rate 109 beats per min-ute， respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute， blood pressure152/87 mmHg， and oxygen saturation 100%. Physical exami-nation revealed an obese male (body mass index 33.82 kg/m²) who was not in distress. Most of the examination was unre-markable except for poor skin turgor and tenderness of prox-imal muscles (arms and thighs). The patient was admitted to the hospital for further investigation and management.\n\n【11】Investigations\n\n【12】CBC showed white blood cell count 8700/uL， hemoglobin16.2 g/dL， hematocrit 46.2%， platelet count 180 000/uL CMP showed serum sodium 134 mEg/L serum potassium 4.2 mEa/L serum chloride 98 mEg/L serum bicarbonate 38.8 mEg/L serum creatinine 0.77 mg/dL， blood urea nitrogen 14 mg/dL， serum magnesium 2.3 mg/dL， serum calcium 8.9 mg/dL， serum phos-phate 3.5 mg/dL， AST 2299 U/L， ALT 404 U/L CK>40 000 U/L， and LDH >12 000 U/L. Venous blood gas was sent due to ele-vated serum bicarbonate； pH of 7.411， and pCO， 45.2 mmHg， suggesting chronic metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compen-sation due to intravascular volume contraction. Serum thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH) was insignificantly elevated at5.655 ulU/mL. Urinalysis showed clear， dark amber urine，spe-cific gravity 1.030， pH 6.3+ occult blood， 2+ protein， urine white blood cells 0-5， urine red blood cell 0-5. Daily laboratory re-sults are illustrated in Table 1. With elevation of AST， ALT ac-tivity， an ultrasound of the liver was obtained and was nega-tive for liver pathology. Elevation of AST and ALT activity were thought to be secondary to rhabdomyolysis.\n\n| Admission Day  | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CK (U/L)  | \\>40 000  | \\>40 000  | \\>40 000  | \\>150000\\*  | 123 414\\*  | 80 914  | 55 662\\*  | 32 042\\*  |\n| LDH (U/L)  | \\>12 000  | 一  | 一  | 一  | 一  | 一  | 1609\\*  | 一  |\n| Sodium (mEg/L)  | 134  | 137  | 136  | 134  | 137  | 136  | 136  | 138  |\n| Potassium (mEq/L)  | 4.2  | 4.9  | 4.9  | 4.4  | 4.7  | 4.5  | 4.5  | 3.9  |\n| Chloride (mEq/L)  | 98  | 105  | 104  | 101  | 102  | 100  | 103  | 106  |\n| CO，(mEq/L)  | 38.8  | 35.2  | 30.4  | 27.7  | 28.1  | 27.8  | 27.6  | 25.2  |\n| Blood urea nitrogen(mg/dL)  | 14  | 14  | 13  | 10  | 12  | 14  | 16  | 13  |\n| Creatinine (mg/dL)  | 0.77  | 0.65  | 0.60  | 0.53  | 0.53  | 0.49  | 0.52  | 0.46  |\n| eGFR African American(mL/min/1.73 m²)#  | 204  | 218  | 226  | 237  | 237  | 245  | 239  | 252  |\n| Alkaline phosphatase (U/L)  | 58  | 44  | 43  | 37  | 57  | 61  | 60  | 55  |\n| ALT (U/L)  | 404  | 312  | 378  | 407  | 440  | 461  | 515\\*  | 405  |\n| AST (U/L)  | 2299  | 1695  | 1710  | 1355  | 1123  | 884  | 725  | 465  |\n| Total bilirubin (mg/dL)  | 0.8  | 0.6  | 0.6  | 0.6  | 0.6  | 0.6  | 0.5  | 0.5  |\n| Direct bilirubin (mg/dL)  | 0.2  | 0.1  | 0.1  | 0.1  | 0.1  | 0.1  | 0.1  | 0.1  |\n| Total protein (g/dL)  | 6.4  | 5.1  | 5.3  | 5.1  | 5.2  | 5.5  | 5.2  | 5.3  |\n| Albumin (g/dL)  | 4.1  |  |  | 一  |  | 一  | 一  |  |\n\n【14】\\* Confirmed by dilution； \\* eGFR is calculated using CKD-EPI formula.

Urine drug screen was positive for cannabinoid and tricyclic agent. The latter could be a false positive from the cycloben-zaprine that he took prior to being hospitalized. Troponin I was 0.03 ng/mL (normal range， <0.03 ng/mL). Lyme lgG and IgM were negative. Hepatitis A antibody (HAV-IgM)， hepati-tis B surface antigen (HBsAg)， hepatitis B surface antibody(anti-HBs)， hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc， IgG and IgM)， and hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV) were all negative. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody was negative. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of nasopharyngeal swab forinfluenza A/B virus was negative. Quantitative PCR for cyto-megalovirus (CMV) was <200 IU/mL and for Epstein-bar virus(EBV) was <200 IU/mL Screening anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) by immunofluorescent assay was negative. Serum cystatin C level was sent as patient might have acute kidney injury with normal serum creatinine level. His serum cystatin C level was0.57 mg/L with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of144 mL/min/1.73 m². Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was normal at 6 mm/hour but C-reactive protein (CRP) was slightly elevated at 2.12 mg/dL (normal range， 0 to 1 mg/dl). Blood cultures showed no growth for 5 days. At this point， it was presumed that his rhabdomyolysis might be associated with marijuana abuse or a non-specific viral illness.\n\n【16】Treatment\n\n【17】Patient was initially given 2 liters of normal saline solution followed by a maintenance infusion at 250 mL/hour. He was given 650 mg of acetaminophen every 8 hours as needed for severe myalgias. Fifteen mg ofintravenous ketorolac was giv-en with caution due to concern for renal impairment. He hadbeen afebrile throughout hospital stay. CK activity and basic metabolic panel were followed daily as he was at high risk for acute kidney injury. On day 5 of hospitalization， elevated CK activity was confirmed by dilution method as >150 000 U/L. His myalgia had improved over the course of treatment. He did not require the use of acetaminophen and ketorolac within the 24 hours prior to discharge. His CK activity and LDH level slowly trended down to 32 042 U/L and 1609 U/L，respectively upon discharge. His serum creatinine level was 0.46 mg/dL on discharge.\n\n【18】Outcome and follow-up\n\n【19】Patient was discharged after being hospitalized for 8 days. He was advised to continue taking oral fluid intake and follow up with his primary care physician.\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】This report presented a rare case ofrhabdomyolysis with pre-served kidney function despite an extremely high CK activity. AKl is the most common complication of rhabdomyolysis with an incidence ranging from 10% to 55%. The correlation of CK activity elevation and increased risk of AKI was confirmed by previous meta-analysis . Some studies suggest that in-cidence of AKl is usually low if CK activity on admission is less than 15 000 to 20 000 U/L . In 2003， de Meijer et al. con-ducted a 5-year prospective observation study of 7500 patients who were admitted to intensive care unit and found that only71 patients were diagnosed with severe rhabdomyolysis with CK level >10 000 U/L . In this cohort， AKI occurred in 65%of these patients. Patients with AKl had significantly higher CK activity on admission and peak CK activity. The CK activity on admission and peak CK activity were 47 194+37 600 U/L and 55 366+33 240 U/L， respectively. This study conclud-ed that serum CK activity correlated with the onset of AKI. Similarly， a single-center observational study reported a sig-nificant trend of increasing AKI with increasing CK activity . However， despite previous evidence， there is at least one new-er study that suggests that CK activity does not correlate with occurrence of AKl in rhabdomyolysis. Nonetheless， this study is limited to its single-center design and low initial CK activi-ty on admission .\n\n【22】There are only a few cases of rhabdomyolysis with exception-ally high CK activity reported to date. However， none had pre-served kidney function. Runnstrom et al. reported an unusual case of influenza-induced rhabdomyolysis with peak CK activity of 34 176 U/L and initial serum creatinine of 8.48 mg/dL . Another case was reported by Luckoor et al. This patient presented with combined etiology of rhabdomyolysis with ini-tial CK activity of 701 400 U/L. Unfortunately， this patient had AKI requiring continuous renal replacement therapy. These find-ings emphasize that preserved kidney function with extreme-ly high CK activity is uncommon.\n\n【23】This case presentation adds more information toward the un-derstanding of protective factors for AKl in rhabdomyolysis and serves as a reminder to health care providers that signifi-cant muscle breakdown may occur without renal impairment. Several factors， including self-hydration and low complexity of the etiology leading to rhabdomyolysis were shown to be protective against AKl in rhabdomyolysis . One retrospec-tive cohort showed that the common causes of rhabdomyoly-sis were cocaine， strenuous exercise， and immobilization . This is consistent with a previous case report by Luckoor et al. in which a patient was a cocaine user with Legionella co-infec-tion. We believe our patient had the following protective fac-tors against AKI： younger age， African American race， no his-tory of cocaine use， and adequate oral hydration. With the same serum creatinine level， patients of African American race have higher eGFR compared to other races . Further ob-servational studies are needed to confirm the protective fac-tors against AKI in rhabdomyolysis patients.\n\n【24】Conclusions\n\n【25】Extremely high CK activity in rhabdomyolysis can lead to AKI. However， preserved kidney function is possible in such a pa-tient. Young age， no concurrent cocaine use， and adequate oral fluid hydration may prevent AKl in rhabdomyolysis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Also， we recommend sending a hematology referral in nontraumatic subdu-ral hematoma. There is no specific treatment or algorithm based on previous research， although from observed data and based on information from the American Heart Association， it is reasonable to perform craniectomy in extra-axial collections of more than 1 cm with midline shift to avoid mortality， as reaching a diagnosis would take too much time.\n\n【5】Keywords： Decompressive Craniectomy·Hematoma， Subdural·Leukemia\n\n【6】Chronic subdural hematoma is defined as a collection in the subdural space for more than 3 weeks . The incidence rang-es from 1 to 20 per 100 000/year， with increased prevalence in the elderly， in males， and with use of anticoagulants or an-tiplatelets . The initial symptoms include headache， dizzi-ness， and motor and sensory deficits . Surgical treatment including evacuation+/- craniectomy is done when thickness is more than 10 mm and there is a midline shift. There is high mortality if treatment is performed for patients over age 70years and for comatose patients with absent pupillary reflex bilaterally and with pathology in the dominant side .\n\n【7】Chronic myeloid leukemia has been linked to spontaneous subdural hematoma， with the highest reported cases of 39patients in Korea， but no management is mentioned in that paper . Chronic myelogenous leukemia has 3 phases： indo-lent， accelerated， and terminal blast crisis that is like leuke-mia. The most common symptoms are weight loss， abdomi-nal pain in the left upper quadrant， with lab results showing leukocytosis .\n\n【8】There are few reported cases of patients who are medically free with no use of anticoagulants， diagnosed as having sub-dural hematoma， and then later discovered to have chronic myelogenous leukemia . Evidence shows that thrombo-cytopenia <50 000 is associated with higher morbidity and mortality and requires aggressive platelets transfusion .\n\n【9】We report the case of a patient with leukocytosis who then had double evacuation with craniectomy for subdural hema-toma and was later found to have chronic myelogenous leu-kemia postoperatively determined by lab results.\n\n【10】Case Report\n\n【11】We report the case of a 45-year-old man known to have hy-pertension and diabetes mellitus type 2， on aspirin weekly (as history has been obtained from children)， who was referred from another hospital with a history of sudden-onset severe headache not related to trauma. There was no previous histo-ry of convulsions or vomiting. The level of consciousness grad-ually dropped to Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 9/15 when he was rushed to the hospital. A report of computed tomogra-phy (CT) brain from another hospital showed a left-side sub-dural hematoma with midline shift.\n\n【12】There was 7-h time interval between onset of symptoms and presentation to our emergency department. Physical exam-ination in our emergency department showed that the pa-tient was intubated on a mechanical ventilator， on fentanyldeveloped 1 attack of fever， so he was started on vancomy-cin， cefepime， and caspofungin. Cultures showed pansensi-tive staph and candida in the sputum. The hematology team was highly suspicious of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)， with blood film showing eosinophilia； therefore， he was start-ed on hydroxyurea 1 g daily oral dose， and a recommendation of PCR ABL gene to be done in a high-level center.\n\n【13】Table 1.

Repeated CT brain in our hospital ， showed left-sided extra-axi-al hyperdensity 2 cm in maximum thickness with mass effect and midline shift 1.4 cm， left uncal herniation， and effacement of cortical sulci and left lateral ventricle.\n\n【17】He underwent left-sided acute subdural hematoma evacu-ation with a big question mark incision on the left side. He was kept in supine position， head tilted to the right side， with left shoulder support. The hair was shaved and the skin was cleaned with antiseptic and draped. A big question mark in-cision was made， the myocutaneous flap was elevated， and a large bone flap was made with the aim of possible decompres-sive craniectomy. Then， the dura was opened in a C-shaped fashion with base directed to base， and the hematoma was evacuated. The brain looked healthy and lax， and good he-mostasis was achieved with Surgicel， fibrillary Surgicel， and TachoSil. In the end， the dura was closed in watertight fash-ion， the bone flap was returned as brain was lax， and it was fixed with mini-plates and screws. The scalp was closed in 2layers， using closed suction， with estimated blood loss 700mL and duration of the procedure 240 min. He was intubat-ed and sedated， and his pupils were 2 mm and not reactive.\n\n【18】A repeated CT brain after 6 h ， showed left- sided craniotomy with pneumocephalus， subgaleal hematoma， and redemonstration of subdural hematoma with midline shift 17mm and uncal herniation.\n\n【19】He was pushed to the operating room to undergo left subdu-ral hematoma evacuation with craniectomy for recollection of a left-sided acute subdural hematoma. The same question mark incision in the scalp was used， and an old appendecto-my incision was used with slight elongation accommodate the bone flap. In the first stage，the patient was kept in supine po-sition with head tilted to the right side with left shoulder sup-port， and the skin was cleaned with antiseptic and draped. The previous question mark incision in the scalp was reopened， a large subgaleal hematoma was evacuated， and the bone flap was removed. A huge extra-axial hematoma was evacuated， the dura was opened， and there was no recollection of sub-dural hematoma. The brain was found to be visible and pul-sating well， and the dura was left open. Long-term hemosta-sis was needed using Surgicel， fibrillary Surgicel， and TachoSil，and the patient received a perioperative blood transfusion of6 units platelets and 2 units packed red blood cells (PRBC) as Hb dropped from 11 to 6， as we suspected coagulopathy as a case of the recollecting hematoma. In the second stage， the abdominal skin incision was made， a subcutaneous pock-et was created， and the bone flap was kept within. The skin was closed in layers and closed suction was inserted. The es timated blood loss was 150-200 mL and duration of the pro-cedure 120 min. Histopathology of dura mater was not done.\n\n【20】The patient was sedated， intubated， pupils 2 mm， equal and reactive. He was on antiseizure medication： phenytoin 100 mg3 times daily. The hematology team consulted and the inten-sive care unit (ICU) were involved.\n\n【21】Laboratory values on day 1 after the second evacuation showed marked leukocytosis， anemia， thrombocytopenia， and deranged electrolytes . A CT brain showed status postoperative evacuation and left skull craniectomy ， significant im-provement of left extra-axial hematoma， with improvement of midline shift from 17 mm to 7 mm.\n\n【22】The patient's GCS started to improve； it was GCS E2V1M3 on day 2 postoperatively and GCS E4V1M6 at the end of 2 weeks postoperatively. In the first week， there was wound oozing， so the suture was taken at the site of the drain. The patient\n\n【23】Table 2. Laboratory values on Day 1 after the second evacuation.

There was mild oozing of serosangui-nous fluid upon removing the suture， which was controlled by compression and dressing. A repeat CT brain  showed significant interval improvement and newly-seen left tempo-roparietal extra-axial collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at-tenuation， with maximum thickness 3.1 cm.\n\n【26】One month postoperatively， the patient returned to his base-line GCS 15/15 and was extubated， with residual weakness. He sustained residual right-side weakness， spasticity， and left foot drop. The scalp flap was soft， the abdominal wound was malodorous and fluctuating， and the dressing was soaked. Assubdural hematoma and decompressive craniectomy. Description： significant improvement of left extra-axial hematoma (pointed in the image) with improvement of midline shift from 17 mm to 7 mm.\n\n【27】a result， evacuation of infected collection of the previous sur-gical site in the anterior abdominal wall was achieved with discarding the buried abdominal flap. The patient was kept in supine position and the surgical site was cleaned with antisep-tic and draped. The previous incision was opened and a huge amount of slightly malodorous hematoma was removed. The cavity was well cleaned with frequent irrigation with saline and betadine， and good hemostasis was achieved. The skin was closed with single-layer mattress suturing， and closed suction was placed. There was minimal blood loss and the duration of the procedure was 30 min. Cultures were sent， and lab re-sults showed a return to baseline .\n\n【28】Discussion\n\n【29】Subdural hematoma usually presents with headaches and decreased level of consciousness. They are treated surgical-ly in severe mass effect and midline shift， and they are usual-ly caused by trauma . Risk factors include use of antiplate-lets， male sex， and elderly . There are 52 reported cases that link chronic myelogenous leukemia with subdural hematoma，with 47 cases of subdural hematoma development in diag-nosed leukemic patients . These cases reported leuko-cytosis upon admission .\n\n【30】However， to the best of our knowledge， there are no reported cases of return of normal WBC count with hydroxyurea. The mortality rate of such cases is 70-100%， with the postulat-ed etiology that the bundle of WBC causes endothelial injury， hypoxia， and hemorrhage to the underlying structure . There has been 100% mortality reported in age groups 60-70years ， while 0% mortality is reported in patients 40-55years . Hematologists recommended in the literature to treat the patients conservatively in the setting of thrombocy-topenia， and if surgical management is recommended， they recommend using platelets in emergency settings . We faced some surgical challenges that included uncontrolled oozing， which was managed by electrocautery， antiplatelets， and des-mopressin. The decision to perform dural opening was made and decompressive craniectomy was done. A similar case re-ported emergency double-surgery craniotomy followed by cra-niectomy managed successfully. The authors found a green-ish-red tumor-like mass with brain swelling intraoperatively， with no reported use of hemostatic agents intraoperatively. They kept the patient postoperatively on mannitol and furose-mide， with reported improvement of GCS to 13 after the sec-ond procedure . Our patient was treated with hydroxyureaafter evacuation of the acute subdural hematoma that caused a drop in GCS， in comparison to a case report of chronic sub-dural hematoma with presentation of headache， but with no thrombocytopenia， that was managed with Gleevec only .\n\n【31】Table 3.

It is also important to look for a differential diagnosis and to keep chron-ic myelogenous leukemia in mind in patients with leukocyto-sis. There is no specific treatment or algorithm based on pre-vious research， although from observed data  and from the American Heart Association， it is favorable to go to crani-ectomy in cases with extra-axial collections of more than 1 cm with midline shift  to avoid mortality， as reaching a diagno-sis would take too much time. Also， we stress the importance of blood products， especially in management of oozing， in the operation room and to involve the ICU staff in the planning.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The manifested color was formed from the metabolism of tryptophan in the gastrointestinal tract yielding the end product of indigo and indirubin， forming a purple hue. This investigation reported PUBS in an elderly woman with an indwelling catheter and faecal incontinence due to spinal cord injury which， to our knowledge， was the first case in our secondary regential hospital， Bangli Medika Canti Hospital. The patient underwent urinary catheter replacement and received intravenous ceftriaxone and oral ciprofloxacin， following which the urine turned clear yellow， and the patient was discharged. We present a case and literature review of this peculiar phenomenon.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS purple urine bag syndrome， PUBS， urinary tract infection， indigo， tryptophan\n\n【2】Background\n\n【3】Purple urine bag syndrome (PUBS) is a peculiar phenomenon related to a rare manifestation of urinary tract infection (UTI). The condition is characterised by the purple discoloration of the urine bag following long-term urinary catheterisation. This clinical entity was first described in 1978 by Barlow and Dick-son. Nevertheless， in the nineteenth century， this entity was believed to be experienced by a famous historical figure (the English King George III). The prevalence of PUBS has been reported sporadically in different series from various parts of the world， ranging from 8.3% to 42.1% in hospitalised patients with a long-term indwelling catheter and in one study， 27% of el-derly patients with dementia in a geriatric hospital who required urinary catheterisation developed PUBS.\n\n【4】Case report\n\n【5】A 60-year-old bed-ridden Balinese woman was admitted to the emergency department with lower section abdominal pain ±\n\n【6】12 hours before admission. The patient complained of sudden dull pain in her lower abdominal section with a VAS score of4-5/10. Her son also noticed a discoloration of her urine bag that had changed color to purple . The patient was known to have neurologic bladder and faecal incontinence due to her history of spinal cord injury type ASIA B classification. She had been using a urinary catheter and diapers for two months. Further past medical history (diabetes mellitus， hypertension， cardiac disorders， asthma， stroke， past surgery history， allergies， and routine drug(s) consumptions) was remarkable.\n\n【7】At the consultation， vital signs were within normal limit， and abdominal examination of the patient's bladder was per-formed to ensure that it was empty， it was found that the bladder was palpable with suprapubic pain. Nevertheless， no mass was found. No abnormalities were found in the flank region. Fur-ther physical， neurologic examination revealed motor weakness(paraparesis) in both lower extremities. The patient had a 16-Fr indwelling catheter and purple urine discoloration.\n\n【8】Laboratory blood tests， including complete blood count，renal function tests， random blood glucose， electrolyte levels， and urinalysis， were performed with follow-up results . Urine and blood culture was performed for aerobic bacteria， but no growth of pathogenic bacteria was found. A diagnosis of complicated UTI was established. The patient was treated with Ceftriaxone 1 gram and Ciprofloxacin 200 milligram twice daily for five days， and a new urinary catheter replacement was placed. After receiving antibiotic treatment， her urine bag gradually turned yellow and clear . The courseof illness is shown as a timeline in Figure 3.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Purple urine bag syndrome (PUBS) is a rare alarming and dis-tressing phenomenon recognised by purple urine discoloration. Numerous factors have been associated with PUBS cases. Following our literature review， geriatric， female， chronic catheterisation， constipation， dementia， bed-ridden situation， in-stitutionalisation， increased dietary tryptophan， end-stage renal disease (ESRD)， dehydration， use of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) urinary catheter or bag， recurrent UTI， high urinary bacterial load， and alkaline urine pH were identified as associated pre-disposing factors of PUBS. Geriatrics have a higher risk of UTI due to the direct effects of aging on the bladder， including de-creased capacity， reduced contractility， increased hyperactivity， and increased residual urine. Additional factors such as uri-nary incontinence， cystocele， diabetes mellitus， and reduced urination frequencies and fluid intake increase the susceptibil-ity to infections. Female urinary tract anatomy predisposes them to UTIs also it was found that the female-to-male ratio was1.5：1. Chronic catheterisation increases an individual risk of UTIs， increasing their likelihood of being infected by the rarer bacteria， which can go on to cause PUBS. Constipation has beenconsidered as one of the most common symptoms in PUBS af-fected individuals this is based due to decreased gut motility and prolonged transit time and may be associated with bacte-rial overgrowth and increased bacterial exposure in the bowel lumen leading to more substrate being metabolised to indole and increased absorption. Additionally， patients suffering from constipation usually use laxatives or long-term application of suppository Bisacodyl which may cause damage to colorectal mucosa and changes of normal intestinal microbiota， leading to the preferential growth of certain bacterial species producing indigo as a by-product. Dementia， bed-ridden situation， and institutionalisation cater to the additional attention as it poses an incremental risk of UTI due to the possible needs or high odds of long-term urinary catheterisation. Chronic catheterisation， especially when precautionary hygiene measures are not taken into account， predisposes to UTI that may lead to PUBS.\n\n【11】Increased dietary tryptophan increases the amount of sub-strate for the PUBS-causing bacteria to metabolise and produce indigo (blue) and indirubin (red) pigments producing a combi-nation of purple color. ESRD heightened the risk of PUBS due to the clearance impairment of indoxyl sulfate leading to urinary bacteria having more substrate to produce the red and blue pig-ments. Dehydration increases the serum concentration of indigo and indirubin， favouring the likelihood of purple urine. The use of a PVC-containing catheter bag formed the purple color observed， due to indications exposure to air they are oxidised to form both indigo and indirubin and react with the plastics forming the purple color. Without this reaction between in-digo/indirubin and the PVC bag， the urine may be dark brown or turbid. High urinary bacterial loads will increase the availability of bacterial sulfatase and phosphatase， which con-vert indoxyl sulfate to indigo and indirubin. Lastly， alkaline urine pH facilitates indoxyl sulfate production to indigo and indirubin， although in some case reports have been reported the formation in acidic urine pH. Mnemonic of predisposing factors was developed known as \"The ABCDEFGH Rule\" . Our case highlighted the predisposing factors of a bed-ridden geriatric female patient with an indwelling catheter and PVC urinary bag， and faecal incontinence leading to the developmentof PUBS.\n\n| Parameter  | Result  | Units  | Normal Range  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hematology  |  |  |  |\n| Full Blood Count  |  |  |  |\n| Haemoglobin  | 15.6  | g/dL  | 12-16  |\n| Hematocrit  | 44.4  | %  | 37-47  |\n| Erythrocyte (RBC)  | 5.44  | 10^6/uL  | 4-6  |\n| Leukocyte  | 10.2  | 10^3/uL  | 5-10  |\n| Differential Count  |  |  |  |\n| Basophil  | 0  | %  | 0-1  |\n| Eosinophil  | 0  | %  | 1-3  |\n| Neutrophil  | 65.0  | %  | 50-70  |\n| Lymphocyte  | 33.8  | %  | 25-40  |\n| Monocyte  | 1.2  | %  | 2-8  |\n| Platelet  | 265  | 10^3/uL  | 150-400  |\n| MCV，MCH，MCHC  |  |  |  |\n| MCV  | 81.6  | fL  | 88-99  |\n| MCH  | 28.7  | Pg  | 31-37  |\n| MCHC  | 35.1  | g/L  | 27-31  |\n| BIOCHEMISTRY  |  |  |  |\n| Random Blood Glucose  | 71  | mg/dL  | Max 150  |\n| Prandial Blood Glucose  | 107  | mg/dL  | 75-115  |\n| 2 Hour Post-Prandial Blood Glucose  | 116  | mg/dL  | Max 150  |\n| HbA1c  | 4，9  | %  | 4.0-5.6  |\n| Ureum  | 30.1  | mg/dL  | 11.0-37.0  |\n| Creatinine  | 0.82  | mg/dL  | 0.50-1.20  |\n\n【13】A thorough literature review revealed that the most common bacteria associated with PUBS encompassed of Klebsiella pneu-moniae， Escherichia coli， Providencia species (including Prov-idencia stuartii， Providencia rettgeri)， Proteus species (includ-ing Proteus mirabilis， Proteus vulgaris)， Enterococcus species(including Enterococcus avium， Enterococcus faecalis)， Enter-obacter species (including Enterobacter aerogenes， Enterobacter agglomerans， Enterobacter cloacae)， Morganella morganii， and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Less commonly reported associa-tions include Citrobacter spp. (including Citrobacter frundii， Citrobacter diversus， Citrobacter koseri)， Staphylococcus spp.， Streptococcus spp.， and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus au-reus. Nevertheless， contamination/no growth has been reported. In our case， urine and blood culture revealed no growth， which may be contributed by the delay of sample collection prior to antibiotic administration due to the initial patient's refusal.\n\n【14】The pathophysiological basis of the purple urine remained controversial. It is hypothesised that its basis comes from themixture of indigo (blue) and indirubin (red) resulting from a chain reaction of tryptophan metabolism. Tryptophan is an a-amino acid used in the biosynthesis of proteins where it is transferred in the intestine in order to be deaminated into indole by gut microbiota. Indole is rapidly transported by the portal cir-culation and is conjugated by the hepatic enzymes (cytochrome P4502E1 \\[CYP2E)， forming the conjugate indoxyl sulfate for secretion into urine by the kidneys. This conjugate is converted into indoxyl sulfate by sulfatases and phosphatases produced by several bacteria to indoxyl in the kidney. In alkaline urine， especially， indoxyl is oxidised into indigo and indirubin. When little oxygen is present， there is a tendency for indoxyl to form P into isatin and combined further with the indoxyl residue to produce indirubin. Precipitations of both the indigo and indiru-bin pigments and reaction with the synthetic materials of the catheter and urine bag lead to the formation of an alarming purple discoloration .\n\n【15】Diagnosis of PUBS can be made visually； nevertheless， a clinician unaware of this phenomenon may misdiagnose it.

Acknowledging the different etiologies in urine discoloration will lead to a further understanding of the treatment approach for the other etiologies reducing the risk of improper management of patients or administration of drugs with several side effects. Development of the \"Oxford Urine Chart\"  has simplified and serves its usefulness as a quick reference tool for health care professionals encountering unusual colors of urine to establish potential causes. Aggres-sive investigation and workup are considered in the condition of symptomatic patients suggestive of an underlying UTI.\n\n【20】Management of PUBS comprised of 1) eradication of UTI， 2) improvement of urologic sanitation measures (including replace-ment of urinary catheter)， 3) management of underlying risk factors (such as constipation， ESRD， dehydration， etc.). Eradica-tion of UTI involved several mechanisms such as 1) eradication of the offending organisms through the prescription of antibi-otic(s)， 2) changing the environment of the bladder microbiome， and 3) strengthening of the host. Firstly， antibiotics that may be considered is ciprofloxacin or other gram-negative bacte-ria effective antibiotics (such as piperacillin/tazobactam， ticar-cillin/clavulanate， ampicillin/sulbactam， ceftazidime， cefepime， levofloxacin， norfloxacin， moxifloxacin， meropenem and/or er-tapenem). Based on clinical judgment， antibiotics can be initiated before the results of urinalysis and urine culture are available. Intravenous antibiotics may be considered in instances such as the persistence of PUBS or the patient is immunocompro-misedSecondly， changing the bladder microbiome's environment can be achieved through the involvement of prophylactic ad-ministration of probiotics， acidification of the urine (through the use of methenamine hippurate) or bacterial interference(replacement of the colonised bacteria with different bacteria). Thirdly， strengthening of the host can be attained through mini-malisation of urinary retention and optimisation of voiding by correcting the anatomical problem(s) (such as urethral stricture)， removal of infection source (such as bladder stones)， prescription of pre-biotics and pro-biotics， reduction of bacterial adhesion to the bladder wall with agents such as cranberry extract and D-mannose， and strengthening of individual's overall immune system. Improvement of urologic sanitation measure involved the replacement of long-term indwelling catheter and drainage bags regularly in preventing recurrence and compli-cation such as Fournier’s gangrene which requires surgical de-bridement. Alternatively， nonplastic catheter drainage bags can be considered\n\n【21】On the other hand， treatment for asymptomatic patients should be aimed at the underlying medical problem rather than the PUBS. In conclusion， there are no guidelines yet on how exactly to manage PUBS. In general， it is vital to manage PUBS patients on a case-by-case basis.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】Purple urine bag syndrome (PUBS) is a rare phenomenon corre lated with the metabolism of tryptophan by gut microbiota to indole and conjugated in the liver to indoxyl sulfate， where it will be excreted into the kidney and further changes into indoxyl through the bacterial enzymatic activity of sulfatase and phos-phatase. Indoxyl will produce indigo (blue) and indirubin (red) pigment together with PVC bag forming the purple hue. Most PUBS cases are related to a benign condition； nevertheless，PUBScan be a sign of a dangerous condition. Health care professionals must be aware and alert of sudden urine discoloration as it may act as a guide concerning the patients' health. No particular management for PUBS is required apart from the eradication of UTI， improvement of urologic sanitation measures， and man-agement of underlying risk factors. In stewarding care towards patients，especially geriatrics and females， with a long-term in-dwelling catheter， constipation， bed-ridden， institutionalisation， and/or ESRD， health care professionals should take a measure of urologic sanitation to reduce the risk of developing UTIs and avoid any preventable complications， including PUBS.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Nonetheless， the anatomical challenges as well as the likelihood of vascular and airway lesions make it one of the most lethal injury types of all Abbreviated Injury Scale regions.\n\n【2】Traditional PNI management which divides PNI into anatomical zones is being reconsidered in light of high numbers of negative surgical explorations， weak correlation between the area of wounds and organ injury and significantly longer hospitalizations.\n\n【3】Case Report： A 52-year-old female was admitted after a self-inflicted， right para tracheal stab wound. A cervico-thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan excluded vascular and other organ lesions. A right pneumothorax was treated with a chest drain and a right exploratory cervicotomy was performed. A pharyngoscopy and an esophagos-copy showed no lesions.\n\n【4】Conclusions： Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) principles determine the initial assessment of PNI. Invasive airway manage-ment was required if orotracheal intubation is unfeasible. Hemodynamically unstable patients with platysma， vascular or aerodigestive lesions require surgery. Laryngotracheal injuries require panendoscopy and bronchos-copy prior to surgical exploration. Pharyngo-esophageal injuries may be treated conservatively. Esophageal le-sions require timing dependent surgery. Recently， a“no zone” approach irrespective of anatomical classifica-tion shows improved results in stable PNI. Multidetector helical CT with angiography (MDCT-A) significantly reduces negative exploratory surgery. Consensus regarding the best management of PNI is shifting， as increas-ing evidence suggests a \"no-zone\" approach is more beneficial and cost effective.\n\n【5】MeSH Keywords： Neck Injuries · Pneumothorax· Schizotypal Personality Disorder · Suicide， Attempted\n\n【6】Penetrating neck injuries (PNI) are defined as neck injuries that penetrate the platysma and make up 5% to 10% of trau-matic injuries in adults . Furthermore， in comparison to at tempted suicides， PNI constitute 1.6% to 3.0% of overall sui-cide attempts.\n\n【7】Nonetheless， the anatomical challenges as well as the likeli-hood of vascular and airway lesions make it one of the most lethal injury types of all Abbreviated Injury Scale regions. \n\n【8】Over the last decade， mortality in both civilian and military populations have been approximately 5% with death by exsan-guination being the most common cause of immediate death. Mortality from penetrating laryngotracheal trauma is 20% whilst mortality from pharyngoesophageal injuries reaches 22%\n\n【9】Potential lesions involve the blood vessels at the root of the neck， mediastinum， internal mammary arteries，vena azy-gos as well as intercostal vessels which may result in hema-tomas of the mediastinum， of the thoracic apex as well as hemo-pneumothorax.\n\n【10】Management of PNI has evolved considerably， moving from a widely accepted， mandatory exploratory surgical approach to a more selective， multidisciplinary approach due to high nega-tive exploration rates.\n\n【11】This has led to the creation of a zone-based approach to sta-ble PNI thus allowing the multidisciplinary team to classify PNI into anatomic zones.\n\n【12】More recently however， and as a result of improvement in diagnostic imaging， a\"no zone\" strategy has been developed. Patients are classified unstable or stable irrespective of the zone of neck injury. Unstable patients are treated in the operating room whilst stable but symptomatic patients undergo multide-tector computed tomography angiography (MDCT-A) which in combination with a clinical examination，indicate the need for further diagnostic tests or if surgical intervention is needed.\n\n【13】A rare case of a suicide attempt by stabbing in the neck result-ing in a contralateral pneumothorax is presented .\n\n【14】Case Report\n\n【15】A 52-year-old female consulted the Emergency Department of our institution because of a self-inflicted， right para tra-cheal stab wound to the neck with a 10 cm kitchen knife. The patient suffers from a schizotypal person-ality disorder associated with depression and has a history of2 suicide attempts， both violent and non-violent via phlebot-omy and prescription drug overdose respectively.\n\n【16】Upon arrival the patient was hemodynamically stable， with no active bleeding. Vital parameters where normal and a physical examination showed a left pneumothorax. A cervico-thoracic CT scan excluded any vascular lesions as well as any lesions to in-ternal organs . A naso-fiberscope showed no vocal cord paralysis. Blood tests where unremarkable. Hemoglobin levels were stable around 100 g/L.\n\n【17】In the operating room， a 28CH chest drain was inserted and a right exploratory cervicotomy was performed resulting in an iatrogenic right pneumothorax which was drained with a 28CH\nchest drain. The knife was removed and diffuse bleeding from the thyroid gland was stopped. A pharyngoscopy and an esoph-agoscopy showed no other lesions. The patient was then ad-mitted to the subintensive care unit where the right and left chest tubes were removed at post-operative day 1 and day 2respectively. A wide spectrum prophylactic antibiotic treatment of co-amoxicillin 2.2 g intravenous (IV) was continued for a to-tal of 7 days and at post-operative day 3， following a psychi-atric evaluation， the patient was transferred to the Psychiatric Department of our hospital.\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】Historically， the management of PNI has followed a 3-zone division. Zone 1 is between the sternal notch and the cricoid cartilage， zone2 is between the cricoid cartilage and the angle of the mandible and zone 3 is from the angle of the mandible to the skull base.\n\n【20】However， this approach is being reconsidered in light of the high numbers of negative surgical explorations in zone 2， hemodynamically stable injuries (13% to 19%) as well as a weak correlation between the area of wounds and actual or-gan injury and significantly longer hospitalizations due to ex-pensive， labor， and resource intensive procedures.Additionally， multiple ortrans cervical injuries might be impossible to cor-rectly classify into specific zones \n\n【21】Our patient epitomized this， presenting a right paramedian point of entry with an anteroinferior trajectory， lateral to the trachea， inferior to the thyroid gland， medial to the carotid ar-tery， and above the celiac plexus. The point of the blade was adjacent to the D3 vertebrae.\n\n【22】Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocols guide the pri-mary assessment of PNI. An intact platysma defines the wound as being superficial. Otherwise surgical consultation is required， ideally with the otolaryngology team. Cervical spine collars are not recommended except in the presence of focal neurology or a strong clinical suspicion of spinalinjury. Airway management initially includes clinical examination for signs of aero diges-tive tract injury. Invasive airway management should be per-formed in cases where orotrachealintubation is impossible .\n\n【23】The decision to operate is based on the patient’s physiologi-cal status and clinical findings. Hemodynamically unstable pa-tients with violation of the platysma and lesions to vascular or aero digestive structures (hard signs)， are in need of surgi-cal interventionHalf of all deaths from PNI are caused by exsanguination . Foley balloon catheter tamponade might be used in hemor-rhage not amenable by simple compression. Vascular injuries require an assessment with a vascular surgeon and zone 1 in-juries could require a cardiothoracic approach. Lesions to the internal carotid artery have a superior outcome if repaired as opposed to artery ligation， irrespective of preoperative focal neurological deficits was present \n\n【24】Laryngotracheal injuries require panendoscopy and bronchos-copy prior to surgical exploration. Conservative treatment may be indicated in cases of small mucosal defects or non-displaced fractures of the larynx. Open repair is needed in the presence of skeletal fractures or injuries to soft tissues .\n\n【25】Intravenous antibiotics and surgical nutrition are needed in patients with pharyngo-esophageal injuries. Esophageal in-jury or perforation require operative repair which is timing dependent .\n\n【26】If treatment is performed within 12 hours of injury， suture re-pair and drainage may be performed. After 12 hours of injury， a planned delayed repair should be performed because of the increase in morbidity and mortality associated with debride-ment and drainage .\n\n【27】More recently， a“no zone\" approach irrespective of anatomi-cal classification has shown improved outcomes in stable PNI. PNI can be managed based on an individual basis according to clinical findings and the patient's physiological status .\n\n【28】Furthermore， multidetector helical computed tomography with angiography (MDCT-A) significantly reduces negative explor-atory surgery .\n\n【29】However， some studies report a sensitivity in diagnosing pha-ryngo-esophageal injuries as low as 53% meaning that addi-tional imaging is often required .\n\n【30】The MDCT-A results may warrant further investigations with angiography， bronchoscopy， contrast swallow/flexible esopha-goscopy or surgical exploration .\n\n【31】Nonetheless， the management of PNI requires a multidisci-plinary approach. Studies support a selective operative man-agement of stable patients with a no-zone approach strati-fied according to patient stability. No clear indication exists for mandatory surgical exploration， especially with zone ll in-juries .\n\n【32】Conclusions\n\n【33】At this time， consensus regarding the best management of PNI is shifting as increasing evidence suggests a“no-zone”approach is more beneficial and cost effective， namely in re-ducing negative exploratory surgery", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

In most cases， traditional filtrating surgery has produced a low success rate. Drainage systems have been used over the last years for the surgical treatment of secondary refractory glaucoma and have pro-vided new possibilities of achieving good results with a low complication rate. The aim of this report was to present the results of implanting Ahmed Glaucoma Valves in two cases of difficult-to-treat refractory glaucoma with coexistent cat-aract due to recurrent uveitis in the first patient and con-genital cataract in the second.\n\n【9】CASE REPORTS\n\n【10】Patientl\n\n【11】A 23-year-old woman had a complicated cataract due to recurrent uveitis with anterior synechia， filtrating angle closure， total iris seclusion， and secondary glaucoma re-sistant to pharmacological treatment . Her vi-sual acuity in both eyes was only light perception with cor-rect localization of the light. The intraocular pressure in both eyes was between 29-34 mmHg when on maximal pharmacological treatment. The patient had been hospi-talized many times because of recurrent uveitis and diag-nosed at the Department of Immunological Disorders of Polish Mother’s Memorial Hospital.Laboratory studies re-vealed antibodies against myomesium (SMA 1：80， normal1：20)， normal Immunoglobulin IgG， IgM， and IgA levels， elevated antinuclear antibodies (1：640， normal 1：80)， bor-derline antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA， 1：20)，and ab-sent rheumatoid factor.\n\n【12】After a few years， steroid treatment (Solu Medrol，prednisone) andimmunosuppressive drugs were used. We had to stop the treatment because the patient became pregnant. Six months after childbirth， we decided to perform surgical treatment of the complicated cataract in the right eye. Phacoaspiration was performed and an intraocular lens (IOL) in the bag was implanted . Visual acuity in the right eye (RE) was0.1 after surgery， although the intraocular pressure (IOP) was high (30mmHg) and resistant to pharmacological treatment. The patient was very happy because it was the first time she could see her six-month-old baby .\n\n【13】After three weeks， the IOP was still elevated despite max-imal pharmacological treatment， so it was decided to im-plant an Ahmed Glaucoma Valve (AGV) into the right eye. This treatment was unsuccessful because of hypotony and retinal detachment six months after surgery. At this time， visual acuity in the RE was only light perception without localization and bulbar phthisis was observed .\n\n【14】Nine months after surgery of the right eye， the best-cor-rected visual acuity (BCVA) of the left eye (LE) was only light perception with correct localization. IOP was between30-35 mmHg. After an analysis of general health and the eye condition and obtaining eye experts' advice， surgical treatment was decided： phacoaspiration of the complicat-ed cataract without implantation of an IOL and widespread iridectomy in the left eye. We wanted to minimize the riskof IOP elevation (iris seclusion) because of the high reac-tivity of uveal tissue.\n\n【15】In the first three months after surgery， BCVA of the LE was 0.1 with +10.0D ofspherical correction.IOP was 20-22mmHg with two antiglaucoma eye-drops. Five months af-ter the operation we observed elevation of IOP resistant to pharmacological treatment， extensive anterior synechia， and visual acuity loss to 0.01. At present， eight months after surgery， we are considering what the next treatment should be. Due to the complication in the right eye and uncertain prognosis after the operation of the left eye， the patient re-fuses any further surgery .\n\n【16】Patient 2\n\n【17】A 24-year-old patient came to our hospital because of sec-ondary glaucoma resistant to pharmacological treatment in her existing RE with substantial loss of visual field. Twenty years before， at the age of four， she had an operation be-cause of congenital cataract with implantation of anterior1d1chamber intraocular lenses (ACIOL) in both eyes. Three years after surgery， secondary glaucoma developed in both eyes. Because the pharmacological treatment was not effec-tive， the ACIOL was removed and trabeculectomy was per-formed in the LE. Despite this， the eye lost the perception oflight. Trabeculectomy was performed in the right eye witha successful decrease in IOP， but after a few months， retinal detachment developed. Scleral buckling was performed and complete reattachment of the retina was achieved. In the follow-up， the IOP was elevated and pharmacological treat-ment was necessary. Visual acuity in the right eye was 1/50and IOP was 35 mmHg with maximal treatment. The visu-al field was reduced to a temporal field and examination of the fundus revealed extended glaucoma neuropathy. The examination showed extensive synechia between the ACIOL and iris and between the ACIOL and cornea .\n\n【18】We decided to implant an AGV with anterior chamber tube insertion in the right eye. The procedure was very difficult because of the scleral buckling band. Due to this， we ob-served little displacement in the direct pupil of the tube after the operation . After nine months of fol-low-up， visual acuity was stabilized at 0.02 and IOP was 18mmHg without pharmacological treatment. We did not observe any progression of glaucoma neuropathy or visual field loss .\n\n【19】DISCUSSION\n\n【20】The treatment of refractory glaucoma is still very difficult for surgeons. In most cases， traditional filtrating proce-dures (i.e. trabeculectomy) does not provide good results. Trabeculectomy with antimetabolites seems to give good re-sults of improving postoperative effects， but in most cases the results are not satisfactory . Secondary glaucoma is usually due to aniridia， aphakia， pseudophakia and irido-corneal syndromes， injuries， neovascularization， as well as congenital glaucoma and after keratoplasty and vitreoretinal surgery with silicon oil. The use of drainage systems in glau-coma surgery， which allows for an alternative way of aque-ous flow， seems to be good choice of surgical treatment of refractory glaucoma. Trials on the use drainage systems in the treatment of difficult cases of glaucoma have been per-formed since the second half of the last century. In 1969， Molteno published the first implant made of a tube con-nected with a polypropylene disc which was placed episcler-ally 12 mm from the limbus .\n\n【21】At present we have two main groups of implants. The first are those with a valve system whose opening is connected with the IOP and fluid flow is in one direction (Ahmed Glaucoma Valve， Krupin-Denver valve) and the second are flow systems without valves (Molteno， Baervelt， Schocket， ExPress). The latter do not have any resistance to the aque-ous flow and do not affect the direction of fluid flow . Because drainage devices have become more advanced tech-nologically， the use of these systems in the treatment of re-fractory glaucoma is more common.\n\n【22】The most common complication after AGV implantation is persistent hypotony， which may cause choroidal detach-ment， suprachoroidal hemorrhage， and retinal detachment. These complications are very serious and usually lead to the loss of an operating eye. Rare complications of seton devic-es are endophthalmitis， dislocation of the implant， self-re-moval of the implant， leakage of the filtration bleb， hem or-rhage to the anterior chamber or vitreous body， and tube occlusion .\n\n【23】In most publications the authors reveal positive effects of intraocular pressure reduction after the implantation of an AGV in cases of refractory glaucoma， with low complication rates . The efficiency of surgery with an AGV differs among many authors. According to Lee ， the positive follow-up was 83% in one year and 64.5% two years afterthe surgery. They showed that after implantation an AGV， patients needed less antiglaucoma drugs. They had hypot-ony in 10%， bullous keratopathy in 5%， and fibrosis of the filtration bleb in 17% of patients. Hong et al.  present-ed the benefits of the AGV in cases of refractory glaucoma after PPV in 83% of cases six months after surgery and in76% during the last visit. They noted postoperative hypotony， choroidal detachment， bullous keratopathy， the forming of fibrous membrane after inflammation， hyphema in the an-terior chamber， tube acclusion or tube removal， and phthi-sis. The complication rate differs in various publications， but it is undoubtedly connected with the type of glaucoma.\n\n【24】The two presented cases of young patients with secondary refractory glaucoma show how many difficulties we have to overcome and how many things we have to remember when treating patients with glaucoma due to systemic and eve diseases. Patients with recurrent uveitis should be op-erated during remission and usually after consultation with a general practitioner. In these cases， the operation has to be performed with serious attention and by an experienced surgeon. Before and after the operation， anti-inflammatory drugs， both topical and systemic， should be used.\n\n【25】Secondary glaucoma is one of the most common complica-tions of uveitis. In most publications the authors say that 20%of patients with uveitis have secondary glaucoma . The treatment of these cases is very difficult for ophthal-mologists. The success rate of trabeculectomy with or with-out antimetabolites varies from 50 to 100%1-2 years after surgery and 67% 5 years after surgery . There are numerous publications about the advantages of the AGV in cases of refractory glaucoma due to uveitis. These show the positive effect of AGV implantation in glaucoma due to uveitis with a 90% success rate in the first year after sur-gery and 60-68% two years after surgery. Some authors claim that the most important matter is to implant the valve during regression of uveitis and to treat patients with an-ti-inflammatory drugs before and after surgery . Some publications found that in this group of patients， uveitis af-ter AGV implan tation is not more frequent than in other groups. However， when uveitis occurs， it is during the first six months after surgery .\n\n【26】Our first patient， the 23-year-old women with congenital cataract and glaucoma resistant to traditional treatment， was very difficult to treat. Cataract removal in both eves did not provide the expected positive effect on lowering IOP， of which the patient had been informed. We knew that the second step in this case would be antiglaucoma surgery. Unfortunately， AGV implantation gave a very short， three-month effect. After this period of hypotony， retinal de-tachment and phthisis accurred. There is currently a great problem with the left eye， in which after cataract removal without PCIOL implantation， secondary glaucoma resistant to pharmacological treatment and corneal decompensation can be observed. At present the patient does not agree to any surgical procedures.\n\n【27】The second patient was operated at the age of three due to congenital glaucoma. After four years， implantation of ACIOLs was performed in both eyes. From other publica-tions we know that both pseudophakic and aphakic eyes may be causes of complications， i.e. secondary glaucoma .\n\n【28】Francois et al.  reported the presence of secondary glau-coma in 3% of pseudophakic eyes and 0.7-7% of aphakic eyes. In these cases， the mechanism of secondary glaucoma development is different. At an early postoperative period， iris seclusion， inflammatory reaction， or trabeculum occlu-sion can be risk factors. In eyes with an ACIOL attached to the iris， the most common complication is iris seclusion. In cases of persistent fragments of the lens， an inflammatory reaction may occur and it may cause trabeculum acclusion and difficulties with aqueous flow. Secondary glaucoma in these cases is usually due to an intensive inflammatory re-action with the formation of synechiae at the filtrating an-gle， iris synechia due to iris or vitreous body destruction during surgery， or the presence of vitreous body in the an-terior chamber.\n\n【29】Aphakic glaucoma is one of the most common complications after congenital cataract surgery and is present in 0-30%of patients. Due to the prolonged follow-up， the presence of secondary glaucoma is more frequent . It accurs in 41% of patients at five years follow-up after surgery . Aphakic glaucoma after lensectomy due to a congenital cat-aract is usually an open angle with late beginning. It is pres-ent in 75-93% of patients . In most cases， glau-coma due to aphakia develops a few years after lensectomy(4-12 years) . The etiopathogenesis of glaucoma development due to aphakia is not completely known， but one of the main causes is lensectomy in the first year of life.\n\n【30】This second patient came to our clinic with advanced glau-coma neuropathy and poor visual acuity in her only eye. Due to this situation， the decision to perform surgery was very difficult because it was her only eye and she was already being treated by psychiatrists due to deep depression. The patient believed deeply that the surgery would decrease IOP and save visual acuity. She was informed that the aim of the operation was to lower IOP and stop the progression of glaucoma neuropathy. In first few weeks we did not ob-serve any complications. In the nine-month follow-up， IOP is16.5 mmHg without additional pharmacological treatment. Visual acuity and the visual field are stable， with a clear cor-nea. Her psychiatric condition has drastically improved.\n\n【31】We presented two different， rather complicated cases of sec-ondary glaucoma resistant to treatment. In the first case， AGV implantation was unsuccessful， but in the second it was successful during nine months of follow-up. We want to underline how difficult the treatment of secondary re-fractory glaucoma can be. Furthermore， we always have to remember that complications may develop and in single-eyed patients and the choice of operating method is very difficult and sensitive.\n\n【32】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【33】AGV implantation in selected cases of refractory glaucoma seems to be an effective method for IOP reduction.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Her pain had been going for the last 2 years and was regarded as \"pretrigeminal neuralgia\"； however， it progressed in frequency over the last 2 weeks， with no clear identifying triggering factors.

The prevalence is approximately 130/100 000 in the United States， with African Americans， Hispanics and Asians more frequently affected than non-Hispanic whites . It has a female predominance with approximately 9：1 ratio and the onset is usually during the re-productive years. The symptoms and signs may start abruptly or may take months or years before the diagnosis can be con-firmed. The American College of Rheumatology case definitions collectively have detected the presence of 14-17 out of the 19neuropsychiatric SLE syndromes among adults and reported total spectrum of headache (39-61%)， seizures (8-18%)， cere-brovascular disease (2-8%)， psychosis (3-5%)， cranial neurop-athy (1.5-2.1%)， and movement disorder (1%) .\n\n【7】Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a neuropathic disorder of one or both of the trigeminal nerves， and is more common among females and people over age 50. It can be either primary with unknown precise cause or secondary， which might be associ-ated with some other diseases； with symptoms of extreme， sporadic，sudden burning or shock-like face paintriggered by common activities such as eating， talking， shaving， and tooth brushing. Although TN is not a fatal disorder， it can greatly im-pair patient quality of life . Currently considered explana-tions are vascular pressing on the trigeminal nerve in its root entry zone， a demyelinization of trigeminal sensory fibers， and jawbone cavity， but these fail to sufficiently explain the total clinical picture .\n\n【8】We report a case of an African American woman who pre-sented to us with 2 variable presentations of SLE over a short span of time.\n\n【9】Case Report\n\n【10】A 53-year-old woman (African American， Jamaican， ex-smok-er of 30 pack years) who presented with multiple joint pains and stiffness was diagnosed with SLE after thorough investi-gation. She was given 1 dose of intramuscular Depo-Medrol and started on oral methotrexate 20 mg weekly and oral fo-lic acid 1 mg every day. Three months later， she complained of right-sided， sharp， electric shock-like facial pain starting at the side of her right nostril and traveling down the naso-la-bial fold and then back to the angle of the jaw， mostly in the region of V2-V3 distribution with no radiation beyond tri-geminal distribution. She said that her pain paroxysm usual-ly lasted for around a week， went away without warning， andthen returned 2-3 weeks later. She stated that the pain has been occurring for the last 2 years. It was suspected to have a dental origin， and an unnecessary dental procedure was per-formed. However， the pain still persisted and progressed in frequency but was limited to the region of V2-V3 distribution over the last 2 weeks， with no clear identifying triggering fac-tors and was temporarily relieved with ibuprofen. She found no triggers of pain paroxysms by chewing， talking， brushing teeth， cold air， smiling， and/or grimacing. There was no histo-ry of fever， chills， vomiting， diarrhea， chest pain， malar rash， oral ulcers， weight loss， jaw claudication， altered taste sensa-tions， lacrimation， conjunctival injection， rhinorrhea，difficulty in chewing， or sicca symptoms. She denied any lupus flare-up episodes and/or any other past neurological manifestations of lupus， including seizures， movement disorder， hemiparesis， pe-ripheral neuropathy， autonomic disorder， or psychotic disorder.\n\n【11】Table 1.

We hereby present a rare case of TN with SLE and propose this unique presentation of atypical trigeminal pain in SLE patient as “lupus neuropathy\".\n\n【18】Hagen et al.  reported 2 cases of TSN in SLE among 81studied subjects； however， none of the patients had a pain syndrome similar to TN. They found 26% prevalence of TSN in mixed connective tissue disease， 19% scleroderma， 2%rheumatoid arthritis (RA)， 2% Sjogren syndrome， 1% dermato-myositis， and 47% undifferentiated connective tissue disorder(CTD). It is still unexplained why TSN occurs more frequent-ly in certain CTDs as compared to others. However， the inci-dence of other neurologic manifestations in these less com-mon CTDs is generally lower than reported among patients with SLE or RA\n\n【19】Among the collagen vascular diseases， neurological manifes-tations have been most commonly recognized and well-stud-ied in SLE. Nervous system involvement in SLE has been re-ported to vary from 40% to 70% . It may occur at any time during the course of the disease， but is rarely the first man-ifestation of SLE. Interestingly， trigeminal neuropathy is sel-dom mentioned as a symptom in nervous system SLE but has been observed as the only neurological manifestation of the disease among 2 cases reported by Ashworth and Tait .\n\n【20】The diagnosis of TN is usually based on the characteristic clini-cal picture， which consists of key clinical features and physical examination showing no clinical evidence of neurological defi-cit or mild sensory impairment in trigeminal nerve distribution. Although there are fairly standard treatment approaches for TN， management with either anti-epileptic drugs or surgical pro-cedures both carries risks of adverse effects， recurrence， and complications. However， there are few studies which direct-ly compare medical and surgical treatments. Pharmacological therapy for TN has been the subject of several Cochrane sys-tematic reviews and available evidence shows carbamazepine is the best-studied treatment and drug of choice for initial and long-term management of TN， as prescribed in our patient .\n\n【21】The pathogenesis of lupus neuropathy is multifocal process-es involving vasculitis causing destructive changes in the vasa nervorum， microangiopathy， intrathecal production of proin-flammatory cytokines， premature atherosclerosis， demyelin-ation， immune complex deposition， and antibody-mediated damage . However， there is little pathological informa-tion about TN cases. Vasculitis affecting the trigeminal nerve branches， particularly at the sites where they are tightly in-vested by dura and more susceptible to edema， as well as con-sequent rise in endoneurial pressure， seems to be a possible pathophysiological mechanism in the context of autoimmune disease. Fibrosis of the epineurium and perineurium might increase the endoneurial pressure and preferentially damage myelinated trigeminal fibers. Direct injury induced by vascu-lopathy may affect the blood-brain barrier， thereby allowing antibodies to enter the central nervous system. There is ex-perimental evidence showing increased permeability of the trigeminal ganglion blood vessels to proteins and antibodies as compared to the blood-brain barrier . It has been prov-en that in the rat， horseradish peroxidase passes from venous blood into the extracellular space of the trigeminal ganglion within 2 min， in comparison to penetration of the endoneu-rial space within 5 min .\n\n【22】Vasculitic changes， neural tissue fibrosis， and increased per-meability of trigeminal blood vessels seen among SLE patients might predispose them to the development of TN. However，why the trigeminal fibers are selectively involved still remains controversial. Further studies to investigate the SLE-mediated injury to trigeminal fibers are recommended to make a time-ly diagnosis of TN or any other lupus neuropathy and to pre-vent progressive autoimmune process-related vasculitic and demyelinating changes. Investigation of underlying autoim-mune disease must be done among newly diagnosed high-risk patients with TN， as it might precede the diagnosis of SLE or any other autoimmune disease.\n\n【23】Conclusions\n\n【24】Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem auto-immune disorder of unknown etiology reported to be asso-ciated with several neurological manifestations. We report a rare case of trigeminal neuralgia in a patient with SLE to raise awareness among health care providers that trigeminal neu-ralgia can be manifested before， after， or at the time of SLE diagnosis. Further studies to investigate the selective involve-ment of trigeminal fibers in SLE are recommended to make a timely diagnosis of TN and to prevent progressive autoim-mune process-related vasculitic and demyelinating changes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Prolonged ventricular repolarizations in individuals with the disorder can cause fatal arrhythmias. Abnormal functioning of cardiac ion channels leads to arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes (TdP) and may be triggered by stress or medications. Many medications used in the perioperative period are triggers for the arrythmia\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 7-year-old patient with known congenital LQTS type 2 presented for bilateral myringotomy and tube place-ment. The patient was otherwise healthy and taking propranolol daily. Preoperative midazolam was adminis-tered for anxiolysis， and induction of anesthesia was uneventful. He sustained an episode of TdPimmediately following general anesthetic induction after failure of an in situ automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrilla-tor (AICD). External defibrillation succeeded， and the patient was stabilized in the Postanesthesia Recovery Unit before transfer to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. Interrogation of the AICD revealed several undelivered de-fibrillation attempts. A chest X-ray showed an area suggestive of an epicardial electrode fracture. The follow-ing day， the AICD was replaced with no arrythmias noted. The patient had an uneventful recovery.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】In patients with a known history of LQTS， preparation and prevention are cornerstones of anesthesia care. Minimizing the use of triggering medications and emotional stress in the perioperative period， combined with ready equipment and medications to respond to arrythmias， are essential. In children， there is a greater chance of lead fracture and resulting device failure. Preoperative history of device function or interrogation of the AICD and possibly a chest X-ray are essential to ensure the integrity of the leads.\n\n【6】MeSH Keywords： Anesthesia， General · Anesthesia， Inhalation· Long QT Syndrome· Pediatrics ·Torsades de PointesCongenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) results from mutations in cardiac ion channels . On electrocardiogram (ECG)， prolonged OT intervals and T-wave abnormalities from extended ventricu-lar repolarization are hallmarks of the disease. The condition can present as recurrent episodes of syncope， seizure-like episodes，or cardiac arrest. If untreated， sudden death may result from torsades de pointes (TdP) degenerating to ventricular fibrillation . We present a case of a 7-year-old child with known congenital LQTS and an automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) in situ who sustained an episode of TdP after anesthetic induction for a scheduled minor surgical procedure. Written authorization(under the Health Insurance Portability and Accounting Act) to use existing protected health information was obtained from the patient's guardian for publication of this case.\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】A 7-year-old child (weight 26 kg， height 124 cm) presented for myringotomy and ear tube placement. He had a past his-tory of LQTS type 2， and an epicardial dual-chamber/epicardi-al patch AICD had been implanted 2 years prior without any anesthesia complications. No history of the AlCD firing was noted during his cardiology follow-up since its placement. He had no other medical issues. Family history was positive for LQTS in the mother and sister. The child's routine medications included propranolol. His preoperative vital signs were stable， and examination findings were normal. The pacemaker clinic recommended no changes to the AICD programming， and no interrogation was performed the day of surgery because use of surgical cautery was not planned. No ECG was performed preoperatively on the day of surgery. His ECG from more than1 year ago revealed normal sinus rhythm with QT and QTc in-tervals of 482 and 559 milliseconds， respectively. All previ-ous ECGs had a QTc interval of greater than 500 milliseconds. An echocardiogram， approximately 1 year ago， revealed nor-mal biventricular size and function.\n\n【9】The child received oral midazolam for preoperative anxioly-sis. In the operating room， following application of standard American Society of Anesthesiologists monitoring， inhalation-al induction was achieved with a 50： 50 mixture of nitrous ox-ide/oxygen and sevoflurane. The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm . Shortly after anesthesia induction， the ECG monitor revealed a pattern of bigeminy  and trigeminy， followed by 5 beats of ventricular tachycar-dia， which resolved spontaneously to normal sinus rhythm. Sevoflurane was immediately discontinued； 100% oxygen was administered in preparation of awakening the patient. External defibrillator pads were applied. Two minutes later， the ECG monitor revealed ventricular bigeminy followed by a pattern suggestive of TdP. The episode of TdP resolved spon-taneously.Intravenous access was established during this ep-isode. Laboratory results revealed a serum potassium lev-el of 4.1 mmEq/L Two minutes later， a sustained episode of TdP was noted ， and external cardiac defibrillation was successfully attempted (50J) due to the failure of the in situ AICD to respond. Following defibrillation， narrow complex tachycardia was noted (130-150 bpm) with return of spon-taneous circulation. Magnesium sulfate (30 mg/kg) was ad-ministered intravenously. The child was transported to the Postanesthesia Care Unit (PACU) with a normal sinus rhythm and in stable condition.\n\n【10】The cardiology team performed AICD device interrogation in the PACU. Evaluation of the device revealed 6 failed attempt-ed therapies during this incident. The chest X-ray revealed an area suggestive of epicardial electrode fracture .\n\n【11】The child was admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. He was monitored on telemetry， and defibrillation pads re-mained in place overnight. A transvenous single-chamber sin-gle-coil AICD was placed under general anesthesia the follow-ing day. The patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged to home.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】We have presented the case of a child with congenital LQTS type 2 and an AICD device， who received anesthesia. Device malfunction resulted in cardiac arrest requiring treatment with defibrillation and intravenous magnesium therapy. This case presents 2 important learning points：  preoperative prep aration of a child with an AICD， and  anesthetic manage-ment of a child with congenital LQTS.\n\n【14】LQTS can be congenital or acquired， although up to 30% of carri-ers of LQTS are asymptomatic and have a normal QT interval and Schwartz score . Acquired LQTS denotes patients with normal QTc at baseline who may develop fatal arrhythmias when ex-posed to triggering agents. Due to the complex nature of LQTS genetics， patients may appear to have a normal phenotype un-less their reserve is sufficiently depleted by stress or medica-tions . Medications that may induce TdP include certain an-tiarrhythmics， antibiotics， antiemetics， and induction agents . The mutations in congenital LQTS mainly relate to dysfunction-al proteins that disrupt the ion channel function or change the voltage threshold . There are 15 major types of LQTS identi-fied， but LQTS types 1， 2， and 3 are the most common . Our patient was a known carrier of LQTS type 2， but any patient with latent disease may suddenly present with symptoms of LQTS due to the stress and pharmacology of an anesthetic.\n\n【15】Anesthesia management must include strategies for both pre-vention and treatment of arrhythmias that can lead to cardi-ac arrest. Preoperative prevention includes maintaining ther-apy with beta-blockers up to the day of surgery. Beta-blockers are the mainstay of prophylactic therapy for LQTS， but effica-cy varies depending on the genotype. LQTS type 1 responds best to beta-blockers， which are less protective in LQTS types2 and 3. Maintaining serum potassium levels in the high-nor-mal range of 4.5 to 5 mEq/L may be protective， especially in patients with LQTS type 2 whose ion channel abnormality is sensitive to serum potassium levels . Adequate premedi-cation to reduce anxiety， and thereby sympathetic activation， is of paramount importance. Premedication with midazolam is preferred over dexmedetomidine because there are mixed reports in the literature about the effects of dexmedetomi-dine on QTc.\n\n【16】The Heart Rhythm Society， along with the American Society of Anesthesiologists， recommends communication with the heart rhythm team prior to any procedure and a thorough review of the records . In patients with a well-established congeni-tal LQTS diagnosis， a prolonged QTc is a known finding. In the above case， a preoperative ECG was not performed on the day of surgery because the patient had previously diagnosed con-genital LQTS type 2 with a QTc greater than 500 milliseconds on all previous ECGs.\n\n【17】Interrogation of the device in question may or may not be nec-essary depending on the record of recent device checks . Generally， implanted pacemakers and defibrillators are checked by technicians when electrocautery is planned because AICD tachycardia therapies would need to be turned off in this set-ting. Devices of pacemaker-dependent patients should be placed in an asynchronous pacing mode， preventing inhibi-tion of their device and subsequent asystole from cautery . Patients typically receive an identification card with the type of device they have (company)， thus making interrogation of the device more straightforward. Ideally， a child with an AICD should have the device function confirmed before undergoing a surgical procedure. In the above case， a preoperative inter-rogation of the AICD would have indicated lead malfunction. There may be an increased rate of lead fracture in children compared with adults because of growth and a greater activ-ity level . Several strategies are used in this instance， including review of preoperative chest X-ray， recent device in-terrogation， and medical records. If none are available， pre-operative consultation along with a device check is warrant-ed  .\n\n【18】Intraoperatively， the main objectives are to prevent sympathet-ic excitation and to avoid factors that prolong QT interval . An extensive list exists of medications that prolong the QT in-terval， and various drugs used in the perianesthesia periodmay need to be avoided . In general， anesthetic agents have depressive effects on cardiovascular physiology. All volatile agents can prolong the QTc interval， although they do so to varying degrees， likely depending on the genotype of the in-dividual . Generally， patients with LQTS are not triggered by volatile agents if they are appropriately beta-blocked. Isoflurane is the agent of choice because there it may shorten QT inter-val . Narcotics assist in reducing adrenergic stimulation and fentanyl is preferred， especially over sufentanil， which may increase the QTc interval . Muscle relaxants such as succinylcholine and pancuronium can stimulate sympathetic responses and increase the QT interval， and therefore， they should be avoided . Rocuronium and vecuronium are pre-ferred neuromuscular blocking agents. Propofol may be benefi-cial because it either causes no change or shortens the QTc in-terval . For nausea and vomiting prophylaxis， droperidol is known to prolong the QTc interval. Ondansetron is considered to be a possible risk； however， its safety profile is better .\n\n| ■ Identify type of AICD  |\n| --- |\n| ■ Review AICD device  |\n| 口 Review medical records  |\n| ■ Consult Pediatric Cardiology  |\n| ■ Check electrolytes on day of procedure  |\n| ■ Consider chest X-rav  |\n\n【20】AICD - automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.\n\n【21】If an arrhythmia is triggered， medications and equipment must be immediately available. First， discontinue the trigger-ing agent， which during an anesthetic， is likely the volatile agent. TdP is treated with magnesium 30 mg/kg bolus over 2to 3 minutes followed by an infusion . In stable patients with TdP resistant to magnesium， transcutaneous or transve-nous pacing can be used to increase the heart rate and short-en the QT interval . Some LQTS patients do benefit from overdrive pacing when the TdP is induced by bradycardia orpause episodes. It is unclear， specifically， in patients with LQTS type 2 if ventricular overdrive pacing would shorten the QTc interval prophylactically. Any unstable patient should receive unsynchronized defibrillation and initiation of chest compres-sions. Some reports discuss using isoproterenol or dobutamine in patients with acquired LQTS who do not respond to magne-sium； however， this is not indicated in patients with congeni-tal LQTS because the increased adrenergic state may worsen the arrhythmia . Any patient experiencing serious com-plications of LQTS should have immediate consultation and assessment with a pediatric electrophysiologist. Long-term therapy often includes AICD placement or left cardiac sympa-thetic denervation.\n\n【22】Conclusions\n\n【23】Although LQTS syndrome is not a common disorder， it affects about 1 in every 2000 individuals， making it a disorder the an-esthesiologist may frequently encounter . Beta-blockade， anxiolytics， and pain control will minimize the risk of triggering sustained perioperative arrhythmias in LQTS patients. In chil-dren， specifically， there is greater chance of lead fracture and resulting device failure. Documented history of device func-tion or interrogation of the AICD and possibly a chest X-ray are also essential to ensure the integrity of the leads. Having magnesium and a defibrillator on standby will minimize treat-ment delays if a ventricular arrhythmia occurs. In patients with a known history of LQTS， preparation and prevention are the cornerstones of anesthesia care.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Management options range from observation to anticoagulation and interventional therapies such as transjugular intrahepatic por-tosystemic shunts (TIPS)， thrombolysis， or surgical thrombectomy. For select patients with little success from traditional medical therapies and previously failed TIPS procedures， a direct transhepatic approach to restor-ing blood flow and resolving variceal bleeding may be appropriate.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 31-year-old man with a past medical history of portal hypertension， refractory ascites， gastroesophageal var-ices， and decompensated cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse had previously undergone an unsuccessful TIPS placement.

There is a paucity of existing litera ture and evidence-based recommendations regarding the op-tima. treatment approach to chronically occluded portal veins. Management options range from observation to anticoagula-tion and interventional therapies， such as transjugular intra-hepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS)， thrombolysis， and sur-gical thrombectomy . We report a case of chronic PVT and main portal vein reconstruction in the presence of a massive coronary vein and actively bleeding gastroesophageal varices. This case report fulfilled the institutional criteria for exemp-tion from institutional review board approval.\n\n【9】Case Report\n\n【10】A 31-year-old man with decompensated cirrhosis (model for end-stage liver disease of 17) secondary to alcohol abuse was referred to interventional radiology for TIPS placement. The patient had a history of portal hypertension， refractory asci-tes， gastroesophageal varices， and a previously unsuccessful TIPS placement. Upon review of preprocedural imaging， ab-dominal computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a cirrhotic liver， splenomegaly， and gastroesophageal varices compatible with portal hypertension. Also noted were focal calcifications in the region of the diminutive main portal vein， medial splen-ic vein， and superior mesenteric vein， compatible with sequa-lae of chronic thrombosis . We recanalized the main portal vein and coiled off the massive coronary vein that was supplying a mass network of gastroesophageal varices.\n\n【11】Using a percutaneous transhepatic approach， a 22-gauge Chiba needle (Cook Medical， Bloomington， IN， USA) was advanced into the right lobe of the liver under ultrasound guidance. A diminutive intrahepatic portal venous branch was accessed， and a 0.046-cm wire was advanced through the Chiba nee-dle. A dermatotomy incision was made and the needle was ex-changed for a Greb set (Teleflex). The inner portion of the Greb set and the wire were removed and an Amplatz wire was ad-vanced into the main portal vein. A 6-French vascular sheath was advanced over the Amplatz wire. Hand-injection digital subtraction venography demonstrated chronic long-segment occlusion of the main portal vein with cavernous transfor-mation . The occluded segment of the main portal vein was successfully crossed using a 5-French Kumpe cath-eter and Glidewire. The Kumpe catheter was advanced into the superior mesenteric vein and hand-injection digital sub-traction venography was performed， demonstrating wide pa-tency of the superior mesenteric vein and inferior mesenteric vein. Chronic occlusion of the main portal vein was again notedand a massive coronary vein supplying a network of gastro-esophageal varices was identified . An Amplatz wire was advanced into the superior mesenteric vein. Angioplasty was performed on the occluded segment of the main portal vein using 6-mm and 8-mm balloons. Following this， overlap-ping balloon-expandable bare metal stents (Boston Scientific Express)， measuring 10x37 mm and 8x37 mm， were placed across the portal segment occlusion. Flow through the main por-tal vein was achieved.A 5-French JB1 catheter was then usedto cannulate the coronary vein. A microcatheter was advanced distally. The coronary vein was embolized using a series of coils：035”20 mmx20 cm Nester (Cook Medical， Bloomington， IN， USA)， 035” 20 mmx39 cm Azur (Terumo Medical Corporation， Somerset， NJ， USA)， and 28 mmx60 cm and 32 mmx60 cm stan-dard Ruby (Penumbra Inc.， Alameda，CA， USA). The 035\" coils were placed through the 5-French JB1 catheter and the Ruby coils were placed through the microcatheter. Repeat hand-in-jection digital subtraction venography was performed throughthe superior mesenteric vein and demonstrated occlusion of the coronary vein with hepatopedal flow through the native main portal vein status after stenting . The sheath and catheter were then removed， and the Amplatzer Vascular Plug Ⅳ (AMP Ⅳ) was deployed into the hepatic puncture site to achieve hemostasis. The patient was transported to the\n\n【12】Post-Anesthesia Care Unit in stable condition and was released the next day， without any complications.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】PVT has a prevalence of 5% to 25% in the cirrhotic patient population， with a higher prevalence observed in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Despite PVT being a common phenomenon in this patient population， the literature does not provide a standardized approach to management. Over the last 2 decades， TIPS has emerged as an effective means of portal decompression in patients with complications relat-ed to portal hypertension. However， in the setting of chronic PVT，TIPS procedures pose a greater challenge. Chronic PVT of-ten results in fibrosis and narrowing of the main portal vein， restricting portal vein access via the transjugular route and passage through the occluded segment .\n\n【15】In the present case， the patient previously experienced an un-successful TIPS attempt due to the inability to pass a wire into the main portal vein via the transjugular route. Thus， an alter-native approach to treatment was warranted. Direct transhe-patic and transsplenic approaches have been well document-ed in the literature as a response to technical difficulties with TIPS. In the present case， we selected to use a direct transhe-patic approach using real-time ultrasound guidance. A direct transhepatic approach allows for direct access to the main por-tal vein along the long-axis and easier access to the peripher-al intrahepatic portal branches . A major concern with this approach is an increased risk of bleeding. There are many fac-tors that contribute to an increased bleeding risk， but insuf-ficient closure of the percutaneous intrahepatic tract is the most significant contributing factor . To mitigate the risk of bleeding， we used an AMP I to achieve hemostasis of the transhepatic access.\n\n【16】Bleeding gastric varices occur less frequently than esopha-geal varices but are associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality. The incidence of gastric varices in patients withcirrhosis ranges between 2% and 20% with a bleeding risk of44% at year 3 of follow-up among patients without a histo-ry of bleeding . Current management strategies of gastric varices are aimed at primary prophylaxis， acute events， and secondary prophylaxis. To prevent the first bleeding event， the use of nonselective beta-blockers (NSBBs) has been rec-ommended. Emerging evidence has shown the superiority of endoscopic ultrasound-guided placement of cyanoacrylate and cyanoacrylate combined with vascular coils over NSBBs. However， recommendations around cyanoacrylate injections for primary prophylaxis have not been set forth due to the paucity of research. In the case of an acute variceal hemor-rhage and secondary prophylaxis， several management op-tions exist. Endoscopic band ligation is a well-established in-tervention， but endoscopic ultrasound-guided therapies have proven successful and shown higher rates of initial hemosta-sis and lower rates of rebleeding . When secondary prophy-laxis fails - most commonly， NSBBs combined with endoscop-ic treatments - more aggressive interventions， such as TIPS， are indicated. In our patient with decompensated cirrhosis and an impressive coronary vein， TIPS followed by coil emboliza-tion was most appropriate. This case illustrates one extreme of a variceal embolization： a massive coronary vein requiring complex large volume coil embolization to achieve hemostasis.\n\n【17】Conclusions\n\n【18】We report a unique case of a patient with chronic portal vein thrombosis with cavernous transformations who developed a massive coronary vein feeding a large network of gastroesoph-ageal varices. This case is significant because it identifies a po-tential approach to treatment in patients with rebleeding after traditional management and a previously failed TIPS procedure.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Few literatures suggest a connection between the hormonal changes in pregnancy and the rapid growth of branchial cleft cysts. We report a case of a branchial cleft cyst that occurred during the last trimester of pregnancy. Also， we provide the current literature that aids in the diagnosis and treatment of branchial cleft cyst. The main aim of presenting this case is to establish a relationship between the rapid growth of branchial cleft cysts and hormonal changes in pregnancy.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Branchial cleft anomalies， branchial cleft cyst， hormonal changes in pregnancy\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Branchial cleft anomalies include the formation of cysts， sinuses， fistulas or cartilaginous remnants and result from developmen-tal changes of the branchial apparatus. There are four different types of branchial cleft cysts that differ by the clinical presenta-tion and fistula pathway. The most common Branchial cleft cyst is the second， which is usually diagnosed in the second decade of life with equal prevalence in both genders. The anomaly presents as a lateral neck mass along the anterior bor-der of the sternocleidomastoid muscle， and the cyst is lined by squamous epithelium. The principle of managing the Second branchial cleft cyst includes： early diagnosis of the condition and controlling infection with antibiotics followed by full excision\n\n【4】Case report\n\n【5】Twenty-nine years old female is a known case of iron deficiency anaemia presented to the outpatient office in the department ofhead and neck surgery with left side neck swelling. The swelling was first noticed by the patient when she was eight months pregnant (around 32 weeks of gestation) and sought medical care after one month of noticing the swelling. The swelling started as a painless mass， then as it progressively increased in size， the patient started to complain of dull neck pain with mouth opening and moving the neck toward the mass site. No skin changes were noticed on the overlying skin， and no history of upper respiratory tract infection prior to her complaints. The patient did not notice swelling in another body part， and this is her first time to experience this complaint.\n\n【6】·Past Medical history： Iron deficiency anaemia.\n\n【7】·Past Surgical History： A gynaecological surgery was done under general anaesthesia with no complications.\n\n【8】·Allergies： Allergic to Ⅳ iron\n\n【9】·Current Medications： iron supplement and combined oral contraceptives.\n\n【10】· Transfusion History： received 2 units of packed RBCs after delivery.\n\n【11】· Immunized up to date.\n\n【12】On Examination， the patient is well built. Conscious， alert and oriented. A swelling was noticed in the left mid-cervical region anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle measuring about 10x13 cm in diameter. The mass was fluctuant， well-circumscribed and painless on palpation. Lymph nodes could not be appreciated on palpation.\n\n【13】Needle aspiration of the cyst was done and sent for cul-\n\n【14】ture. Aspirated fluid showed few WBCs， epithelial cells， gram-positive bacilli and gram-positive cocci with no significant growth after five days of incubation. Neck CT was done show-ing a left-sided neck cyst， likely branchial cyst and followed by neck MRI for pre-operative planning. MRI findings were： Large left round lesion measuring 4.4x3.6x5.3 cm adjacent to the angle of the mandible containing fluid suggestive of the branchial cleft cyst. The cyst lies deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle， adja-cent to and elevating the lower border of the left parotid gland with displacement and narrowing of the left internal jugular vein and the left facial vein. Another MRI finding was： bilat-eral prominent upper cervical lymph nodes most likely reactive.\n\n【15】The patient was admitted； a nasopharyngeal swab for the screening of Covid-19 was done 24 hours prior to surgery and came negative. Full labs， including CBC， admission profile and coagulation profile， were done.\n\n【16】The patient underwent surgical excision of the cyst and biopsy obtained through the following operative procedure：\n\n【17】·Under General anaesthesia. The patient prepared， draped and positioned (supine position， head tilted to the right side).\n\n【18】·Left cervical horizontal incision， 3 fingers width below the mandible anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle， mea-suring about 3.5 cm was done.\n\n【19】·Superficial and deep cervical fascia incised.\n\n【20】· Platysma separated， and the sternocleidomastoid retracted posteriorly.\n\n【21】·Deep mobilizing around the mass with flaps raised superi-orly and inferiorly.\n\n【22】· Capsule wall identified and plane mobilized \\[figure2，34J.· Cyst excised \n\n【23】·Regional IIlymph nodes excised.\n\n【24】·Bleeding was controlled and hemoderm powder was ap-plied1.\n\n【25】Subcutaneous stitching done with vicryl and skin closed with subeuticular Aberdeen knot.\n\n【26】· Cyst and excised lymph node sent to histopathological eval-uation.\n\n【27】Histopathological evaluation was confirmative. The patient recovered well with no complications.\n\n【28】Fates of secretion of estrogens and progesterone，and con-certration of human chorionic gonadotropin at different stages uf pregnancy.\n\n【29】Discussion\n\n【30】Branchial cleft cysts are the common differential diagnosis of lateral neck swelling. They usually occur unilaterally but can be bilateral as well. The most common type of branchial cleft cysts is the second， which makes about 95% of branchial anomalies.\n\n【31】A second branchial cleft cyst is classified into four subtypes according to Bayley's classification. Typel： Anterior to the stern-ocleidomastoid muscle and deep to the platysma. Type2： Deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and lateral to the carotid sheath (the most common). Type3： Lies between the internal and external carotid arteries up to the lateral pharyngeal wall. Type4： Medial to the carotid sheath. Lying in the pharyngeal mucosal space. The discussed case is in line with the second branchial cleft cyst in its third subtype.\n\n【32】It is important to differentiate between different causes of lateral neck masses such as branchial cleft cysts and malignant cystic adenopathy. One of the useful tests that aids in this differ-entiation are a contrast-enhanced neck CT scan that can show unique features of branchial cleft cysts. Brachial cleft cysts are larger than cystic adenopathy with less likely septation or ex-tracapsular spread. This differentiation is significant in clinical decision making.\n\n【33】In our case， the patient underwent various diagnostic tests to prevent any misdiagnosis or delay in management. The workupincluded： Neck CT followed by MRI. The diagnosis was then confirmed by histopathological evaluation of the excised cyst.\n\n【34】A retrospective study that was done between 1999 and 2009， including 12 patients who were diagnosed with branchial cleft anomalies. Out of the 12 patients， eight had left-sided neck swelling， and 11 had their swelling along the anterior border of the upper part of the sternocleidomastoid muscle， which is similar to our patient's presentation. In this study， 3 patients were initially managed with incision and drainage followed by antibiotics therapy. All of these 3 had a recurrence of the swelling. patients who were managed by complete surgical excision of the cyst recovered without recurrence. \n\n【35】The discussed case noticed the neck swelling during her preg-nancy， which may provide a link between the hormonal changes in pregnancy and the rapid growth of the branchial cleft cyst. During pregnancy， the placenta produces human chorionic go-nadotropin， estrogen， progesterone and human chorionic so-matomammotropin， which areimportant to maintain a normal pregnancy.\n\n【36】Human chorionic gonadotropin aids in the production of estrogen and progesterone which stabilize the endometrium to support the embryonic development. Progesterone and estrogen are produced by the syncytial trophoblast cells of the placenta. Estrogen reaches 30 times the normal rates towards the end of pregnancy， and progesterone increases 10 times the normal levels in non-pregnancy cycles.\n\n【37】Human chorionic somatomammotropin reduces insulin sen-sitivity and decreases glucose utilization. It also helps the release of fatty acids from fat stores .\n\n【38】There is no sufficient literature that supports the direct rela tionship between hormonal changes in pregnancy and the rapid growth of branchial cleft cysts. The first study that included a tissue-based explanation of the growth of branchial cleft cysts in pregnant women was done by evaluating the presence of estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) in tissue specimen of 16 patients who were diagnosed with branchial cleft cysts. 3 of the included patients were pregnant females. Estrogen receptor alpha was detected only in the branchial cleft cysts of pregnant women. This study helps in connecting hormonal pregnancy changes and branchial cleft cysts growth in a direct relationship. How-ever， more studies are needed to create a solid scientific base for this finding.\n\n【39】Conclusion\n\n【40】In summary， this case was unusual as the patient noticed the neck swelling during her pregnancy which requires further studying the relationship between the hormonal changes in pregnancy and the rapid growth of the branchial cleft cyst. The patient's condition required a unique approach to prevent mis-management. Various diagnostic tests were applied， and a full surgical excision was performed to prevent a recurrence.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It is often discovered incidentally. Symp-toms are usually represented by dysphagia and hematemesis. Surgical resection with histological confrontation is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. We report the case of an 80-year-old woman who was consulted for dysphagia.\n\n【6】An 80-year-old woman without previous medical history com-plained of progressive dysphagia for solid foods. Symptoms were exacerbated at mealtimes. The patient reported a dete-rioration of her general condition. However， the physical ex-amination was unremarkable. An upper gastrointestinal en-doscopy was indicated for this dysphagia， which revealed a pale blue submucosal tumour 16 cm in extent and was biopsied. A thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT scan for extension objectified in the posteroinferior mediastinum， a voluminous mass whose epicentre is the lower third of the thoracic and abdominal oe-sophagus， well limited， with irregular contours， hypodense， the seat of diffuse calcifications ， enhanced after injection of iodinated contrast medium ， measuring approxi-mately 82x55mm extended on 162mm. Histopathology showed large cystic spaces lined with endothelium containing red blood cells and proteinaceous fluid. In addition， a fibrovascular con-nective tissue wall was noted. The diagnosis of giant cavernous hemangioma of the distal oesophagus was made. The patient\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Oesophagal hemangioma is a rare benign tumour of the oesopha-gal submucosa . The lower third of the oesophagus is the most affected segment . The oesophagus is the least affected site for hemangiomas in the gastrointestinal tract . The range of pa-tients' ages usually ranges from newborn to 76 years； there is no predilection for sex . Hemangioma is benign vascular prolifer-ation； it is made of numerous cavities of variable size filled withblood and lined by a layer of endothelial cells within the mucosa and submucosa， without signs of malignancy. There are several histological subtypes： cavernous， capillary hamartomatous，and arteriovenous. The cavernous haemangioma is defined by the size of the larger venous channels than capillaries. Clinically， the patient usually presents with dysphagia and hematemesis. Dysphagia may involve both liquids and solids. In addition， other symptoms may be found， such as epigastric pain， ret-rosternal pain， weight loss， and melena . The diagnosis of an esophageal hemangioma is radiological and endoscopic . En-doscopy objectifies a protruding submucosal lesion of blue color and may also appear as a reddish discoloration with normal or ulcerated mucosa . In that case， the submucosa appears pale blue. Barium studies usually demonstrate polypoid intramu-ral growth . On computed tomography CT scan， cavernous hemangiomas of the esophagus appear as a homogenous and isodense mass enhanced after contrast injection， with small cal-cifications or phleboliths . In our case， the CT scan showed a voluminous mass centered on the lower third of the thoracic and abdominal oesophagus， with scattered calcifications. On magnetic resonance imaging MRI， the mass appears isosignal on T1-weighted images and high signal on T2-weighted images. Other atypical features can be found， such as high signal inten-sity of the mass on T1 and T2 weighted images. The main differential diagnoses are： malignant hemangioma， Kaposi’s sarcoma， angiosarcoma and benign metastatic hemangioma . The treatment of choice is endoscopic surgery if the tumour is limited to the mucosa or submucosa.

One of its well known complications is angle closure glau-coma (increased intraocular pressure secondary to physical-ly obstructed anterior chamber angle) . It is debatable whether prophylactic treatment for spherophakia is neces-sary or if treatment should only be performed in symptom-atic patients . We describe an 18-month-old child with bilateral spherophakia complicated by an acute on chron-ic angle closure glaucoma in the right eye. To our knowl-edge， this is the youngest child to be reported with pupillary block secondary to anterior lens dislocation in spheropha-kia. The left eye showed multiple iris atrophic holes that might indicate previous attacks of angle closure， and which might have helped to lessen the severity of a similar attack in the left eye. It seems that early intervention with lensec-tomy and anterior vitrectomy allows for adequate control of the intraocular pressures in patients with spherophakia.\n\n【8】CASE REPORT\n\n【9】An 18-month-old male was referred to our clinic for man-agement of known spherophakia. He had previously been managed with spectacle correction of-24 D sphere in each eye. According to his mother， he was evaluated by an oph-thalmologist 2 months before， who prescribed Timolol 0.5%eye drops twice daily in both eyes for intraocular pressures of 28 mmHg and 26mmHg.\n\n【10】On examination， he was able to maintain an unsteady but cen-tral vision in both eves. He had an esotropia of 40 prism diop-ters (PD) at near and distance， which decreased to 25 PD with his current prescription. He had coarse right horizontal nys-tagmus. Using chloral hydrate sedation， his anterior segment exam revealed bilateral clear comeas， with corneal diameters of 13.00mm horizontally and 12.50mm vertically in the right eye， and 13.25mm horizontally and 12.75mm vertically in the left eye. His right conjunctiva was injected. Before dilatation， the right lens was anteriorly displaced in the shallow anteri-or chamber . The anterior chamber of the left eye was also shallow， with multiple atrophic iris holes . Cycloplegic refraction was - 34 D sphere in the left eve， but was not obtainable for the right eye. His intraocular pressures measured 41 mmHg and 28 mmHg using Perkins tonometer(Haag-Streit， USA). Both posterior poles were normal， with a0.2 cup to disc ratio. Gonioscopy was not done for the patient. He had normal external features and normal limbs. Pediatrics consult to rule out any systemic associations was negative. The patient took Acetazolamide tablets (25 mg/kg/day in 4 divid-ed doses and was scheduled for surgery in 2 days).\n\n【11】Under general anesthesia his right cornea was clear and in-traocular pressure measured 15mmHg and 8mmHg. Upon intraocular manipulation， the lens was repositioned to its anatomical position. Four hours of zonular dehiscence (3-5and 9-11) were noticed. An uneventful right eye lensecto-my with planned anterior vitrectomy was performed. He was kept on Timolol 0.5% BID to the left eye. After discussing the risks， benefits and alternatives with the parents， they chose toproceed with a left lensectomy and planned anterior vitrec-tomy l week later， which was uneventful. Following recovery， his exam revealed bilateral clear corneas and deep anterior chambers. Retinoscopy yielded a refractive error of +13.00 D in the right eye and +12.25+1.25 axis 180 in the left eye. His intraocular pressure was 8mmHg and 7mmHg 2 weeks after the second operation. One year post-surgery there were no complications， he was off antiglaucoma treatment， and was wearing +11.00 D with a +3.00 DS near addition in both eyes.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n\n【13】Chronic angle closure glaucoma secondary to spherophakia with frail zonular fibers has been reported in several ethnic-ities (Japanese， Indian， Nepalese， Australian， etc) . This is the first case to be reported from the Jordanian population. After literature review， this appears to be the youngest child to present with secondary glaucoma follow-ing ectopia lentis. Spherophakia has also been reported in borderline cases of Weill-Marchesani syndrome with ab-sence of some clinical features of the disorder . It also oc-curs in Marfan’s syndrome， Alport’s syndrome， Klinefelter's syndrome， hyperlysinaemia and congenital rubella .\n\n【14】Multiple mechanisms have been discussed to explain the mechanism of angle closure in patients with spherophakia.\n\n【15】These included pupillary block via a spherophakic lens with weak zonules with or without dislocation into the anterior chamber， blockage of the angle by a dislocated lens， irritation of the ciliary body by a dislocated lens， or associated congeni-tal or acquired anomalies of the trabecular meshwork . In the first and second decades of life， pupillary block in dis-orders with lens abnormalities is a well known associationIn our case， the presence of a dislocated crystalline lens in the anterior chamber and the high IOP made our manage-ment decision easier. Following stabilization of the intraoc-ular pressure， a lensectomy was promptly conducted. The peripheral iris atrophy in the left eye may have acted as pe-ripheral iridotomies to limit the pupillary block.\n\n【16】It is debatable whether prophylactic treatment for spheropha-kia is necessary or if treatment should only be performed in symptomatic patients . Furthermore， there is controversy over whether lensectomy alone is enough to control glauco-ma in spherophakia patients. Dagi  and Willoughby  be-lieved that lensectomy is enough to control intraocular pres-sure in such cases if performed in a timely fashion. Asaoka suggests that trabeculotomy may be necessary to control intraocular pressure in spherophakia. Yasar  needed 2 tra-beculectomies in the right eye and l in the left eye， follow-ing bilateral lensectomy，anterior vitrectomy and peripheral iridectomy， to control intraocular pressure in a 16-year-old girl over 5 years of follow-up. Although lensectomy will re-lieve pupillary block， it may not control intraocular pressure in the presence of extensive peripheral anterior synechiae.\n\n【17】Peripheral iridotomies or iridectomies may be good tem-porary measures to control the intraocular pressure until the time of surgery ， although this is challenging in the pediatric population.\n\n【18】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【19】We assume that prompt intervention with lensectomy and anterior vitrectomy allowed for adequate control of the in-traocular pressures.\n\n【20】Literature search\n\n【21】A MEDLINE literature search from 1995 to present using the key words “microspherophakia\"， “Weill-Marchesani syn-drome\"and\"pupillary block\" was completed to look for re-ports on childhood pupillary block， microspherophakia and pediatric subluxated lens management.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Numerous risk factors for the occurrence of falls are known， of which it is crucial to indicate and identify the changing risk factors， those that health professionals can influence. A fall usually occurs when there is a combined effect or the presence of multiple risk factors. Occupational therapy plays an essential role in assessing and reducing the risk of falls. Occupational therapists along with other members of the rehabilitation team， evaluate the risk of falls， design and implement therapy plan.Method： We use case report to demonstrate the influence of rehabilitation on the risk of fall in older person after a stroke. Case report： We present the case of a 73-year-old man after a stroke and with a diagnosis of Right hemiparesis-occupational therapy perspective. The patient was referred for rehabilitation three months after the stroke. Based on assessment， subjective and objective， he is categorized as high risk for fall. During his stay in a rehabilitation facility for four weeks， as a part of a rehabilitation program， he had physical and occupational therapy interventions. The physiotherapist applied occupational therapy approach in assessment and therapy， as there is no educated occupational therapist in Montenegro. Conclusion： Physical and occupational therapy interventions aim to reduce the risk of falls and increase the elderly’s participation in essential activities. This helps people increase their level of independence and maintain dignity and satisfaction in every aspect of life.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS occupational therapy， prevention， falls， interventions， the elderly\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Fall\n\n【4】For most people， the ability to stand， walk， and move are daily activities that are performed without thinking. Fall is not a dis-ease in itself. In older people， falls have dramatic consequences and are often indicative of some pathology. A fall is defined as an unintentional grounding or descent to lower level - not as a result of an intrinsic event such as syncope or stroke or becauseof an extrinsic environmental hazard. Falls are the leading cause of death for people over 75 in the United Kingdom. Tinetti et al. estimated that 30% of people aged 65 years and over 50% of people aged 80 years fall at least once a year. The incidence of falls in people with dementia is twice as high as in people with preserved cognition. Falls often go unreported and unregistered so this information is only indicative. It should also be noted that falls occur in the younger population but the consequences of the fall are far more severe in the elderly. The incidence of falls and the risk of fractures are increasing in institutionalised persons .\n\n【5】The consequences of the fall\n\n【6】The consequences of a fall in older people are devastating. Less than 10% of falls result in a fracture， and one in five falls requires medical treatment. Besides， there are several other consequences of a fall that significantly affect the duration and quality of life(fear of falling， restriction on movement， care facility). Conse-quently， the prevention of falls in the elderly has become a prior-ity in the healthcare system in the United Kingdom and around the world . People with dementia are more likely to have severe fractures with poor recovery prospects and three times higher mortality rates than people with preserved cognition . In the United States， over 800，000 patients are hospitalized annu-ally for the consequences of a fall， most commonly a hip fracture or head injury. Falls are among the 20 most expensive medical conditions. The average cost of an individual hospitalization is more than 30，000 USD. The cost of falling in the United States for2015 is estimated at 50 billion USD. As the US population grows older， the number of falls and consequent costs are expected to increase . The elderly most often fall due to confusion when performing routine， daily activities and walking. Falls are the most common cause of hospitalization after injury and the lead-ing cause of injury leading to permanent partial disability (47%) and complete permanent disability (50%). Falls are the second leading cause of death from an accidental injury in Canada . The annual estimated cost of falls in the elderly population is 2billion USD.  Fall-induced injuries are one of the most com-mon causes of activity limitation， disability and death in the elderly population. Falls are a serious threat to the health and quality of life of older adults. Risk factors typically act togetherto increase a person's fall risk. \n\n【7】There are many risk factors for falls， and only a few are vari-able ones that we can influence. The most important variable risk factors are balance disorder， gait disturbance， muscle weak-ness and medication use. Fear of falling can entail a series of events such as social isolation， loss of function and new falls. About 60% of the falls are the result of a combination of multiple risk factors.\n\n【8】The risk of falling in the elderly living in the community is categorized as：\n\n【9】·High risk -≥65 years， history of falls and the presence of one or more risk factors\n\n【10】·Moderate risk -265 years and the presence of one risk factor\n\n【11】·Low risk -only one risk factor .\n\n【12】Aging\n\n【13】Aging-progressive physiological changes in the body that lead to a decline in biological functions and a decline in the body's ability to adapt to metabolic stress. Aging is a series of pro-gressive changes in the body that increase the risk of disability， illness and death . Physical skills and abilities that change under the influence of normal ageing are postural orientation， postural reactions， instability， rough and fine motor coordina-tion， precision， strength and endurance， walking speed，stride length， stride height and time of response .\n\n【14】Changes that affect sensory structures and functions are prob-lems with vision and hearing. Changes in mental function are sleep problems， cognition， memory， alcohol abuse， depres-sion， anxiety， mental disorders and suicide. Musculoskeletal changes are osteopenia， osteoporosis， osteoarthritis， muscle at-rophy. Cardiovascular changes are changes in blood pressure， pulse， atherosclerosis. In day-to-day activities， changes include incontinence， weight loss， bad teeth， swallowing， feeding， meal preparation， food procurement， personal hygiene，sexual activi-ties， functional mobility， moving aids and falls. When it comes to changes in day-to-day instrumental activities， these include changes in caring for others， community mobility， safety rest and sleep， work， leisure， community involvement， coping，careand wellness .\n\n【15】Numerous studies have pointed to various factors that con-tribute to healthy ageing： genetics， educational level， marital status， family status， work for a living， volunteering， healthy habits， social support， commitment to religion .\n\n【16】In 2017， the global population of people aged 65 and over numbered 962 million， more than double that of 1980 when there were 382 million senior citizens worldwide. The number of seniors is expected to double by 2050 when the population is projected to grow to 2.1 billion. Globally， the number of people over 80 years of age is estimated to have more than tripled from2017 to 2050 from 137 million to 425 million J.\n\n【17】As the elderly population grows， so does the need to provide health services in the form of treatment and care in acute and chronic health conditions. Such predictions are undoubtedly significant for healthcare professionals， especially occupational therapists. Maintaining functional performance in older people can have economic， social and personal benefits for all health care users， their families and society as a whole.\n\n【18】Occupational therapy in fall prevention\n\n【19】Occupational therapy is defined as the therapeutic application of activities of daily living ADL (occupation) in an individual or group to develop and enhance participation in roles， habits and routines at home， at school， in the workplace， in the com-munity and other settings. Occupational therapy services are offered in habilitation， rehabilitation， health promotion and well-ness， for the needs of people with disabilities and related needs. These services include the establishment and preservation of an occupying identity for those at risk of injury， illness， disor-der， condition， impairment， activity limitation or participation restriction.\n\n【20】As most falls occur in and around the home， it is necessary to examine the environmental hazards of both inside and outside the home. The three most common dangers of falling into a home are slippery floors， poor lighting， and obstacles to move-ment. It should be emphasized that the mere presence of danger in the environment is not enough to cause a fall. The interac-tion between the elderly's physical abilities and environmental hazards is more important. It is， therefore， necessary to take into account the older person's ability to judge what activities he or she can perform. Also， it is essential to consider the his-tory of a person with a previously reported fall as a positive、4history increases the risk of a fall . Fall prevention activities are implemented through a range of health disciplines including occupational therapy， physiotherapy， general practice， patient care， geriatrics， gerontological health and social care .\n\n【21】Risk of fall assessment-occupational perspective\n\n【22】Fall prevention guidelines emphasize the need for careful evalu-ation of individual risks and disadvantages. It is also essential to consider the synergistic effect of the associated risk factors. The PEO (Person-Environment-Occupation) model is a useful guidance framework when assessing fall risks .\n\n【23】Postural control assessment tests are recommended for the evaluation of fall risk： Timed Up and test， Functional reach， Berg Balance Scale， Tinetti Balance and Gait Evaluation J.\n\n【24】Effectiveness in falls assesses the degree of confidence， confi-dence a person has while performing the activities of daily living without falling. The FES-I (The Falls Efficacy Scale-International) is an assessment instrument consisting of 16 elements for assess-ing the intensity of concerns about falls while performing morecomfortable and more demanding physical and social activities.\n\n【25】FaB (The Falls Behavioral Scale for Older People) evaluates everyday behaviour， both accidental and deliberate， that pro-vides the elderly with protection from falls .\n\n【26】Occupational therapy interventions\n\n【27】There are two strategies that occupational therapists use the most： skills improvement interventions and environmental in-terventions. Balance， transfer and gait interventions are at the heart of fall prevention programs. The occupational therapist interventions encourage individuals to incorporate exercise into their daily routine. Group exercises can be especially helpful for seniors. By observing their peers when performing the exercises， they can achieve improvement in their reactions and behaviour.\n\n【28】A multi-segment intervention should include the following components： exercises， especially balance exercises， strengthen-ing and walking exercises， modifying the home environment， re-ducing medication - especially psychoactive substances， treating postural hypotension and treating foot problems and appropri-ate footwear. Fall prevention， and more importantly PO， injury and death prevention is possible . Today it is 3D technology and video games are increasingly recognized as a potential means of increasing patient participation in the exercise program. Educa tion is usually part of a multi-segment prevention program and leads to a positive outcome in the form of behavioural change， reduced fear of falling， and increased mobility . Long-time exercise training of 1 year or longer in duration is associated with a reduction in falls， injurious falls and fractures in older adults .\n\n【29】Prevention and intervention strategies must take into account the elderly's health and behaviour in the environment. Home modification refers to the converting or adapting of environ-ments to make everyday tasks easier， increase comfort， reduce the number of accidents， and support independent living. The range of home modification is wide， and expense for such mod-ifications ranges from low-cost adaptations to more expensive renovations. Home modifications may include removing haz-ards (clutter and throw rugs)； adding special features or assistive devices( grab bars and ramps)； moving furnishings to create clear pathways； changing places where activities occur( sleeping on the first instead of the second floor)， and renovating rooms to accommodate disabilities .\n\n【30】Case report\n\n【31】Hamdo， the 73 years old male， retired economist.

Globally， the population aged 65 and over is growing and the prevention of falls is being imposed as national interest in a large number of countries. Occupational therapy plays a huge role in fall prevention. Occupational therapists use a range of evidence-based strategies to identify the risk of falls and to create an individually-tailored， multi-segmented intervention plan. In the absence of available occupational therapists， phys-iotherapists may undertake assessment and treatment of the risk of falls. This paper shows how four weeks of rehabilitation after stroke can improve balance and reduce risk of falls. The interventions aim to reduce the risk of falls and improve the participation of the elderly in essential activities.

Timely recognition and prompt ini-tiation of treatment for PMR are important to avoid prolonged cardiogenic shock； however， the symptoms of PMR are nonspecific， and early diagnosis is often difficult.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 72-year-old woman with nausea for 2 days presented with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction with obstruction of the obtuse marginal branch and 75% stenosis of the first diagonal branch. Percutaneous coro-nary intervention was performed to revascularize the obtuse marginal lesion， which was over thrombolysis in myocardial infarction grade 2 flow. After percutaneous coronary intervention， the patient developed fever， an elevated C-reactive protein level， and an increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). The patient showed no signs of infection but elevated inflammatory marker levels， with C-reactive protein rising to 39.32 mg/dl and NLR to 15.0n postoperative day 4， the patient’s clinical condition rapidly deteriorated， resulting in circu-latory failure. Transthoracic echocardiography showed anterolateral PMR， and urgent surgical mitral valve re-placement was performed. On day 32， the patient was discharged from the hospital， and at the 1-year follow-up， she remained in good health.\n\n【4】Conclusions： When there are multiple lesions， including the obtuse marginal and diagonal branches， anterolateral PMR should be suspected as the cause of cardiogenic shock. Performing point-of-care echocardiography and closely mon-itoring C-reactive protein levels and NLR can be helpful to detect PMR early.\n\n【5】Keywords： Myocardial Infarction · Papillary Muscles ·Neutrophils ·Inflammation\n\n【6】Heart Rupture， Post-Infarction\n\n【7】Papillary muscle rupture (PMR) is a rare， yet life-threatening， mechanical complication of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Acute PMR often results in acute mitral regurgitation， with sub-sequent acute heart failure or cardiogenic shock. Generally， PMR can occur 2 to 7 days after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) . Early recognition of AMl and prompt percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for the resolution of myocardial ischemia significantly reduce the incidence of PMR. Nevertheless， PMR still occurs in an estimated 1% to 5% of patients with AMI， with a high mortality rate， especially in cas-es of complete rupture， which is estimated to reach approxi-mately 50% within 24 h， requiring surgical intervention . However， early diagnosis remains a challenge because of non-specific symptoms and signs. Therefore， development of an ap-propriate strategy for predicting PMR has long been overlooked.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 72-year-old woman presented to the hospital with chest discomfort and cold sweats lasting more than 3 h. She vom-ited 2 days before presenting to the hospital but had no oth-er symptoms.\n\n【10】The patient had a 20-year history of hypertension and was taking amlodipine 5 mg once daily. There was no history of heart disease. Initial vital signs were as follows： blood pres-sure， 167/123 mm Hg； heart rate (tachycardia)， 147 beats/min； body temperature， 36.5℃； and oxygen saturation， 95%in ambient air. Her physical examination was unremarkable.\n\n【11】Laboratory studies showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 16 100/uL (reference： 4000-9000/uL)， with 69.0% neutro-phils， C-reactive protein (CRP) level 2.3 mg/dL (reference：<0.30mg/dL)， brain natriuretic peptide level (236 pg/mL， reference：<18.4 pg/mL)， troponin-1 (24871 pg/mL， reference： <26.2 pg/mL)， creatinine kinase (1173IU/L reference： 49-189 IU/L)， creatinine kinase-MB fraction (125 IU/L， reference：<17 IU/L)， aspartate aminotransferase (169 U/L， reference： 7-38 U/L)， alanine trans-aminase (54 U/L，reference： 4-44U/L)， and lactate dehydroge-nase (549 U/L， reference： 120-220 U/L). Electrocardiography(ECG) showed atrial fibrillation and ST-segment elevation in the lateral leads， with concomitant reciprocal ST-segment depres-sion in the inferior leads and in leads V4-6 . Chest radiography findings were unremarkable. Transthoracic echo-cardiography (TTE) revealed severe lateral wall hypokinesis. A tentative diagnosis of STEMI was made. Emergency coronary angiography showed a non-dominant left circumflex artery， with a complete obtuse marginal branch artery obstruction at just the proximal end with no collaterals and 75% stenosis of the first diagonal branch of the left anterior descending artery. Subsequent PCI was performed to revascular-ize the obtuse marginal branch artery， which was over throm-bolysis in myocardial infarction grade 2 flow .\n\n【12】Outcome and Follow-Up\n\n【13】Serial laboratory tests showed that the value of creatinine ki-nase peaked within a day of PCI . Echocardiography1 h after catheterization showed mild mitral regurgitation， with a preserved left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction of 65%\n\n【14】. On day 2， the patient developed a low-grade fever of 37.5 C. Laboratory test results showed an el-evated WBC count at 24600/uL， neutrophils at 84.9%， and CRP level of 10.7 mg/dL. Although we initially suspected bacterial in-fection and initiated intravenous empiric antimicrobial therapy with ceftriaxone (2 g/day) and vancomycin (0.5 g/day)， repeat-ed blood cultures remained negative. Follow-up laboratory test results on day 4 showed exacerbation of inflammatory response(WBC， 26 300/pL and CRP， 39.32 mg/dl) with a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) of 15， raising concerns about the pos-sibility of secondary mechanical complications . Noappreciable cardiac murmur or leg edema was observed. Follow-up chest radiography revealed flush pulmonary edema， without increased cardiac silhouette. TTE showed hyperkinetic LV con-traction with massive mitral regurgitation caused by anterolat-eral PMR. The rupture resulted in flail anterior mitral valve leaf-let and severe mitral regurgitation. Based on these findings， a final diagnosis of acute mitral re-gurgitation secondary to PMR was made. The patient's clinical condition rapidly deteriorated， resulting in cardiogenic shock requiring infusions of dopamine (7 pg/kg/min) and noradren-aline (0.3 pg/kg/min) and intra-aortic balloon pump support.\n\n【15】Subsequent emergency surgical mitral valve replacement with an Epic bioprosthetic mitral valve of 25 mm (St Jude Medical， Inc， St Paul， MN， USA) was performed to confirm the complete and total rupture of the single main papillary trunk， with almost normal valve leaflets and chordae . The postop-erative course was uneventful. Adenosine-induced stress myo-cardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography(SPECT) confirmed a complete perfusion defect in the antero-lateral wall . She was discharged on day 32 and remained healthy， with a normally functioning prosthetic mitral valve and minimal regurgitation at the 1-year follow-up TTE.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Herein， we report a case of complete anterolateral PMR follow-ing STEMI due to an anterolateral ischemia， which was suc-cessfully treated with surgical mitral valve replacement. Our case provides several important clinical insights.\n\n【18】First， total occlusion of the obtuse marginal branch artery and stenosis of the first diagonal branch caused complete PMR in our case.\n\n【19】It is well known that anterolateral PMR occurs less frequent-ly than posteromedial PMR. This is owing to the difference in the blood supply to the papillary muscle. The anterior papil-lary muscle is often perfused by the first diagonal and obtuse marginal branches. In our case， obstruction of the obtuse mar-ginal and stenosis in the first diagonal branch led to insuffi-cient blood flow to the papillary muscles， which could have caused PMR. Therefore， even a small area of myocardialinfarc-tion due to anterolateral ischemia can cause PMR. The exactpathogenes is of PMR is yet to be elucidated， but it is consid-ered to be multifactorial. As in our case， most cases of PMR had preserved LV function concurrent with small areas of ischemia. corresponding to less than a quarter of the LV . Thus， it is believed that the tear is presumably the result of high shear stress from hyperkinetic LV contraction applied to the vulner-able ischemic papillary muscle. Therefore， the key to prevent-ing PMR is to salvage myocardial ischemia as quickly as possi-ble. According to the ACCF/AHA/SCAl guideline， patients with STEMI and ischemic symptoms for less than 12 h should un-dergo PCI to enhance their chances of survival (class l， level of evidence A) . However， our patient had the following 2concerns regarding delayed PCI. First， the patient did not have typical chest pain at the initial presentation. If nausea were the chief symptom of STEMI， the onset of STEMI may have started the day before admission. A second concern is that ECG find-ings on admission showed ST-segment elevation as well as the onset of small Q waves and negative T waves in the aVL lead， suggesting that the patient might have already passed the hy-peracute phase. Based on these findings， the patient might have undergone delayed PCI of more than 12 h after the on-set of STEMI. Myocardial perfusion SPECT scan following car-diac surgery confirmed irreversible myocardial necrosis， sup-porting this notion. Thus， our case illustrates the difficulty in predicting the exact time of STEMI onset and the importance of suspecting PMR as a cause of acute heart failure in patients with STEMI and anterolateral ischemia.\n\n【20】Second， the CRP level and NLR were useful in predicting the development of PMR in our case.\n\n【21】Primary PCI has remarkably improved the prognosis of patients with AMI. The incidence of mechanical complications has signif-icantly decreased to approximately 1% with PCI . However， once a mechanical complication occurs， the in-hospital mor-tality rate for patients with STEMI remains high (42.4%).The American Heart Association recommends that proper diagnosis and treatment is necessary to shorten the duration of cardio-genic shock and reduce the possibility of death. Additionally， it is important to distinguish post-infarction mechanical com-plications from other causes of heart failure or non-cardio-genic shock . However， early diagnosis of PMR remains ex-tremely challenging because it presents similar findings， such as elevated jugular venous pressure and pulmonary conges-tion. PMR often results in hemodynamically unstable acute mitral regurgitation. Rapid and severe regurgitation causes a rapid increase in atrial pressure. The subsequent pressure gra-dient between the left atrium and left ventricle can often be equalized early， explaining why new murmurs were not audi-ble in our case. In addition， various noises caused by pulmo-nary edema and rapid breathing can obscure the cardiac mur-murs. Silent mitral regurgitation is observed in approximately30% of patients with ischemic mitral regurgitation， which sup-ports this notion . TTE is used as an initial diagnostic tool to identify acute PMR. The pathognomonic echocardiograph-ic finding of acute PMR is the prolapse of the ruptured papil-lary muscle head attachment to the flail mitral leaflet into the left atrium. However， TTE may be not informative in patients with partial PMR or ruptured heads that do not prolapse into the left atrium (up to 35% of cases with acute PMR)， which could be mistaken for a valvular tumor， thrombus， or vegeta-tion . TTE has a diagnostic sensitivity of 65% to 85%. Transesophageal echocardiography is an alternative diagnos-tic modality for such cases， with a high diagnostic sensitivity of 95% to 100% . Prompt medical therapy and emergencysurgery are often required for acute PMR， and all mechanical complications after AMI generally have a poor prognosis； how-ever， among them， PMR has a relatively good prognosis， and early diagnosis and surgery can improve the prognosis . Therefore， the development of a predictive index for the inci-dence of post-infarction PMR has long been awaited. Previous studies have shown a correlation between increased levels of inflammatory markers and cardiac rupture . CRP is an acute-phase response protein that is synthesized in the liver during the acute phase of AMI or infection and is mainly in-duced by cytokines， such as interleukin 6 . The CRP levels reflect the degree of inflammation and tissue necrosis， and cardiac rupture following AMI induces higher levels of CRP. The peak serum CRP levels of >20 mg/dL can be a good pre-dictor of cardiac rupture， with 89% sensitivity and 96% spec-ificity. Elevated CRP levels are also present in cases of exten-sive myocardial infarction； however， a study has shown that levels in these cases are significantly lower than those found in the rupture group .\n\n【22】Furthermore， CRP levels can be a biomarker not only for free-wall cardiac rupture but also for other mechanical complica-tions， such as PMR and ventricular septal defect . Based on previous studies， the pathological images of PMR show find-ings of tissue necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration， which can reflect elevated CRP levels . Simultaneously， cortisol release in response to the extent of tissue necrosis caused by myocardial infarction leads to a decrease in lymphocyte lev-els . Therefore， the combination of high CRP levels and low relative lymphocyte counts can be a marker for a wide range of myocardial tissue necrosis and rupture . NLR has also been reported to be associated with post-PCl mechani-cal complications . Based on these findings， NLR can be a good indicator of mechanical complications following AMI， similar to the CRP level. High levels of inflammatory markers were also useful in predicting the development of PMR in our case. The CRP level increased rapidly 2 days after admission， peaked on day 4， and remained high (39.32 mg/dL) until the day of the rupture. Simultaneously， NLR increased significant-ly the day after admission . In this case， the NLR re-corded the day after admission was 11， notably higher than the reported average NLR of 4.5 within the first 24 h following AMI . As PCI can also cause an inflammatory response，a marked increase in CRP level and NLR on the day after revas-cularization can be a good indicator of the early detection of mechanical complications .\n\n【23】Generally， prediction of PMR occurrence is difficult， even in the presence of conventional risk factors for mechanical compli-cations of AMI， as in our case. A discrepancy between signif-icantly increased inflammatory markers and hyperkinetic LV contraction or less elevated CK levels can be a red flag for PMR following AMl， as per our case .\n\n【24】However， because elevated CRP levels and leukocytosis are also observed in septic shock or infective endocarditis， it is necessary to simultaneously perform serial echocardiographs to identify other foci that can cause fever. Further research and accumulation of data on the relationship between PMR development and time course of inflammatory marker expres-sion are warranted.\n\n【25】This case highlights the importance of careful monitoring with biomarkers to predict post-infarction mechanical complica-tions， even after successful primary PCI， in patients with STEMI.\n\n【26】Conclusions\n\n【27】We report a case of STEMI caused by obtuse marginal branch and diagonal branch ischemia resulting in completeanterolateral PMR that was successfully treated with surgical mitral valve replacement.\n\n【28】Early detection and prompt surgical treatment are directly as-sociated with patient prognosis.\n\n【29】This case highlights the effectiveness of point-of-care echo-cardiography and close monitoring of CRP and NLR for early detection of PMR.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

This report is of a 39-year-old woman with VES treated with emergency cardiac defibrillation followed by multidisciplinary management.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 39-year-old woman， previously diagnosed with eosinophilia of unknown origin and recurrent non-sustained ventricular tachycardias， was admitted to the Department of Invasive Cardiology with VES after an initial anti-arrhythmic approach， analgesia， and defibrillation in the Emergency Department. The patient had a temporary pacing wire implanted， but overdrive therapy was not successful. The medical treatment and multiple defibril-lations did not stop the arrythmia. Due to the hemodynamic instability， extracorporeal membrane oxygen-ation (ECMO) was performed at the Department of Cardiac Surgery. Consequently the patient was stabilized and an electrophysiology exam and RF ablation of arrhythmogenic focus were conducted in the Department of Cardiology. One day after the procedure， the patient had pulmonary edema caused by pericardial tampon-ade. The patient was successfully operated on in the Department of Cardiac Surgery. Then， the next complica-tion appeared - a femoral artery embolism - which was treated in the Department of Vascular Surgery. After patient stabilization and exclusion of serious neurological damage， an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator(ICD) was implanted for secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD).\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】This case has shown the importance of the rapid diagnosis of VES and emergency management with cardiac defibrillation.Multidisciplinary clinical follow-up is required to investigate and treat any reversible causes and to ensure long-term stabilization of cardiac rhythm.\n\n【6】Keywords： Cardiac Tamponade· Case Reports · Catheter Ablation·Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation·Tachycardia， VentricularVentricular electrical storm (VES) is a sustained ventricular ar-rhythmia (VA) recurrent over a short period of time . The most widely accepted definition of VES is 3 or more episodes of sustained VA occurring within 24 h . VES is associated with high mortality in the acute phase and is also an indepen-dent factor which increases morbidity in a 3-month observa-tion . The most frequent triad of factors behind VES are： acquired and congenital predisposal as myocardial scars or hereditary arrhythmogenic syndromes；  autonomic nervous system disorders as increased of sympathomimetic activation or excessive suppression of parasympathetic nervous system； and  triggers such as ischemia， inflammation， hypoxemia， dyselectrolitemia， and toxicosis . Moreover， the factors in-creasing the risk of VES are male sex， a lower ejection frac-tion of the left ventricle， and serious comorbidities . Case reports on VES mainly concern patients with implantable car-dioverter-defibrillator (ICD) where arrythmias were primary treated by a device intervention.\n\n【7】Nevertheless， implantation of an ICD is the ultimate approach in a secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death and does not solve the problem . VES is related with high pre-hospi-tal mortality in patients with VA and cardiac arrest who were not previously diagnosed with serious heart muscle defects. A comprehensive approach to diagnosis and treatment of VES is important. This report is of a 39-year-old woman with VES treated with emergency cardiac defibrillation followed by mul-tidisciplinary management.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 39-year-old woman was admitted to the Department of Invasive Cardiology with VES after an initial antiarrhyth-mic approach， analgesia， and defibrillation in the Emergency Department (ED). The timeline of subsequent events is shown in Table 1. The patient had no history of smoking or abuse of alcohol or drugs. The medical history from the previous year revealed ventricular arrhythmias in the form of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (nsVT) detected by Holter monitoring and eosinophilia of an unknown cause despite in-depth diag-nostics. In the outpatient transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) examination， no valvular defect nor segmental abnormalities of the contractility of the left ventricle were found； the left ven-tricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 65%. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart performed 1 year prior to the events showed neither fibrosis foci nor active and past post-inflam-matory changes， and left ventricular ejection fraction was pre-served. An electrocardiogram (ECG) recorded 3 weeks before the present admission revealed ventricular bigemina . No features related to hereditary electrical disease were foundin normal sinus beats. Additionally， the patient was taking 2.5mg of bisoprolol daily. On the day of admission， the patient was reported to have fainted twice without a complete loss of consciousness， which was the reason for contacting the ambu-lance services. During patient transport， ventricular tachycar-dia with a preserved pulse developed and treatment with bo-luses of amiodarone failed to resolve the arrhythmia. Despite preserved awareness， the patient's condition gradually deteri-orated， and on admission to the ED was defined as moderately severe. Her blood pressure was 96/65 mmHg， Glasgow coma scale (GCS) was 15 points， and the ECG showed monomor-phic ventricular tachycardia 203/min . VT-inducing factors such as drugs， acute cardiac ischemia， and electrolyte disturbances were excluded. Laboratory tests showed no dys-electrolytemia， no inflammation， and no elevated markers of myocardial damage. Subsequently， the coronavirus disease(COVID-19) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was nega-tive. Due to the history of eosinophilia，the number of eosino-phils was checked， and it was normal (210/pl). Only a signifi-cantly increased value of the N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was found . The attempts to ter-minate arrhythmias with amiodarone， metoprolol， lignocaine， magnesium sulfate， and adenosine were unsuccessful. Due to her deteriorating hemodynamic state， the patient was sedated， intubated， and mechanically ventilated. Electrical cardioversion was then attempted 4 times but failed to restore stable sinus rhythm. Then， the arrhythmia turned to ventricular fibrillation(VF)， which required Lund University Cardiopulmonary Assist System (LUCAS) chest compression system-based resuscita-tion； defibrillation was performed， resolving the hemodynami-cally unstable ventricular tachycardia. A decision was made to implant an endocavitary electrode for temporary cardiac pac-ing in the Department of Invasive Cardiology. The patient was transferred to the Intensive Cardiac Care Unit (ICCU)， where al-ternating pulses of pulseless ventricular tachycardia， ventric-ular pacing， and ventricular fibrillation were present. In the TTE examination， no valvular defects were found； LVEF mea-sured 40%. Subsequent attempts at antiarrhythmic treatment， cardioversion， and defibrillation were unsuccessful . After central venous catheter insertion， a vasopressor and positive inotropic amines were administered. An attempt to terminate the arrhythmia with overdrive stimulation was unsuccessful.\n\n【10】Due to the exhaustion of therapeutic options and prolonged resuscitation， the decision was made to provide hemodynamic support with peripheral V-a extracorporeal membrane oxygen-ation procedure (ECMO) in the Department of Cardiac Surgery. No intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was implanted at this crit-ical stage， as it seemed it would not be effective and would only prolong organ ischemia time. IABP is quite applicable with a fairly slow and steady rhythm. However， due to the problem of synchronization with the rhythm in fast VT and VF， ECMOno coronary artery stenosis or anomalies. EPS revealed an ar-rhythmogenic focus on the latero-anterior apical wall of the left ventricle. Additionally， simultaneous ablation of the focus with radiofrequency current was performed . These procedures were performed on continuous mechanical sup-port. After the procedure， the resolution of arrhythmia and re-turn of sinus rhythm were observed. On the first postoperative day， the patient's condition deteriorated again， and she devel-oped pulmonary edema. The TTE showed signs of a pericardi-al tamponade， with LVEF 10% . The pa-tient was once again transferred to the Department of Cardiac Surgery， where the tamponade was decompressed through a median sternotomy， ECMO was recannulated to the central po-sition， and a vent to the left ventricle was inserted. The intra-operative evaluation showed no overt perforation to the free wall of the heart as the cause of the tamponade. The most likely cause of the tamponade was a slight perforation thatcould not be found. After the procedure， the patient's condi-tion stabilized， and the sinus rhythm was maintained. In the TTE study， a gradual improvement in left ventricular systolic function was observed， but her chronic acute kidney injury re-quired temporary renal replacement therapy.\n\n【11】Table 1.

After cardiovascular sup-port， the patient's condition and hemodynamic parameters were stabilized. Laboratory tests revealed features of acute myocardial and renal damage related to prolonged resusci-tation actions， as well as increased inflammatory parametersrequiring empiric antibiotic therapy. The ventricular arrhyth-mia persisted， so the decision was made to perform coronary angiography in the Department of Invasive Cardiology and then an electrophysiological study (EPS) in the Department of Cardiology. Consequently， coronary angiography showed\n\n【15】Table 2.

In the following days， the patient required rehabilitation due to bilateral paresis of the lower limbs. On the follow-up cardiac MRI， left ventricu-lar systolic function returned to nearly normal values， with an EF of 53%， and a focus of hypoperfusion within the basal and middle segments of the anterior wall was observed. An ICD for secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) was implanted. During 1-year follow-up， no episodes of recurrentarrhythmias were noted in the observation of the device at the Outpatient Cardiology Clinic. The patient continued neurolog-ical rehabilitation due to a spinal cord stroke， with impaired walking. Eventually， the patient achieved incomplete physical fitness (she uses a rolling walker)， but returned to her profes-sional career as a teacher.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】In the presented case， successful treatment of the patient was possible due to the efficient cooperation of many specialists from various departments and because our patient with VES was admitted directly to a multidisciplinary hospital with the possibility of using ECMO and catheter ablation.\n\n【21】VES is a dramatic clinical scenario， especially for a patient who has not previously been protected by an ICD . Even with Suc-cessful termination of an arrhythmia，the risk of dying during short-term follow-up is significantly increased， as found in the MADIT-II study . The hazard ratio (HR) for death over the 3months after VES was 17.8 (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\] 8.0to 39.5， P<0.01) compared to the group without VES episodes. Monomorphic VT is the most common type of recurrent ven-tricular arrhythmia (91%)， while VF and polymorphic VT are less common (9%)， based on the data from ICDs analyzed af-ter electrical storms.\n\n【22】Treatment in the acute phase of VES requires the fastest possi-ble termination of arrhythmias and stabilization of the cardio-vascular system with intravenous antiarrhythmic drugs， prefer-ably amiodarone and beta-blockers， and if they are ineffective， with cardioversion/defibrillation . Verapamil should be used when arrhythmia originates from the His-Purkinje system. In this case， verapamil was not used. Sedation is the key to sta bilizing patients with VES， but hemodynamic and/or respira-tory instability may limit the use of sedatives such as benzo diazepines or opioid analgesics (eg， morphine and fentanyl). In such cases， mechanical ventilation with orotracheal intuba-tion is absolutely required in refractory forms of VES. In some cases， mechanical ventilation allows for safer administration of drugs that are otherwise not tolerated. Opioid analgesics， benzodiazepines， and propofol are preferred due to their lower negative inotropic effect . The use of beta-blockers in com-bination with sedation has a positive effect on the release of noradrenaline from the cardiac nerve endings and limiting the arrhythmogenic effect of catecholamines. Sedation， in addition to direct arrhythmia suppression， also allows time to identify reversible causes of VES. If the above treatment is ineffective. electrotherapy is recommended. One way to prevent a recur-rence of arrhythmia is to impose a faster rhythm (overdrive stimulation) than the normal ectopic rhythm using an endocav-itary electrode for temporary cardiac pacing， or in patients with an implanted pacemaker or ICD， using an external programmerfor implantable devices. In the case of VES being resistant to aggressive pharmacological treatment， sedation， electrother-apy， and autonomic modulation can also be used. One of pos-sible techniques which could be used is thoracic epidural an-esthesia (TEA) ， especially in combination with left stellate ganglion block (LSGB) ， and cardiac sympathetic denervation(CSD) . These methods are aimed at reducing adrenergic stimulation by a direct action on the nerve fibers innervating the heart muscle. When conventional treatments for hemody-namically unstable VA fail， use of an intra-aortic balloon pump(IABP) should be considered， which reduces myocardial isch-emia by improving flow through the coronary arteries and at the same time reduces left ventricular afterload and wall stress by facilitating systolic blood outflow. Other circulatory support systems (ECMO， IMPELLA， and a catheter-based miniaturized ventricular assist device) can also be used to improve cardi-ac and circulatory function in recurrent VT/VF episodes . IABP is quite applicable with a fairly slow and steady rhythm. However， due to the problem with synchronization with the rhythm in ventricular arrhythmias， ECMO or IMPELA could be a better solution. In the case of recurrent monomorphic VT， cath-eter ablation (CA) is an effective procedure， which focuses on destroying the area of the myocardium responsible for the de-velopment or consolidation of arrhythmias by using a catheter inserted into the heart. In the case of continuous VT (lasting>50% of the day and recurring despite the use of antiarrhyth-mic drugs or various forms of electrotherapy) ablation is the method of choice. Hemodynamic mechanical support during CA has a relevant role to restore end-organ perfusion . In the present case， it was indispensable to support the cir-culation mechanically. The ultimate form of therapy may be heart transplantation. A flowchart with the algorithm for the management of VES is presented in Figure 4.\n\n【23】The reported mortality risk associated with VES is variable in the literature. A meta-analysis of the available evidence re-ported a 2.5-fold increase in mortality in patients with VES compared with patients with unclustered sustained VA， and a 3.3-fold increase in mortality compared with patients with no sustained VA .\n\n【24】In the present case， we used multiple mentioned treatments for VES. However， we did not use the thoracic epidural anesthesiaand left stellate ganglion block due to the extremely fast course in the first hours， very quick sedation， mechanical ventilation， and LUCAS based resuscitation， which made it impossible to perform the above procedures.\n\n【25】The presented methods of treatment require a highly special-ized center working 24 hours a day. Thanks to a significant commitment of many health professionals， and the efficient coordination of the work of many departments， it was onlypossible to save the patient's life without any serious dam-age to the central nervous system.\n\n【26】Overall， many factors， such as structural heart disease， left ventricular systolic dysfunction， heart failure (HF)， electrolyte disturbances，kidney failure， stress， and male sex， may be re-sponsible for VES . This patient had a medical history of eo-sinophilia of unknown origin. Eosinophilic myocarditis (EM) is a rare disease that is frequently fatal . Hoppens et al  reported a case of eosinophilic myocarditis with palpitations that evolved into VES and death within 4 days. White blood cell(WBC) count， eosinophil count， and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) were in normal， but the autopsy revealed dif-fuse interstitial infiltrates with extensive involvement of eo-sinophils and mast cells throughout the left and right ventric-ular myocardium， consistent with EM. The diagnosis of EM can be difficult and is only made during autopsy . Moreover， peripheral eosinophilia and CRP elevation are absent in more than 20% of cases. There are no proven therapies for EM .\n\n【27】The current case is similar to the one described by Hoppens et al ， in which the patient had ventricular arrhythmia， as described earlier， and eosinophilia of unknown etiology. On admission， there was no evidence of infection or an increased number of eosinophils. Unfortunately， no tissue was collect-ed for histopathological examination during the operation.\n\n【28】A ventricular storm is a serious therapeutic problem. This case report has shown the importance of the rapid diagnosis of VES and emergency management with cardiac defibrilla-tion. Multidisciplinary clinical follow-up is required to investi-gate and treat any reversible causes and to ensure long-term stabilization of cardiac rhythm. Moreover， it is important that patients with VES are admitted directly to tertiary hospitals with ICCU， as there are able to use ECMO support and per-form catheter ablation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Our study aimed to characterize this population of neonates born to SARS-CoV-2 mothers， analyze SARS-CoV-2 antibodies evolution and evaluate these neonates after hospital discharge. Material and Methods： Single-center prospective cohort study enrolling all neonates born to mothers with active perinatal SARS-CoV-2 infection in a tertiary hospital in Portugal from April 2020 to October 2021. Results：There were 3138 deliveries， and 73 neonates (2.3%) were born from mothers with perinatal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Three neonates (4%) had perinatal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Post-discharge follow-up was achieved in 93% (n=68) of neonates. The first call by a physician was performed at a median of 6 days after discharge. During the first appointment， 46%(n=68) of exclusive breastfeeding was found in mothers.\n\n【1】We performed cerebral ultrasound (CUS) in 93% (n=68) of the newborns during the first month of life， and 35% (n=24) of the newborns had nonspecific abnormal cerebral findings. Regarding serology， 55.1% (n=38) of infants had positive anti-nucleocapsid antibodies at the first 24 hours of life. 52.6%(n=20) of these neonates maintained positive antibodies at one to three months of life. There was a significant decrease in anti-nucleocapsid antibodies titer since birth (p<0.001， Wilcoxon signed-ranks test)， except in four neonates， three of them with perinatal SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【2】Conclusion： We describe our experience following neonates born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection after discharge， considering our hospital COVID-19 policies. The findings of this study suggest a limited impact of maternal， perinatal SARS-CoV-2 infection on early neonatal outcomes. Rooming-in mothers and newborns can be safe， as transmission rates of SARS-CoV-2 seem to be low. This article may contribute to a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the neonatal period and its short-time consequences.\n\n【3】KEYWORDS SARS-CoV-2， neonate， perinatal infection， follow-up，antibodies\n\n【4】This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-SA license.\n\n【5】Neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection is rare and can occur by one of three mechanisms： intrauterine infection (transplacen-tal or ascending)， intrapartum infection (transmission during birth/labour) and postpartum infection (through nasal secre-tions， environmental exposure).\n\n【6】There is still a paucity of epidemiological data on neonatal COVID-19. The current evidence also indicates that the average pooled incidence rate of vertical transmission is low， ranging from 5.6 per 10，000 live births ， an incidence of 0.03% ， and an incidence of 16 per 1000 newborns born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection) . Another study demonstrated that30% of cases of neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infections were likely due to vertical transmission， either intrapartum or congenitally and9% of these cases were confirmed vertical infections (3.3% for intrapartum and 5.7% for congenitally transmitted infections， respectively).\n\n【7】The data also suggests that the rate of premature delivery has increased， and the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate is proportionately higher in premature neonates， which appears to be related to premature delivery for maternal reasons rather than an increase in spontaneous preterm labour . Just like the influenza A/PR/8/34(H1N1) outbreak of 1918 (Spanish influenza)， stud-ies in past pandemics suggest that these children face the poten-tial risk of long-term health outcomes and should be followed up.\n\n【8】Also， recent studies propose that neonates with SARS-CoV-2infection require follow-up since it is not yet known whether this virus can cause long-term sequelae such as heart disease， hyper-tension， diabetes， kidney disease and gastric disease and peri-natal complications such as prematurity and low birth weight. In order to understand the impact of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection on the neonate， our department implemented an ambu-latory follow-up program to support families and neonates born to SARS-CoV-2 mothers. Our study aimed to characterize this population of neonates born to SARS-CoV-2 mothers， analyze SARS-CoV-2 antibodies evolution and evaluate these neonates after hospital discharge.\n\n【9】Materials and Methods\n\n【10】We performed a single-centre observational prospective study enrolling all neonates born to mothers with active perinatal SARS-CoV-2 infection in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and Nursery at a tertiary hospital in Lisbon，Portugal， between April 2020 and October 2021. Our study was exploratory to evaluate the neonatal period of newborns from mothers with perinatal SARS-CoV-2 infection after hospital discharge.\n\n【11】All data was obtained from patient records and a coded num-ber was attributed to each participant to secure confidentiality. During our study period， as part of the Portuguese protocol， all pregnant women admitted to the delivery room were tested with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2from both nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swabs. Active perinatal SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined as mothers with a positive NP swab RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 virus between14 days prior to and up to 48 hours after delivery. In addi-tion， we used the classification system for perinatal SARS-CoV-2transmission of the Scandinavian workgroup ：1) congenital infection in a live neonate born to a mother with SARS-CoV-2infection， defined by the detection of the virus with RT-PCR in umbilical cord blood or neonatal blood collected within the first12 hours of birth and 2) intrapartum acquired neonatal infection defined by the detection of the virus with RT-PCR in NP swab at birth (collected after cleaning the baby) and at 24-48 hours of age in neonates born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【12】The delivery room was divided into two circuits： one for pos-itive SARS-CoV-2 women and another for non-infected women. In addition， our hospital isolation practices were updated accord-ing to national and international recommendations. From April2020 to December 2020 (period A)， all neonates from positive mothers were separated and isolated in the NICU in a negative pressure room until discharge. Since January 2021 (period B)， rooming-in was allowed (in an individual room of the obstetric COVID-19 area， keeping the newborn in the crib two meters away from the mother’s bed) if the mother was asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and able to accomplish safety measures(hand and breast hygiene， and use of face mask). Instructions for contact， respiratory and breastfeeding precautions were ex-plained to the mothers.\n\n【13】Maternal sociodemographic data， pregnancy complications， and the presence of symptoms were collected. The clinical spec-trum of SARS-CoV-2 infection in mothers was classified， fol-lowing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  guidelines， as a mild disease (fever， cough， sore throat， malaise， headache， myalgia， anosmia， dysgeusia or gastrointestinal symp-toms， without shortness of breath， dyspnea or abnormal chest imaging)； moderate disease (evidence of lower respiratory dis-ease during clinical assessment or imaging and oxygen satu-ration (SatO2) ≥94% on room air at sea level)； severe disease(SatO2 <94% on room air at sea level， a ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2)<300 mmHg， respiratory rate>30 breaths/min or lung infil-trates > 50%) and critical disease (respiratory failure， septic shock and/or multiple organ dysfunction). Mothers with symptomatic disease were encouraged to pump and bottle-feed breast milk rather than directly breastfeed. Mothers with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infection were encouraged to breastfeed with a mask and practice hand hygiene directly.\n\n【14】Other studied variables included mode of delivery， gesta-tional age， Apgar score， resuscitation at birth， birth weight and head circumference， neonatal symptoms， type of feeding， isola-tion practices， length of stay， laboratory data， and follow-up. All neonates underwent SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with NP/OP swabs in the first 24 hours (h)， and at 48 h of life， SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in umbilical cord blood or neonatal serum in the first 12h of life and SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid antibodies in umbilical cord blood or neonatal serum in the first 24 h of life， repeated between one and three months of age. If asymptomatic， newborns were discharged between 36-48 h after vaginal deliveries and 48-72 h after ce-sarean deliveries. In addition， instructions to reduce the risk of perinatal infection transmission were reinforced.\n\n【15】Follow-up data variables after discharge included post-discharge family member (mother or other)， presence of signs and symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the neonate， time of the first appointment， time of the second appointment， symp-toms in mothers after discharge， type of feeding at the first appointment， type of feeding at the second appointment， time of first appointment with the Family Doctor/Pediatrician， provi-sion of medical and/or emergency services care to the neonate， diagnosis at the emergency room， RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test-ing for other reasons after discharge， need of hospitalization， cerebral ultrasound outcomes， SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsidantibodies collected between one to three months. We also eval-uated medical care support related to breastfeeding or another type of feeding， baby weight gain， umbilical stump care and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling the newborn.\n\n【16】Clinical specimens were obtained following CDC guidelines. NP and OP swabs were inserted into a sterile viral transport medium tube. The serum was collected in a serum separator tube and centrifuged in accordance with CDC guidelines. All specimens were kept refrigerated at +4C. Viral RNA was ex-tracted by bioMerieux NucliSENS easyMag automated system from 200 uL clinical samples and eluted in 50 uL. The Shanghai Fosun Long March Medical Science Co.， Ltd. 2019-Novel Coron-avirus (2019-nCoV) RT-PCR detection Kit targeting the Orflab gene (specific for SARS-CoV-2) and E and N genes (targeting lineage B-betacoronavirus) was used following the manufac-turer's recommendations. The assay included a heterologous amplification system (internal positive control) to identify pos-sible RT-PCR inhibition and to confirm the integrity of the kit's reagents. Blood samples were analyzed using Elecsys@ Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Roche Diagnostics)， an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay for the qualitative detection of antibodies (includ-ing IgG) against SARS-CoV-2 inhuman serum and plasma， using a recombinant protein representing the nucleocapsid (N) anti-gen in a dual antigen sandwich assay format， which favours the detection of high-affinity antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. All laboratory tests were performed in the same laboratory. Accord-ing to their presence or absence， SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid antibodies were described as positive or negative. Antibody titer was also evaluated.\n\n【17】A follow-up program was established as part of routine clinical care for all newborns from mothers with active peri-natal SARS-CoV-2 infection， including medical evaluation (first contact through a phone call after discharge and subsequent medical attendance)，laboratory evaluation (SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid antibodies collected between one to three months of age) and cerebral ultrasound to all these newborns.\n\n【18】Descriptive and bivariate statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 25@， and differences were considered significant at p<0.05. Continuous variables did not show a normal distribution using skewness and kurtosis tests. Therefore， results are pre-sented in the median and interquartile range. Non-parametric Mann-Whitney test and Wilcoxon signed-ranks test were used to compare medians， and the Chi-square test was used to verify the association between two categorical variables.\n\n【19】All mothers gave informed consent for inclusion before par-ticipating in the study. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The ethics committee of the institution approved the study.\n\n【20】Results\n\n【21】Characterization of mothers with SARS-CoV-2 and new-borns\n\n【22】During the study period， there were 3138 deliveries， and 73neonates (2.3%) were born from mothers with SARS-CoV-2 in-fection. Table 1 characterizes SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers and their neonates. We had three cases of perinatal transmis-sion. Case 1 was a 34-week premature newborn from a positive mother with severe COVID-19 disease. The newborn developed severe COVID-19 and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in NP/OP swabs and neonatal blood collected within the first12 hours of birth - classified as congenital infection . Case 2was a 36-week preterm. The mother had mild COVID-19. The newborn was asymptomatic and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2RT-PCR in NF/OP swabs， and neonatal blood collected within the first 12 hours of birth- was classified as congenital infec-tion. Case 3 was a 38-week newborn from a positive mother with moderate COVID-19. This newborn was asymptomatic and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in NP/OP swabs in the first 24h and 48h of life， with a negative RT-PCRSARS-CoV-2 in cord blood and blood- classified as intrapartum acquired neonatal infection.\n\n【23】Table 1.

The prematurity rate in infected mothers was higher (12%， n=8 of 73 neonates) than in non-infected mothers(6%， n=184 of 3065 neonates) (p=0.017， Chi-square test). The most frequent complication in neonates was respiratory dis-tress， and 12%(n=9) of these neonates required supplemental oxygen % (n=3) invasive mechanical ventilation， 4% (n=3) non-invasive mechanical ventilation， 1% (n=1) high flow nasal cannula\\].\n\n【27】Thirteen percent (n=5) of the mother-newborn dyads were roomed-in in period A and 80% (n=20) in period B. In period A， 18% (n=7) of mother-newborn dyad separations were due to the newborn's clinical condition， and the remaining caseswere due to hospital logistics. In period B， 20%(n=7) of mother-newborn dyads were separated due to a maternal or newborn clinical condition unrelated to neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection. The neonate with intrapartum-acquired neonatal infection was born in period B， and the two neonates with congenital infection were born in period A.\n\n| Nnn(%)Room-in Period A Yes n (%)Non(%) Room-in Period B Yes n (%) Non(%)  | 40 533 287  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Breast milk Yes n (%)Non (%) Breast milk period A Yes n(%) Non(%)Breast milk period B Yesn (%)Non(%)  | 49 (67.1)24(32.9) 1424 350  |\n| Length of stayMedian (IQR) daysMinimum-Maximum days  | 3 1-83  |\n| Neonate's laboratory results  |  |\n| SARS-CoV-2 by upper respiratory swab (RT-PCR) in the first 24 hours of lifePositive n (%)Negative n (%) Inconclusive n(%)  | 683(4.4)64(94.1) 1(1.5)  |\n| SARS-CoV-2 by upper respiratory swab (RT-PCR) at 48 hoursPositive n (%) Negative n(%)  | 68 2(2.9)66(97.1)  |\n| SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in blood in the first 12hours of life Positive n (%)Negativen (%) Missingn (%)  | 653(4.6)52 10(15.4)  |\n\n【29】Legend： IQR-Interquartile range.\n\n【30】1Ofthe 29 cesarean sections performed， six mothers had symptoms (one mother with severe symptoms， onemother with moderate symptoms and five mothers with mild symptoms). Only two mothers had COVID-19pneumonia， which was why delivery was performed by caesarean section. All other cesarean sections werefor other reasOms.\n\n【31】Only one 34-weeks premature neonate with congenital SARS-CoV-2 infection presented respiratorydistress. Of the remaining eight newborns with respiratory distress and without SARS-CoV-2 perinataldisease， six neonates also presented sepsis (five neonates were premature and one was full-term) and theremaining two were term neonates.\n\n【32】Due to logistics and hospital policies， all newborns received breast milk in period B， but only 37%(n=14) of newborns were breastfed during period A.\n\n【33】The median length of stay was 3 days. A maximum stay of83 days was verified in a preterm neonate of 28 weeks with no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 perinatal transmission.\n\n【34】In our cohort， we did not find differences between neonates breastfed or fed by formula regarding the severity of maternal symptoms (p=0.261， Chi-square test)， length of stay (p=0.160， Chi-square test) and birth weight (p=0.161， Chi-square test).\n\n【35】Clinical follow-up after discharge\n\n【36】Post-discharge follow-up is described in table 2. Follow-up was achieved in 93% (n=68) of neonates， and none developed disease or clinical symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the neonatal period.\n\n【37】All neonates were discharged with a first appointment sched-uled. Forty-two (62%) neonates were evaluated in the first week after discharge and 54 (79%) were observed during the first 14days after discharge. The three neonates with SARS-CoV-2 peri-natal infection were observed at a median of 7 days after hospital discharge (minimum 4 days， maximum 12 days). The hospital appointment was the first medical evaluation in 80% (n=50) of the cases. One infant was observed in the hospital appointment at 90 days because he missed the first appointment scheduled for the first week of life. All mothers were in self-isolation and remained asymptomatic or with mild symptoms. However theywere encouraged to use a face mask and to perform hand hy-giene during newborn handling.\n\n【38】Table 2.

In addition， seven (20%) mothers reported concerns about feeding difficulties and the baby's weight gain.\n\n【44】Eleven neonates went to the Emergency Room (ER)， and five presented with acute nasopharyngitis. These five neonates had a median of 14 days of life， and three underwent SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR inNF/OF swabs， all with negative results. One of these was neonate case 3 (SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic perinatal infection). In addition， three neonates were observed with poor feeding and failure to thrive， all were exclusively breastfed， and two started infant formula supplementation after medical evaluation.\n\n【45】Laboratory results-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies kinetics\n\n【46】SARS-CoV-2 antibodies kinetics are described in Table 3. Anti-nucleocapsid SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies were evaluated in the first 24 hours of life and reevaluated at the second appointment(between one and three months). We found a significant de-crease in anti-nucleocapsid antibodies titer since birth (p<0.001， Wilcoxon signed-ranks test). Exceptionally， we found an increase of anti-nucleocapsid antibodies titer in four neonates. Three of these neonates had perinatal SARS-CoV-2 infection with no de-tectable antibodies at 24h of life. One became positive on day5 (index 31.6)， another on day 4 (index 20.3) and the other on day 41 (index 9.4). The fourth neonate did not have neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection and was always asymptomatic. He re-vealed positive antibodies at birth (index 23.2) and at day 14(index 24.5)， with an increase in anti-nucleocapsid antibodies titer.\n\n|  | Anti-nucleocapsid antibodies at thefirst 24 hours of life (n=69)  |  | Statistical test  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Group1Positlve (n=38)  | Group 2Negatlve (n=31)  | Statistical test  |\n| Maternal symptomsAsymptomatic n(%) Symptomsn  | 34(89.5)4(10.5)  | 23(74.2)8(25.3)  | p=0.096Chi-square  |\n| Time between maternnl pesitive tcat anddelivery (days)Median (IQR) Minimum-Maximum Gestational age (weeks)Median (IQR) Minimum-Mazinun  | 10-143928-41  | 3928-42  | p=0.703Mann-Whitneyp=0.926Mann-Whitmey  |\n| Perinatal SARS-CoV-2 infectionYes n Non(%)  | 038  | 3(9.7)28(90.3)  | NA  |\n| Newborn complicatione Yes nNo n  | 29(78.4)  | 23(76.7)  | P-0.867Chi-square  |\n| Length of stay (days) Median (IQR) Min1m1im-Maximiim  | 31\\_83  | 31-45  | p=0.104Mann-Whitney  |\n\n【48】Lcgend： NA-Ncn applicablc\n\n【49】Table 5- Mother and newhor characteristics (CUJS)\n\n|  | Abnornal CUS  | Normal CUS  | Statistical test  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Maternal symptonsAsymptomatic n (%) Mild symptoms n (%)Moderate symptomsn(%) Severe symptomsn(%)  | 19(79.1)4(16.7)01(4.2)  | 35(81.8)6(13.6)1(2.3)1(2.3)  | p=0.790，Chi-Square test  |\n| Nconatc Gestational Agc (wecks)Median (IQR)Miimum-Maximurr  | 3828-41  | 3934-42  | p-0.008.Marm-WhilneyTest  |\n| Neonate Birth weight (gram)Meilisn(IQR) Minimum Maximur  | 2812.57204222  | 3327525654370  | p=0.005，Mann-WhitneyTeet  |\n| Preuature neunales n(%)  | 9(13.2)\\*  | 3(4.4)  | NA  |\n| iemmeonares n(%)  | 15\\*\\*  | 41 (603  | NA  |\n\n【51】Legend：IQR-Interquartile range：NA .Non applicable\n\n【52】\\* Abnormal findings in the 9 premature neonates： diffuse white matter injury (n=4). gradeintravextricular hemorrhage (n=2)， lenticulostriate vasculopathy (n=2)， subependymal cysts (n=2).

The antibod-ies titer was not associated with maternal symptoms， the time between a maternal positive test and delivery， length of stay or newborn complications.\n\n【57】Cerebral ultrasound evaluation\n\n【58】As part of our protocol follow-up， sixty-eight newborns (93%) underwent cerebral ultrasound (CUS) evaluation in the first month of life (table 5). There were no statistically significant differences in CUS results of neonates born to symptomatic and asymptomatic mothers (p=0.790，Chi-Square test). Twelve neonates (17.6%) were premature，and 82.4%(n=56) were term. Most premature neonates had abnormal CUS， and most term neonates had normal CUS (p=0.003， Fisher’s Exact Test).\n\n【59】We described our experience following neonates born to moth-ers with SARS-CoV-2 infection after discharge， considering our hospital COVID-19 policies and measures.\n\n【60】During the study period， there were 3138 deliveries， and 2.3%(n=73) of neonates were from SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers. This incidence rate was similar to that of other Portuguese stud-ies that reported an incidence rate of 1.6%(23 in 1438 deliveries) and 4.6%(81 in 1755 deliveries) of incidence of neonates born to SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers .\n\n【61】Hospitalization and maternal and neonate characteristics Most mothers (82%， n=60) were asymptomatic and diagnosed at admission. Twelve percent (n=9 of 73) of neonates were born preterm， which is twice the rate of the one found in non-infected mothers (6%， n=184 of 3065)， statistically significant (p=0.017). These findings are described in the literature and suggest that although pregnant women do not seem to suffer from a more se-vere disease than the general population， SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy might be related to an increased risk of preterm birth， mainly due to a maternal condition .\n\n【62】In our cohort， a C-section was performed in 40% (n=29 of73) of the deliveries， which was higher than in the non-infected women group (29%， n=889 of 3065)，p=0.06. Separation of moth-ers and infants during the postpartum period negatively af-fects maternal-infant bonding and breastfeeding . However， based on the evidence， rooming-in and skin-to-skin contact ap-pear safe with droplet and hygiene precautions . Un-fortunately， for logistical reasons， we could not accommodate mothers and newborns until January 2021. Furthermore， since we achieved conditions to room-in (period B)， we have seen the benefits for the mother-newborn dyad， including on breastfeed-ing rate (100%， n=35). In any case， we reinforce that the room-in and room-out variables present differences in incidence， which may interfere with these results.\n\n【63】We also know that the approach to SARS-CoV-2-positive preg nant women in our country was different from centre to centre at the beginning of the pandemic. A Portuguese study that evalu-ated 24 different hospitals between April and May 2020 reported that 61% of neonates were separated from their mothers， and70% were not breastfed. There are also literature reports that describe breastfeeding rates that go as low as 17% and as high as 86% . In our sample， breast milk was given to 67%(n=49) of the neonates. Although we considered that some mea-sures applied throughout the pandemic in our hospital， such as not allowing skin-to-skin contact at birth and mother-newborn separation， may have harmed the outcomes such as breastfeed-ing， we also considered that encouraging mothers to extract breast milk through a milk pump might have had a positive impact on breastfeeding.\n\n【64】Maternal self-report by phone also allowed us to have a good follow-up and avoid unnecessary in-person visits that would place patients and healthcare professionals at risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Therefore， telemedicine was seen as a pragmatic solution. The first phone call by a physician was performed at a median of 6 days after hospital discharge. This median agrees with the follow-up recommendations for a neonate from a positive SARS-CoV-2 mother .\n\n【65】After discharge， we followed 93% of neonates (n=68)，and none was hospitalized or had SARS-CoV-2 documented infec-tion. Most mothers (67.1%， n=49 of 73) were exclusively breast-feeding during hospitalization. After discharge， exclusive breast-feeding was found in 68% (n=46 of 68) of the mothers duringthe first appointment and 61% (n=37 of 61) during the second appointment. Our protocol follow-up was important to promote and support breastfeeding mothers.\n\n【66】According to Latorre G. et al. ，lockdown and home con-finement decreased exclusive breastfeeding. Pacheco F. et al. also reported that COVID-19-positive mothers may face clinical impediments to breastfeeding. On the one hand， there is limited professional support during the first days after birth to help parents deal with negative experiences. In addition， social distancing measures impair the familial and social environment that supports the parents’ journey. On the other hand， mothers previously not planning to breastfeed may have changed their plans because the pandemic increased their time at home and their awareness of the role of breastfeeding as a protective mea-sure. Studies also suggest that telemedicine consultation during outbreaks， considering the risks of SARS-CoV-2 transmission， allowed healthcare workers to decrease the concern of families and reduce indiscriminate ER access. As described in the previ-ous articles ， telemedicine consultation made it possible to support most mothers. However， unfortunately， in 16% of cases， we could not prevent infants from going to the ER because we could not perform a physical examination during a telephone appointment. One of our study limitations was that we carried out medical appointments by phone and not by video call due to technical issues. Although all neonates remained asymptomatic on follow-up， as we did not perform repeated SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests during the isolation period， we cannot ensure that perinatal transmission was not higher.\n\n【67】Laboratory results\n\n【68】To date， few articles in the literature explore antibody kinetics in the neonatal period. Studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 antibod-ies are transferred from an infected mother to her neonate during the third trimester through the placenta . In our sample， most infants (55.1%，n=38) had positive anti-nucleocapsid anti-bodies in the first 24 hours of life. Although most infants main-tained positive antibodies for at least three months， we found a decrease in the anti-nucleocapsid antibodies' median titer from birth to 1-3 months of age (p=0.000， Wilcoxon signed-ranks test). Antibody titer tended to decrease over time， but as expected， it did not happen in the three neonates that presented perina-tal SARS-CoV-2 infection， probably related to their antibody production in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and not just transplacentally passive transference of maternal antibodies.\n\n【69】Further studies are needed to determine whether the mother's infection severity or time of infection influences the infant's antibody titer. A study by Mo H. et al.  revealed that neonates infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the second trimester of pregnancy had a longer duration of detectable IgG than neonates born to women infected during the third trimester.\n\n【70】We also point out that laboratory techniques for determin-ing antibodies (index determination， in our center) are different between centres； therefore， it is difficult to compare different studies. We emphasize the importance of standardizing method-ologies to facilitate the interpretation of results in the future.\n\n【71】Cerebralultrasound\n\n【72】We found that most neonates with abnormal CUS had lower birthweight and lower gestational age， and prematurity can explain cerebral abnormal findings. On the other hand， in 22.1%(n=15) term neonates， abnormal cerebral findings were found，and we could not justify these findings with complications，low birth weight or maternal symptoms. Furthermore， we found no relation between mother symptoms and severity and CUS alterations.\n\n【73】We also reinforce that we found abnormal CUS in the two neonates with SARS-CoV-2 congenital infection. However as we do not yet know the long-term impact of these cerebral abnormal findings， we believe that these infants should be followed up with long-term neurodevelopmental assessment.\n\n【74】To date， we did not find in the literature any study on ul-trasound cerebral findings in neonates born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unfortunately， there are also few publica-tions about the neurological effects of SARS-CoV-2 in neonates， and studies have small sample sizes. Yan K. et al.  de-scribe cranial MRI changes， namely white matter changes， in four neonates with COVID-19. Engert V et al.  describe a case of a premature neonate with intracranial bleeding and periventricular leukomalacia as a potential consequence of post-COVID-19 hyperinflammation during pregnancy. Larger and longer-term multicentric studies are urgently needed to clar-ify the impact of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection on the CNS and neurodevelopment.\n\n【75】Limitations of our study include the small sample size， the fact that we did not discriminate IgM and IgG SARS-CoV-2 anti-bodies in all newborns and also the fact that we only included mothers with active perinatal SARS-CoV-2 infection (between14 days prior to and up to 48 hours after delivery). Also， other possible implications could have been studied， such as the im-pact on cardiac function/structure， kidney or gastrointestinal affection. Long follow-up of these children is also needed. In the future， we would like to conduct a similar study to focus on the structural or functional role of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS and its impact on an infant's neurodevelopment.\n\n【76】Conclusion\n\n【77】Although one of the risks of perinatal SARS-CoV-2 infection is prematurity due to maternal illness， the findings of this study suggest a limited impact of maternal， perinatal SARS-CoV-2 in-fection on early neonatal outcomes. We also found that rooming-in mothers and newborns can be safe， as transmission rates of SARS-CoV-2 seem to be low.\n\n【78】We reinforce the importance of following these infants after discharge. We believe this article may contribute to a better understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection in the neonatal period and its short-time consequences. Given the reduced number of neonates with perinatal SARS-CoV-2 infection， we also stress the importance of multicentric studies. More clinical and epi-demiological studies with larger cohorts are needed in order to develop evidence-based clinical guidelines.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The etiology of desmoid tumors is unknown. It is often as-sociated with conditions such as familial adenomatous polyposis and Gardner syndrome.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】We report the case of a 69-year-old man who presented to our hospital with an acute pulmonary embolism. The patient had a past history of colic surgery for a polyp with a high-grade dysplasia. Pulmonary angiography showed partial occlusion of the right superior lobe artery and partial occlusion of the middle lobe artery. The pa-tient was given thrombolytic therapy. Abdominal computerized tomography revealed a mesenterial giant mass with compression of the inferior vena cava (IVC). A biopsy of the mass， confirming aggressive fibromatosis.\n\n【4】A laparotomy was performed， which revealed a massive growth occupying the abdomen and attached to the previous ileocolic anastomosis. One day after surgery， his condition deteriorated.\n\n【5】Conclusions：\n\n【6】This report underlines the potential of imaging investigations of abdomen and vena cava if pulmonary embo-lism is suspected， especially when there is no evidence of peripheral venous thrombosis or other predisposing factors. Unfortunately， data on the surgical management of desmoid tumor is scarce. Therefore， the standard of treatment is a surgical resection for resectable tumors.\n\n【7】MeSH Keywords： Fibromatosis， Abdominal· Fibromatosis， Aggressive· Pulmonary EmbolismA desmoid tumor， also referred to as aggressive fibromatosis， is a rare benign tumor but has highly locoregional aggressive potential arising from a proliferation of fibrous tissue， with an incidence of 2-4 per million per year and a slight female preponderance. It has no known etiologic factor； however， it is associated with certain familiar syndromes such as famil-ial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) . Other risk factor include：previous trauma， prolonged estrogen intake， and previous sur-gery. Desmoid tumors can localized in a variety of anatomic sites： abdominal wall， retroperitoneum， and extremities with a high aggressive potential of adjacent structures.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 69-year-old-man was admitted into our unit through the emergency room for a suspected acute pulmonary embolism. The diagnosis was confirmed by pulmonary angiography， which showed partial occlusion of the right superior lobe artery andpartial occlusion of the middle lobe artery. The patient had a medical history of tuberous sclerosis， a right colectomy for a polyp with a high-grade dysplasia， prostate cancer， and chron-ic constipation. He reported no history of abdominal trauma or prior venous thromboembolic event.\n\n【10】On admission the patient was stable and abdominal exami-nation revealed a mobile abdominal mass involving the en-tire right abdomen. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed an intraperitoneal heterogeneous， tissular mass(20x11x16)， arising from the mesentery， involving the duode nojejunal angle， and the inferior vena cava was severely com-pressed .\n\n【11】The inferior vena cava was dilated and showed no laminar thrombi distal to the obstruction. The patient was given throm-bolytic therapy followed by heparin administration for 3 weeks. A biopsy of the mass confirmed the aggressive fibromato-sis. The patient was prepared for surgery. A laparotomy was performed and confirmed the large mesenteric mass involv-ing the proximal jejunal region and the ileocolic anastomosis. No lymph nodes or ascites were seen. No focal le-sion was noted in the liver. The mass was resected with a part of the adherent jejunal and cholic segment， using linear GIA stapler anastomosis. The postoperative course was compli-cated by a fatal acute myocardial infarction and the patient died on post-operative day 1. The microscopic and immuno-histochemical findings were compatible with the diagnosis of an aggressive mesenteric fibromatosis  (the tumor was positive for vimentin and to beta-catenin).\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Fibromatosis (or desmoid tumor) is an uncommon but high-ly aggressive group of benign tumors arising from fascial or musculoaponeurotic tissues， including mesenteric fibromato-sis . Fibromatosis comprises 0.03% of all tumors， with a slight young adult preponderance and no identifiable etiologic factor. It is， however， associated with familiar syndromes such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) .\n\n【14】A possible genetic predisposition may be implicated， especial-ly in patients with Gardner’s syndrome having a high poten-tial for developing mesenteric fibromatosis compared with the normal population. Most of the patients are clinically asymp-tomatic and the symptoms are associated with progressive in-vasion of contiguous structures and organ compression .\n\n【15】In 2007 Koh et al. published their experience and reported 5mesenteric fibromatosis patterns： 1) spontaneous regression pattern，2) stable pattern，3) variable growth pattern， 4) pro-gressive growth pattern， and 5) aggressive growth pattern .\n\n【16】They found that 75% of all patients had a progressive growth pattern necessitating early surgical treatment . Because of the rarity of desmoid tumors and the unavailability of data ontheir surgical management， there are neither specific guidelines nor a standardized therapeutic approach to its management.\n\n【17】Therefore， curative surgical resection remains the standard of treatment for resectable tumors . Preoperative biopsy is recommended for differential diagnosis with intestinal car-cinoma， carcinoid tumor， mesenteric fibromatosis， lymphoma， and retroperitoneal fibrosis .\n\n【18】Radiotherapy is indicated for unresectable or recurrent tumors. Acute pulmonary embolism due to compression of the infe-rior vena cava related to mesenteric fibromatosis is very rare. Few cases of pulmonary embolism caused by gastrointestinal disease appear in the literature .\n\n【19】In this report the patient died and the origin of the thrombo-sis was the tumor itself. This report underlines the potential interest of imaging investigations of the abdomen and vena cava if pulmonary embolism is suspected， especially when there is no evidence of peripheral venous thrombosis or oth-er predisposing factors .\n\n【20】Conclusions\n\n【21】Mesenteric fibromatosis is usually asymptomatic and presents with a variety of clinical features . The physicians should be suspicious when a pulmonary embolism is present with-out evidence of deep vein thrombosis or other predisposing factors. Consequently， therapeutic strategies should be spe-cifically tailored for each patient and their unique presenta-tion according to anatomic location .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

However atypical imaging findings such as contrast enhancement in the acute setting can be misleading in patients with underlying disease that may have similar imaging features.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】We report three cases of acute PRES with mixed patterns of contrast enhancement on MR imaging. Each patient had an underlying pathology that could have similar imaging features， thereby potentially confounding the diagnosis of PRES (leukemia， metastatic disease and vasculitis).\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】Rapid diagnosis of PRES is essential to prevent complications such as infarction and hemorrhage. Proper diagnosis requires careful attention to the clinical and radiographic presentations. Although the MRI features of PRES are often highly characteristic， knowledge of atypical imaging features-such as acute contrast enhancement or unusual patterns of edema-is essential in preventing misdiagnosis. This is especially true in patients with an underlying disease process that may have similar imaging appearances.\n\n【6】Key words：\n\n【7】Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES)·MRI· Hypertensive EncephalopathyPosterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome(PRES) is a diverse clinico-radiologic syndrome with characteristic clinical presentations and MRI features. PRES is most commonly diagnosed in patients who experience acute hypertensive crisis， are solid organ or bone marrow transplant recipients on immuno-suppressants， are pre-eclamptic or eclamptic， have autoimmune disease or severe inflammatory renal conditions such as glomerulonephritis . The typical imaging findings include vasogenic edema involving the white matter of the parietal and occipital lobes(posterior circulation)， occasionally associated with areas of restricted diffusion. These areas of restricted diffusion often normalize with prompt treatment， however， they can progress to acute infarction if the diagnosis is delayed. The typical clinical presentation is new onset seizure， mental status change/encepha-lopathy， headache， and/or visual change-often in the setting of an acute hypertensive crisis. The term，“Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome”continues to be used in medical literature and practice due to its descriptive nature of the typical imaging and clinical findings that occur in a very heterogeneous group of patients， with heterogeneous etiologies.\n\n【8】Prompt diagnosis is essential to avoid complications such as infarction and hemorrhage. However， in the absence of clinical information， the MR diagnosis of PRES can occasionally be confusing. This is especially true in cases of acute PRES with less common MRI\nfeatures such as vasogenic edema in atypical locations(frontal lobes， deep gray structures， brainstem)，and contrast enhancement in the acute setting without infarction or hemorrhage. We present three cases of acute PRES with atypical imaging features (mixed patterns of contrast enhancement during the acute presentation) in patients with the following underlying pathologies： 1.)relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia(AML)； 2.) metastatic breast cancer； 3.) vasculitic glomerulonephritis and chronic renal failure. In all three cases， the pattern of contrast enhancement could be misdiagnosed as disease progression or a complication related to the patient’s underlying diag-nosis (leptomeningeal carcinomatosis， metastasis and vasculitis， respectively) if imaging occurred without knowledge of the acute clinical scenario.\n\n【9】CASE REPORT\n\n【10】Case 1：\n\n【11】A 28-year-old female presented with an acute exac erbation of her chronic graph-versus-host disease of the skin and liver. She was 179 days status post allo-genic bone marrow transplant and induction chemo-therapy for relapsed AML， with a normal therapeutic level of tacrolimus. She had a stable baseline hepatic encephalopathy. During her hospitalization， she ex-perienced a 2-minute period of unresponsiveness with upper extremity and facial twitching. Her blood pressure following the seizure was 148/108 mmHg. Her baseline blood pressure was a systolic range of106-140 mmHg， with a diastolic range of 63-86 mmHg. MR imaging was performed approximately 2-hours following her seizure which showed symmetrically increased T2W/FLAIR signal within the cortex and subcortical white matter of the occipital， parietal and frontal lobes . There was corresponding nodular leptomeningeal contrast enhancement in the occipital， parietal and frontal lobes. There were no acute infarcts and no intracranial hemorrhages. The MRI findings were consistent with acute PRES. Her tacrolimus was discontinued and her blood pressure was stabilized and carefully monitored. Follow-up MRI several days later showed resolution of the T2W/FLAIR abnormal signal and resolution of the nodular leptomeningeal contrast enhancement. There were no delayed infarctions or hemorrhages. CSF analysis showed no evidence of recurrent AML.\n\n【12】Case 2：\n\n【13】A 66-year-old female presented to the hospital with history of breast cancer and known metastasis to the thoracic and lumbar spine. She was originally treated in 1991 with a right lumpectomy， axillary lymph nodedissection， radiation therapy and hormonal therapy for 5 years. She was admitted for a decompressive laminectomy secondary to her spinal metastasis. Medications included oxycodone， morphine， docusate， aspirin， and metoprolol. During her post-operative recovery， she experienced a tonic-clonic seizure during a hypertensive crisis with a maximum systolic pressure of 210 mmHg. MRI was performed approximately6 hours following her episode and showed multiple areas of increased T2W/FLAIR signal involving the occipital， temporal， parietal and posterior frontal lobes. There were no acute infarcts and no intracra-nial hemorrhages. There was cortical and trace lepto-meningeal contrast enhancement overlying the areas of abnormal T2W/FLAIR signal， consistent with acute PRES，presumably from her hypertensive crisis. Her blood pressure was stabilized and carefully monitored. Follow-up MRI three days later showed a decrease in the abnormal T2W/FLAIR signal and resolution of the abnormal contrast enhancement. There were no late on-set infarctions or hemorrhages.\n\n【14】Case 3：\n\n【15】A 71-year-old male presented with an acute exacerba-tion of chronic renal failure from pANCA vasculitic glomerulonephritis. His medical history included hypertension that was well-controlled. During his hospitalization， he started dialysis and immunosup-pressive therapy (solumedrol， prednisone， and cyclo-phosphamide). He then developed cortical blindness following a witnessed seizure. MRI was performed within 1 -2 hours following his acute presentation to evaluate for cerebral infarction. The scan showed a fairly symmetric pattern of increased T2W/FLAIR signal involving the posterior occipital， parietal and posterior frontal lobe subcortical white matter， with patchy involvement of the overlying cortex . There were no acute infarcts or intracranial hemor-rhages. There was prominent cortical/sub-cortical and trace leptomeningeal contrast enhancement in the regions of abnormal T2W/FLAIR signal， con-sistent with acute PRES， presumably secondary to a hypertensive crisis and/or cyclophosphamide ex-posure. There was no retrospective documentation available to assess for an acute hypertensive crisis. MR venogram， permeability and perfusion stud-ies were all normal. His blood pressure was closely monitored and he had a significant reduction in his cyclophosphamide dosage. Follow-up examination 10days later showed interval development of sub-acute infarction within the bi-parietal and bi-occipital lobes with corresponding contrast enhancement. These sub-acute infarctions occurred after the acute clinical and imaging presentation，consistent with sub-acute PRES complication.\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n\n【17】Typical clinical and imaging features：\n\n【18】Poster reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is clinically characterized by headaches， altered mental status，seizures， cortical visual disturbance， nausea and vomiting . Predisposing conditions include： an acute severe hypertensive episode (an acute hyperten-sive episode relative to the patient’s baseline blood pres-sure)； cyclosporine/immunomodulator medications (ta-crolimus， interferon-alpha， cisplatin， cylophosphamide)； eclampsia/pre-eclampsia； chronic renal insufficiency； hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocyto-penic purpura； and autoimmune disorders .\n\n【19】Highly characteristic neuro-imaging features include abnormal increased T2W/FLAIR signal， thought to be vasogenic edema， primarily within the whitem+1atter of the posterior circulation territories with typical sparing of the calcarine and paramedian re-gions of the occipital lobes . The frontal/temporal white matter may be involved as well as gray matter structures such as the cortex and basal ganglia . Contrast enhancement has been described in the literature， however most of the reported contrast enhancement is secondary to complications such as subacute infarction .\n\n【20】A recent review of the imaging patterns and lesion distribution in PRES in 136 patients defined five major clinical subgroups and three major MR im-aging patterns (not including一 partial or asymmetricvariations) . The five major clinical subgroups in-cluded： 1) postinfection， sepsis， or shock associated with multiple organ dysfunction； 2) posttransplanta-tion (cyclosporine or FK-51cyCIOSPOr06) neurotoxic syndrome；3) postchemotherapy； 4) autoimmune diseases； and5) eclampsia . The three major imaging patterns included：  holohemispheric， superior frontal sulcal， and  dominant parietal-occipital . Within this series， the typical posterior-only pattern (dominant parietal-occipital) was observed in only 22.1% of pa-tients. However， an additional 22.8% of patients had the holohemispheric watershed pattern， with vasogenic edema involving the parietal and occipital lobes in the typical pattern with anterior extension into the frontal lobes. Nonetheless， the “typical”posterior pattern oc-curred in less than 50% of cases. Twenty-seven percent of cases had a distinct involvement of the frontal lobes. with varying degrees of parietal and occipital involve-ment. Partial or asymmetric variations of these three patterns occurred in 27.9 % of their study population. The authors reported 19 cases (out of 88 available studies performed with IV gadolinium contrast) show-ing stippled cortical enhancement corresponding to the areas of vasogenic edema. However， they did not report on how many of these cases also had con-current infarction or hemorrhage that could explain the abnormal contrast enhancement.\n\n【21】The authors of this study did not find a statistical correlation of the maximum blood pressures during the acute phase， the underlying clinical associations or the imaging patterns . Reversal of the vasogenic edema was not statistically different among the clini-cal categories or the imaging categories. No single clinical group or imaging pattern was associated with a greater risk of infarction or hemorrhage. The authors did not comment on which clinical groups or imaging patterns were more likely to have abnormal contrast enhancement.\n\n【22】In an effort to improve radiologic detection and ac-curacy， many authors have demonstrated additional imaging features associated with PRES. Some authors report that ADCvalues on MRI are helpful to distin-guish between those patients that are likely to reverse and those that may progress to infarction； higher ADC values are considered more likely to reverse. MRI perfusion results have been varied， with some authors showing no change in the cerebral blood volume (CBV) or in the mean transit time (MTT). Other authors show decreased CBV， decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF)， and variable MTT in the affected areas . MRI permeability examinations have failed to show any significant change in perme-ability . Diffusion-tensor MR imaging (DTI) in acute PRES showed significant increased isotropic diffusion coefficient and significant decreased anisot-ropy in the affected areas . Follow-up DTI showed reversal of the elevated isotropic diffusion and partial recovery of the anisotropy loss .\n\n【23】In our series， all three patients had a“holohemispheric watershed pattern” with complete or near-com plete reversal of the vasogenic edema upon follow-up imaging in cases 1 and 2. The only “atypical\"imaging characteristic in our three cases was the abnormal contrast enhancement associated with the underlying vasogenic edema， without concurrent infarction or hemorrhage--herein is the potential diagnostic chal-lenge that could arise without the knowledge of the acute clinical presentation. The nodular leptomeningeal contrast enhancement in case 1， along with the cortical and subcortical FLAIR signal abnormalities， could be misdiagnosed as multifocal metastatic leukemic masses infiltrating the leptomeninges. In case 2， the cortical and leptomeningeal contrast enhancement， along with the corresponding FLAIR signal abnormalities， could be misdiagnosed as cortical and leptomeningeal metastatic breast cancer. In case 3， the cortical/subcor-tical and leptomeningeal contrast enhancement， and FLAIR signal abnormalities， could be misdiagnosed as acute CNS vasculitis. The clinical and radiographic differential diagnosis of PRES is vast， however has been organized by Servillo et al.  into 5 broad categories：CNS vasculitis， acute or subacute neurological disorders(ranging from ischemic stroke to infectious encepha litis)， mitochondrial diseases， CNS collagen diseases， and hypoglycemia/hyponatremia .\n\n【24】As previously discussed， ADC values may provide additional prognostic clues to the potential revers-ibility of PRES. Unfortunately in our cases， each MRI was performed in different MRI scanners at different institutions without standardized ADC values. Therefore a comparison of ADC values could not be performed in our small sample. Evaluation ofthe ADC values may have been most helpful in the third case， since this patient proceeded to cerebral infarction. DTI may have a similar predictive ability as the ADC values to predict cases that are likely to progress to infarction. MR perfusion may also help predict cases that may infarct as well as help identify the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism of PRES. Nonetheless， MRI perfusion is likely less helpful in the acute clinical setting， given the increased imaging time required and the heterogeneity of the perfusion findings in PRES (likely due to the variability in etiol-ogy of PRES). Regardless， MR perfusion and DTI may not be available in many institutions， or is not a part of the standard brain imaging protocols\n\n【25】Etiology：\n\n【26】There are two primary hypotheses regarding the pathophysiology of PRES， the vasogenic edema theory and the cytotoxic edema theory . The vasogenic edema theory suggests that excessive elevation of the mean arterial pressure overwhelms the normal cerebral autoregulation (which is more fragile in the posterior circulation)， leading to arteriolar vasodila-tion and endothelial cell dysfunction .Ultimately， there is a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier with capillary leakage causing vasogenic cerebral edema. Elevated ADC values， increased isotropic diffu-sion and decreased anisotropy values， which may all be reversible， support the vasogenic edema model. Studies showing no significant change in per-meability do not support this model .\n\n【27】The cytotoxic edema model suggests that acute hy-pertensive episodes cause cerebral vasoconstriction leading to cerebral ischemia， endothelial cell damage and ultimately cytotoxic edema . The MRI perfu-1171sion studies support this model .\n\n【28】There is a wide spectrum of pre-disposing factors and disease processes that can cause PRES. A singleunifying theory regarding its pathogenesis has been elusive， with anecdotal evidence supporting both the vasogenic and cytotoxic models. Contrast enhance-ment is the result of a breakdown in the blood-brain barrier， which is thought to be associated with both models.\n\n【29】Given that PRES occurs in such a heterogeneous group of diseases and has a heterogeneous collection of pre-disposing conditions， it is our opinion that both the vasogenic edema and the cytotoxic edema models have merit. Regarding our cases， we do not have any specific imaging findings that would favor one model over the other. It is our opinion that identification of the precise pathophysiologic etiology is not the most critical task in the evaluation of acute PRES. especially since both proposed mechanisms result in similar clinical and imaging patterns. In fact， it is impractical to perform rigorous MRI studies such as perfusion imaging and DTI in the busy clinical setting and in these acutely sick patients. Even the admin-istration of contrast-agents is increasingly becoming restricted due to risks of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis(NSF)， and the pressures of cost-controls in medical imaging. Additionally， the treatment of PRES is the same for all patients and all imaging patterns. In cases with hypertension， the mean arterial blood pressure should be lowered approximately 25% within the first hour of acute symptoms， with continued gradual reduction over the next 24 hours . In all cases， it is essential to discontinue or severely reduce the medications that are associated with PRES \n\n【30】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【31】Atypical imaging features， such as an unusual pattern of vasogenic edema or abnormal contrast enhance-ment， can be present in acute cases of PRES . Awareness of the diverse clinical and radiographic presentation of acute PRES is essential to avoid misdiagnosis and treatment delay.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "16dceeb1-b8b2-4483-aac8-f89c3635173b", "title": null, "text": "【0】ABSTRACT Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) does not uncommonly affect the alimentary tract but rarely affects the vermiform appendix. Patients with known lymphoma and clinical presentations of acute appendicitis should be treated with an appendicectomy and early referral and discussion with haematology； however， consideration should be given to other differential diagnoses， including the proliferation of disease. A 51-year-old male presented with clinical appendicitis on a background of known SLL， he had been due to commence chemotherapy， but this was withheld due to the coronavirus pandemic. He was found to have elevated lymphocytes， and cross-sectional imaging showed an enlarged appendix with periappendiceal inflammation as well as bulky mesenteric， retroperitoneal and inguinal lymphadenopathy. He underwent an uncomplicated appendicectomy， and histopathological analysis identified SLL with periappendiceal inflammation. Following this， the patient was deemed suitable to undergo chemotherapy during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Appendicitis， Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma， COVID-19\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Small lymphocytic lymphoma， a B-cell lymphoma， usually presents with generalised lymphadenopathy， organomegaly or lymphocytosis on the peripheral blood film. It is known to have extranodal involvement in different organs， including the prostate and lungs. Non-Hodgkins lymphomas are known to have extranodal spread to the alimentary tract preferentially，but lymphoma of the vermiform appendix is uncommon. COVID-19 has affected the way that all medical conditions are treated， particularly those that involve the use of immunosuppression. The desired effect is to prevent patients from contracting COVID-19 or having more severe versions ofthe illness. However， the effects of not commencing treatment must be considered， and this case highlights the importance of balanced decision-making.\n\n【4】Case presentation\n\n【5】A 51-year-old male from southeast Asia presented to the ter-tiary hospital emergency department with a 3-day history of right-sided lower abdominal pain. He described the pain as sharp with no radiation. It worsened with movement， flexing the patient's right hip and taking deep breaths. He did note some night sweats over the preceding 3 days. He denied any alteration of his bowel habit. The patient’s past medical history was significant for SLL which was diagnosed in 2015 when he presented with submental lymphadenopathy for which he un-derwent an excisional biopsy. He was not on any treatment for this condition at the time of presentation/referral but had been planned to commence fludarabine， cyclophosphamide and ritux-imab (FCR) chemotherapy 2 months prior to this admission due to the progression of the disease. This was withheld due to the COVID-19 pandemic and concerns regarding inducing immuno-suppression in patients in a semi-elective setting. His lymphoma symptoms had worsened in the preceding 6 months with weight loss， night sweats， thrombocytopenia and mild haemolysis. The patient is a non-smoker who does not drink alcohol. He works in a hotel that was being used to quarantine travellers from abroad as part of the COVID-19 response in Australia.\n\n【6】On examination， the patient’s vitals were within normal lim-its， and he was afebrile. He was found to have tenderness in the right upper quadrant and flank with localised rebound and guarding.\n\n【7】Investigations\n\n【8】He underwent baseline investigations in the emergency de-partment， including a full blood count， urea and electrolytes(UEC)， liver function tests (LFTs)， C-reactive protein (CRP) and Haemoglobin A1c. His white cell count was 22x109/ L， with a lymphocyte count of 15， platelets of 93 and normal haemoglobin levels. His CRP was elevated at 83mg/L， and his HbA1c wasalso elevated at 17.2%. His UEC and LFIs were normal.\n\n【9】Given his background history and no convincing clinical diagnosis，he underwent a CT abdomen with intravenous con-trast， which showed a subhepatic appendix distended up to12mm with surrounding periappendiceal inflammatory change； there were small periappendiceal and subhepatic fluid collec-tions. This was suspicious for acute appendicitis. Also of note， there was hepatomegaly， mild splenomegaly and bulky， exten-sive mesenteric， retroperitoneal and inguinal lymphadenopathy， similar to prior imaging.\n\n【10】Differential diagnosis\n\n【11】The initial history and examination pointed to a differential of an acute intraabdominal inflammatory process likely related to the biliary tract， appendix，ascending colon or appendix. This was supported by his elevated white cell count and C-reactive pro-tein. Malignancy of the gastrointestinal tract was also a consid-eration， given the patient’s age profile and constitutional symp-toms. Due to diagnostic uncertainty， the CT was performed， which led to a most likely differential of acute appendicitis；. However， the presence of extensive mesenteric and retroperi-toneal lymphadenopathy did mean that the progression of SLL was considered as another differential， but this did not change\n\n【12】Treatment\n\n【13】The patient was admitted to the Acute Surgical Unit， treated with intravenous antibiotics， and underwent a laparoscopic appen-dicectomy. This was undertaken， and the patient was found to have an inflamed subhepatic appendix without perforation. See images： Postoperatively， he recovered well and was discharged on day one following review by the endocrinology team， who commenced the patient on oral hypoglycaemics for the manage-ment of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\n【14】The operating team reviewed his histopathology report， and he was found to have a small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (SLL/CLL) involving the appendix and the periappendiceal tissue. No evidence of high-grade transfor-mation was identified. There was focal periappendicitis without any evidence of acute appendicitis. In addition， sheets and large nodules of small round lymphocytes also involving the subserosa， normal appendiceal mucosa and sparing of the mus-cularis propria were noted.\n\n【15】Following this， a multidisciplinary discussion was held in-volving pathology， haematology and surgery teams， the out-come of which was that the patient would be recommended PSto undergo chemotherapy with FCR. As a result of his clinical presentation and the presence of periappendiceal inflammation， his lymphoma had been upstaged. Therefore， the patient was reviewed in the haematology outpatient clinic and commenced the recommended treatment.\n\n【16】Outcome and follow-up\n\n【17】The patient recovered fully from his laparoscopic appendicec-tomy and commenced appropriate chemotherapy for his SLL. He had a good response to treatment and is currently being followed as an outpatient for his lymphoma.\n\n【18】25 eyes of 19 patients were managed with surgery.11(58%) were female， and 8(42%) were male with an average age of73.78 years of age range 65-85 years. Age and gender charac-teristics are shown in table 1. Of 19 patients， 6 had bilateral entropion， and 13 had unilateral entropion. There were no complications throughout the procedure. However， one pa-tient developed a slight wound infection after surgery due to poor cleanliness， which was afterwards treated with antibiotics. The treatment was overall successful(88%). One eye showed failure， and two eyes were undercorrected.\n\n【19】Discussions\n\n【20】A male patient in his fifties presented with abdominal pain on the background of known SLL not undergoing treatment； imaging showed significant peri-appendiceal inflammation as well as mesenteric lymphadenopathy. The patient underwent a laparoscopic appendicectomy， the histology of which showed an SLL. As a result， the patient was commenced on appropriate chemotherapy， which prior to this had been withheld due to concerns related to inducing immunosuppression during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n【21】Appendiceal neoplasms are detected in 1% of appendicec-tomy specimens； this incorporates primary appendiceal neo-plasms， secondary disease from other colorectal neoplasms and， as in this case， lymphomas. Primary appen-diceal neoplasms comprise neuroendocrine neoplasms， goblet cell adenocarcinomas， colonic-type adenocarcinomas and signetcell adenocarcinomas. Most are detected after appendicectomy as clinical and radiological features are similar to appendicitis. If an appendiceal neoplasm is considered a likely intraoperatively diagnosis， current management guidelines advise proceeding with appendicectomy as planned， with special care taken to prevent spillage of contents， particularly in mucin-containing le sions. All appendicectomy specimens should be sent for histopathology. If a neoplasm is detected， the case should be discussed at a multidisciplinary meeting， with consid-eration given to performing a right hemicolectomy.\n\n【22】The gastrointestinal tract is the most common site of extran-odal lymphomas， making up 40% of all extranodal lymphomas； most of those are found in the stomach and small bowel. The pathogenesis for this is thought to be due to the large amounts of lymphatic tissue within the bowel wall. This also makes the appendix a com-mon site for lymphomas， given its large amount of lymphatic tissue. Most gastrointestinal lymphomas are of B-cell origin， sim-ilar to this case. However， they are predominantly diffuse large B- cell Lymphomas (DLBCL) and marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. Small lymphocytic lymphoma， the manifestation of chronic lym-phocytic leukaemia (CLL) within the lymphatic tissue， is less frequently encountered in extranodal tissues than in other lym-phomas. In most cases where SLL presents with gastrointestinal complications， it has undergone Richters transformation to DL-BCL； however， cases where SLL has not undergone Richters transformation， are uncommon. Previous clinical manifestations of SLL within the GIT reported in the lit-erature include large bowel obstruction， coli-tis， and colonic perforation.\n\n【23】Small lymphocytic lymphoma is staged using the Lugano classification， which considers the number and location of in-volved lymph nodes and the presence of extranodal disease. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia is ns. staged using the Rai and Binet systems， incorporating lympho-cytosis， anaemia and thrombocytopenia on the patients' blood film. This case would be considered Lugano stage IV， Binet B and Rai I due to extranodal disease. Most early-stage patients are managed with a “watch and wait for approach\". Indications for treatment in patients with SLL in-clude evidence of Rai III or greater， symptoms or the progression of lymphadenopathy or cytopenia. Treat-ment options vary and depend on genetic risk， patient factors and treatment goals. Initial studies from the COVID-19 pan-demic highlighted that patients with haematological malignan-cies had twice the mortality risk from COVID-19 than those without. As a result， the Haematology Society of Australia and New Zealand (HSANZ) released a consensus statement in early 2020 advising that patients who have early-stage disease consider delaying planned initiation of treatment where possible； they also recommended early cessation of treat-ment once disease control has been achieved(di Ciaccio et al.，2020)\n\n【24】The presence of acute inflammation of the periappendiceal tissues requiring appendicectomy indicated that the patient was having functional or symptomatic extra-nodal disease， which no longer placed the patient in the early-stage disease criteria and therefore suitable to commence chemotherapy. This case presents an interesting point where an acute surgical presentation changes the clinical course of a chronic\n\n【25】Learning points/take home messages 3-5 bullet points\n\n【26】· A broad range of differential diagnoses must be considered in patients presenting with acute abdominal pain on the background of lymphoproliferative disorders.\n\n【27】·Histopathological assessment of the appendix is a crucial step and must be performed in every specimen to ensure appropriate follow-up can be performed.\n\n【28】· COVID-19 has altered the criteria for the treatment of many conditions.

While approximately three-quarters of all cases present as localized disease， the rate of metastatic disease has been increasing. Common sites of met-astatic prostate cancer include regional lymph nodes， bones， and lungs. In this case report， we discuss a man with a history of low-risk prostate cancer who developed a testicular mass， which was ultimately diagnosed as a solitary testicular metastasis.\n\n【2】Case Report： An abnormal nodule on the left apex area was identified on a digital rectal exam of an otherwise healthy\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】67-year-old man in February 2008. The patient underwent an ultrasound-guided transrectal biopsy of the pros-tate gland in April 2008. The biopsy demonstrated adenocarcinoma of the prostate， Gleason 6 (3+3)， with tu-mor present in 3 out of 12 submitted cores in up to 20% of biopsy specimens. Following treatment， his pros-tate cancer remained quiescent for several years. He was also found to have a urethral bulbar stricture that required dilation； during the procedure， a nurse detected an abnormality in the right testicle while prepping the patient. A follow-up testicular ultrasound in September 2020 identified an abnormal heterogeneous area with calcifications within the right testicle. Following radical right orchiectomy， pathology revealed metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma， acinar type， with lymphovascular invasion present at the spermatic cord margin. Surveillance for prostate cancer following treatment， even for low-risk disease， should always be continued. Although rare， recurrence and metastasis can occur in patients with low and even absent post-treatment pros-tate-specific antigen levels.\n\n【5】Keywords： Prostatic Neoplasms · Testicular Neoplasms · Testis · Prostate-Specific Antigen·\n\n【6】Physical Examination\n\n【7】The testis is seldom the site of metastatic carcinoma， rep resenting 1.6% of all testicular neoplasms in surgical speci-mens . Prostatic adenocarcinoma is among the most likely origins for secondary testicular carcinomas， representing al-most half of all cases. Other reported sites include renal cell and urothelial cell carcinoma . Notably， primary non-Hodg-kin lymphoma ofthe testis is the most common testicular tu-mor for men over 60 .\n\n【8】Of all non-cutaneous cancers， prostate cancer is the most common in men. While metastatic prostate cancer is uncom-mon， with approximately three-quarters of all prostate can-cer cases presenting as localized disease， prostatic adeno-carcinoma metastases are most likely to occur in the lymph nodes， bones， and lungs， and the rate of metastatic disease has been increasing . In this case report， we discuss a man with a history of low-risk prostate cancer who developed a testicular mass， which was ultimately diagnosed as a solitary testicular metastasis.\n\n【9】Case Report\n\n【10】The patient is an otherwise healthy 67-year-old man that was found to have clinically localized prostate cancer in 2008. At the time， yearly PSA testing and digital rectal examina-tion (DRE) were recommended for men 50-70 years old that opted for prostate cancer screening， the evidence for which was later outlined by the American Urologic Association in2009 . His serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was3.3 ng/mL at the time of diagnosis， but DRE revealed a left-sided firm 1 cm nodule at the base. His biopsy showed 3 cores of Gleason score 3+3 disease， for which he was treated withproton therapy 3 months later. From 2008 to 2019， his annu-al PSA check remained less than 0.2 ng/mL. No images were obtained at the time of diagnosis in 2009 due to his low-risk disease. During this time， he developed radiation cystitis， ure-thral stricture， and low-grade non-invasive urothelial carcino-ma of the bladder. While he was being prepped by the op-erating room nurse for a cystoscopic dilation of his urethral stricture in 2020， a right testicular mass was detected. Scrotal ultrasound  was performed thereafter， showing a 5.5x3.5×2.5 cm heterogeneous testis mass with internal cal-cifications. Testicular tumor markers were negative. He un-derwent radical orchiectomy， and pathology showed prostat-ic adenocarcinoma， acinar type， with lymphovascular invasionpresent at the spermatic cord margin . PSA was 0.34 ng/ml， and a fluciclovine PET/CT scan showed no other areas of disease. The patient is healthy with more than a 10-year life expectancy. He elected for the most efficacious treatment for his metastatic castration-naive prostate cancer. The best long-term results are seen combining androgen de-privation therapy (Leuprolide 45 mg intramuscularly every 6months) and androgen signaling inhibitor treatment (apalu-tamide 240 mg orally daily). This treatment will continue as long as his PSA continues to respond appropriately. His most recent PSA was <0.014 ng/dl in October 2021， and he con-tinues to do well\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level has been a pow-erful metric for the diagnosis and prognosis of prostate can-cer since the 1980s ， but it should be considered among other factors. Typically， recurrence for prostate cancer would be detected by a rising PSA. In a report on patients with bio-chemical progression after radical prostatectomy， the average PSA level of those with positive bone scans was 61.3 ng/mL(range， 1.3 ng/mL to 123 ng/mL) . A multicenter prospec-tive study of 213 patients with biochemical recurrence (BCR) found the diagnostic capacity of fluciclovine PET/CT for pros-tate cancer recurrence to be broadly proportional to prescan PSA， with a 31% detection rate in patients with PSA levels be-tween 0 and 0.5 ng/mL and a 79% detection rate in patients with PSA greater than 1.0 ng/ml . In other words， the high-er the PSA， the easier it is to detect prostate cancer recurrence through PET. As such， physical examination was vital to the detection of recurrence in the present case.\n\n【13】Testicular metastasis from primary prostate cancer is very rare- out of 1539 autopsies on men older than 40 years with pros-tate carcinoma， 35% reported hematogenous metastases， with only 0.5% of all observed metastases to the testis . Although rare， metastasis can occur in the setting of very low or even undetectable PSA. Out of 4091 prostate cancer patients treat-ed at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1999 and2004， only 46 patients presented with metastatic cancer de-spite PSA levels less than 2 ng/ml ； of those， 22% had un-detectable PSA. The most common sites for metastasis were bone， liver， and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Interestingly， most of these patients were asymptomatic， similar to the reported patient. Risk factors in the study mentioned above， however， were absent in the current patient. These included a Gleason score greater than 7， atypical histologic variants， particular-ly small cell and ductal cancers， and locally advanced tumors. Metastatic prostate cancer， absent these risk factors， not to mention metastasis to the testicle， is extremely rare. The capac-ity of regular physical examination without specific indicationsto identify what would have been a life-threatening disease underscores its importance in clinical practice.\n\n【14】According to a recent meta-analysis， there are no other report-ed cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma with a Gleason score of6 and PSA level <1 at diagnosis of testicular metastasis . Prostate cancer recurrence despite low concomitant PSA lev-els may be explained by a clonal shift in the original tumor， which could lead to the proliferation of dedifferentiated pros-tate cancer cell lines that have lost the ability to produce PSA.\n\n【15】The occurrence of prostate cancer metastasis to the testicle is limited to case reports， with fewer than 200 described in the literature . As mentioned， the testicular abnormality was not noted by the patient； it was detected serendipitously during the prep for urethral stricture dilation. Due to the cur-rent patient's low-risk cancer at the time of treatment and low PSA following treatment， the literature suggested that imag-ing and physical examination were unnecessary because dis-ease progression was not found to increase in the absence of increasing PSA . Moreover， guidelines suggest cancer diag-nosis of testicular masses should be based on imaging or bio-chemical markers rather than biopsy . Our current case is a reminder that there are always exceptions. Physical exams can detect abnormalities even in what is considered a low-risk prostate cancer patient.\n\n【16】PSA velocity， or the change of PSA level over a given time in-terval， is widely considered during the identification of pros-tate cancer. It is strongly associated with the diagnosis of pros-tate cancer  as well as recurrence aftertreatment . Aside from the abnormal exam， the current patient did have 1additional， albeit subtle， abnormality-although his PSA level remained very low， the most recent value prior to metastat-ic disease had started to increase from 0.110 to 0.341 ng/dL. This change was the most significant increase between post-treatment PSA values.\n\n【17】Conclusions\n\n【18】Nonroutine examination detected a case of metastatic pros-tate cancer that would not have been detected by convention-al biochemical monitoring. Surveillance for prostate cancer fol-lowing treatment， even for low-risk diseases， should always be continued. Although rare， recurrence and metastasis can oc-cur in patients with low and even absent post-treatment PSA.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It carries a poor prognosis at the time of diagnosis.\n\n【1】Case Report：\n\n【2】A 37-year-old patient with a history of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and thyroiditis presented with syn-cope and hypovolemia. ECG showed non-specific T wave inversions in the lateral leads with no signs of isch-emia. Laboratory investigations revealed deranged coagulation parameters with prolonged prothrombin time(PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and follow-up factor assays revealed severe factor X de-ficiency. A transthoracic echocardiogram and subsequent cardiac MRl showed signs of cardiac amyloidosis. Bone marrow biopsy was consistent with AL amyloidosis， demonstrating period acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive ad-ipose deposits and interstitial infiltration by clusters of lambda restricted plasma cells with aberrant expres-sion of CD 56 and CD 117.\n\n【3】The patient was treated with bortezomib， cyclophosphamide， and dexamethasone， but died early during his treatment due to cardiac arrest， suspected to be secondary to conduction abnormalities caused by cardiac infiltration.\n\n【4】Conclusions This case represents a novel pattern of disease in AL amyloidosis with cardiac， thyroid， and hematological in-volvement as a result of systemic amyloid deposition.\n\n【5】Our report highlights the need for physicians to be aware of cardiac amyloidosis-related complications and the morbidity and mortality associated with concurrent hematological involvement in these cases.\n\n【6】Keywords： Amyloidosis ·Cardiomyopathy， Restrictive·Factor X Deficiency\n\n【7】Amyloidosis is a group of disorders which occur due to pres-ence of misfolded protein depositions in various organs. These proteins are found normally in the body， but excess produc-tion or reduced filtration causes the formation of insoluble fi-brils extracellularly， resulting in damage to the affected tis-sue or organ .\n\n【8】Amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis is the most common type. It is a systemic disease caused by the depositions of light-chain proteins in the kidneys， heart， and the liver， among other or-gans， but it does not typically involve the central nervous sys-tem. Light-chain proteins are generally produced by the mono-clonal proliferation of plasma cells， either as a primary disorder or in association with plasma cell neoplasms such as multiple myeloma and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia .\n\n【9】The clinical presentation of AL amyloidosis includes constitution-al symptoms such as fatigue， weight loss， and poor appetite， in addition to organ-specific symptoms. The most commonly af-fected organs in AL amyloidosis are the kidney and the heart， with the typical presentation being that of heart failure as a result of infiltrative heart disease. It is considered that cardi-ac disease， when present， is the main prognostic factor for pa-tients with systemic amyloidosis， and it carries a poor progno-sis， with survival of less than 3 years . Amyloid depositions within cardiac tissue can affect the conduction system； particu-larly if present in the sinus node and bundle branches， this can result in various types of arrhythmias and conduction blocks. The presence of cardiac arrhythmia has been linked to sud-den death in patients with cardiac amyloidosis with abnormal echocardiogram and complex ventricular arrhythmia on ECG .\n\n【10】Renal disease most commonly presents with nephrotic syn-drome， which may progress to end-stage failure； other mani-festations include congestive heart failure， restrictive cardio-myopathy， peripheral neuropathy， orthostatic symptoms caused by autonomic dysfunction， macroglossia， hepatic infiltrative disease， and carpal tunnel syndrome .\n\n【11】AL amyloidosis can also result in bleeding tendency through several mechanisms： hepatic infiltrative disease， nephrotic syndrome， vascular damage secondary to amyloid deposition， platelet dysfunction， or factor X deficiency. A degree of factor X deficiency is seen in up to 14% of patients， with severe de-ficiency reported in 5% of cases. This deficiency is acquired and it is thought to be caused by the consumption of factor X by amyloid fibrils . In fact， bleeding diathesis predisposes patients with AL amyloidosis to be at a high risk when under-going procedures required to confirm the diagnosis， such as renal and bone marrow biopsy， and thus need frequent cor-rection of the coagulation abnormality.\n\n【12】We present the case of a middle-aged man who presented with signs of conduction abnormality and thyroiditis， found to have severe factor X deficiency， with later confirmation of a diagnosis of AL amyloidosis.\n\n【13】Case Report\n\n【14】A 37-year-old man from Pakistan with a history of hyperten-sion presented to the Emergency Department with loss of con-sciousness following a 20-day history of palpitations， upper abdominal pain， and recurrent vomiting. Systemic review was notable for dizziness on standing， hoarseness of voice， and 7kg of unintentional weight loss over the preceding month. There was no history of chest pain， sweating， abdominal pain， bleed-ing， or seizures. One year prior， the patient had been investi-gated under the care of Cardiology for chest pain and palpita-tions. His ECG had revealed a Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern， and thyroid function studies and ultrasound were consistent with hyperthyroidism secondary to thyroiditis . At the time， he was treated initially with propranolol and then carbimazole when his thyroid function failed to improve. He received regular outpatient follow-up and had reported im-provement of his symptoms.\n\n【15】On presentation he appeared diaphoretic and ill and was not-ed to have postural hypotension. Physical examination revealed a tender hepatomegaly of 4 cm under the costal margin and right lower-limb swelling in the thigh. Initial laboratory investi-gations showed leukocytosis， mild normocytic anemia， throm-bocytosis， and elevated troponins. A coagulation profile dem-onstrated a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) of 29 s (normal range： 9.4-12.5 s)， an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.9， and an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 43 s (nor-mal range： 25.1-36.5 s). He was initially suspected to have sep-sis and was treated with intravenous hydration and antibiotics， with good response. An ECG showed non-specific T wave inver-sions in leads V2-V5 without any ischemic ST-T segment chang es， with Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern， similar to the ECG done l year before. A Doppler ultrasound of the right lower limb was negative for deep venous thrombosis. A transthoracic echocar-diogram revealed severe， concentric biventricular hypertrophy with an ejection fraction of 56%， left ventricular septumend-di-astole was 1.5 cm， and strain analysis showed severe reduction in global longitudinal strain (GLS) of 8.8% with apical sparing.\n\n【16】Hypovolemia was corrected and cultures were subsequently negative， but the patient's coagulation parameters failed to improve. A mixing study led to correction of the PT and aPTT， suggesting a clotting factor deficiency， and a follow-up assay of clotting factors revealed severe factor X deficiency with a level of 7.3% (normal range： 70-120%). Mild deficiencies were also present in factor VII (54%) and factor IX (62%).\n\n【17】The patient was investigated for malignancy as a cause for ac-quired factor deficiency. An iodinated contrast enhanced com-puterized tomography (CT) scan of the neck，thorax， abdomen， and pelvis revealed thyroid enlargement， bilateral pleural effu-sion， and widespread lymphadenopathy in the cervical， hilar， mediastinal， and upper abdominal regions. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed mesenteric and retroperitone-al lymph nodes with mild to moderate uptake， and the other previously visualized lymph nodes did not show any significant activity. In the absence of any obvious malignancy， the patientwas investigated for infiltrative disease. ECG-gated，gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed diffuse subendocardial and mid-anteroseptal heterogenous en-hancement. There was circumferential myocardial hypertrophy and mild pericardial effusion. These findings were in keeping with infiltrative cardiac disease . MRI of the liver showed no signs of infiltrative liver disease， and liver enzymes were normal.\n\n【18】Serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) showed polyclonal increase in gamma globulins， and immunofixation revealed free lambdalight-chain. Serum lambda free light-chain (LaFLC) was high at978.3 mg per liter， serum kappa free light-chain (KaFLC) was36.2 mg/L， with kappa-to-lambda ratio of 0.04， and urine was positive for Bence Jones protein (0.1 g/L). The patient under-went fat pad biopsy plus bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of suspected light-chain amyloidosis. He required high doses of prothrombin concentrate to correct his coagulopathy before these procedures.\n\n【19】At the time of the bone marrow collection， a complete blood count (CBC) showed mild normochromic normocytic ane-mia (hemoglobin 12.6 g/dL， normal range： 13-17)， leukocy-tosis (12.0×10/pL， normal range： 4-10)， and thrombocytosis(526×103/pL， normal range： 150-400)， with rare circulating plas-ma cells noted on screening of the peripheral smear.\n\n【20】Bone marrow (BM) aspirate was hypercellular with active tri-lineage hematopoiesis and showed increased plasma cells with uneven distribution， scattered and in clusters， with an aver-age of approximately 20%.\n\n【21】The plasma cells were morphologically abnormal， with many showing clearing of a large part of the cytoplasm， with deep condensed peripheral staining. Many cells appeared granu-lated with immunoglobulin inclusions (Russell bodies) and a few contained binucleated or pleomorphic nuclei .\n\n【22】Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry on the bone mar-row aspirate revealed 3% of monotypic plasma cells express-ing CD38， CD138 with cytoplasmic lambda light-chain restric-tion， and aberrant CD56 and CD117 expression. The plasma cells were negative for CD19， CD20， and CD45. Flow cytometry showed <1% residual polytypic plasma cells， positive for CD19and negative for CD56 and CD117， with a kappa-to-lambda ra-tio of 1.2. Four percent of B cells expressed CD19 and CDwith a Kappa/Lambda ratio of 1.38， with no immunopheno-typic evidence of a monotypic B cell population .\n\n【23】Bone marrow biopsy was cellular to mildly hypercellular when adjusted to the patient's age， with an average cellularity of 40-50%. There was trilineage hematopoiesis and interstitial in-filtration with scattered clusters of lambda restricted plasma cells as highlighted by immunohistochemistry aberrantly ex-pressing CD56 & CD117 . The infiltration was roughly estimated at 20-30% of the core cellularity. The sec-tion showed a deposition of a pink， amorphous， waxy-look-ing deposit， in the thickened blood vessels wall， mainly with-in the adipose tissue， with some focal interstitial deposits. The deposited material-stained pink to red by Congo red on standard light microscopy and produced a characteristic apple green birefringence under polarized light， consistent with am-yloid deposition . The deposits stained positive for periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and amyloid P . The compiled findings confirmed bone marrow involvement by plasma cell neoplasm resulting in AL amyloidosis. Fat pad biopsy was not diagnostic.\n\n【24】The patient spent the whole duration of his work-up as an in-patient. The Cardiology and Hematology teams were involved early during the hospital stay. His right leg swelling， which was initially associated with pain， resolved spontaneously with-in 5 days of admission. But later， he complained of shortness of breath that was worse when lying flat， which was investi-gated with a transthoracic echo， described above. As his co-agulation parameters failed to improve， the patient's home carbimazole therapy was stopped due to suspicion of carbim-azole-induced coagulopathy. On day 20 of admission， after a pan CT and PET were unrevealing， the patient underwent abdominal fat pad biopsy and bone marrow biopsy in sepa-rate sittings， and both required prothrombin concentrate toachieve proper coagulation. A multidisciplinary team meeting was held， and the decision was made to resume his carbim-azole due to persistent tachycardia， which was suspected to be due to hyperthyroidism.\n\n【25】Later， a bone marrow biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of plasma cell dyscrasia resulting in AL amyloidosis， and he was trans-ferred to the local specialized cancer hospital for initiation of chemotherapy.\n\n【26】In summary， the patient was managed as a case of systemic AL amyloidosis secondary to plasma cell neoplasm manifesting with infiltrative heart disease， severe factor X deficiency， and possi-ble thyroid involvement. The hepatomegaly was considered to be more due to cardiac hepatopathy than to amyloidosis. A thy-roid or liver biopsy were not done due to high risk of bleeding.\n\n【27】On day 27 the patient developed tachypnea that was attribut-ed to heart failure. This was managed with diuretics and con-tinuation of his previous thyroid medications. He was started on bortezomib， cyclophosphamide， and dexamethasone che-motherapy. He continued to have tachycardia， with ECG show-ing sinus rhythm with non-specific T wave changes， so he was started on metoprolol， with a plan for ablation at a later date. A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated a severe drop in ejection fraction over 4 weeks， with an ejection frac-tion of 25% and severe diastolic dysfunction.\n\n【28】The patient continued to experience persistent tachycardia and shortness of breath in spite of treatment. He was main-tained on beta-blocker and diuretic therapy with cardiac mon-itoring as he was considered to be high risk for arrhythmia. On day 32 of admission， the patient developed cardiac arrestwith a rhythm of pulseless electrical activity. After 2 cycles of resuscitation the rhythm degraded to asystole. Unfortunately， despite 40 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation， the patient could not be revived. Given the worsening tachycardia and WPW pattern on ECGs， the patient's cause of death was as sumed to be arrhythmia secondary to conduction abnormali-ties as a result of infiltrative cardiac disease.\n\n【29】Discussion\n\n【30】Cardiac amyloidosis is a frequent feature of AL amyloidosis； it occurs due to the replacement of the normal myocardial con-tractile elements with interstitial deposits of amyloid，leading to alterations in cellular metabolism. Amyloid deposition with-in the myocardium affects the integrity of the tissue structure， causing it to become firm， rubbery， and noncompliant. Cardiac amyloidosis most commonly presents with restrictive cardio-myopathy and congestive heart failure .\n\n【31】In 2012 the incidence of cardiac amyloidosis was estimat-ed to be 17 per 100 000 person-years in the United States， with a prevalence rate of 55 per 100 000 person-years in the same year.\n\n【32】Patients with cardiac amyloidosis usually present with signs of heart failure， including exertional and positional dyspnea， lower-limb edema， ascites， and syncope. Increased jugular venous pressure can be detected on physical examination. Conduction abnormality can be also a result of amyloid pro-tein infiltration in the cardiac tissues， manifesting with nodal arrhythmia and heart block .\n\n【33】Cardiac involvement in amyloidosis is seen mainly in either AL amyloidosis or transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR). In fact， up to 50% of patients with AL amyloidosis have cardiac disease at diagnosis and it is the principal determinant of prognosis. The estimated survival rate in cardiac amyloidosis is around6 months in AL amyloidosis compared to a few years in trans-thyretin amyloidosis .\n\n【34】Transthyretin (TTR)-related amyloidosis is a result of accumula-tion of the protein transthyretin， a transport protein produced by the liver. The 2 subtypes of this condition are acquired TTR amyloidosis， also called senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA)， or hereditary transthyretin-related amyloidosis (ATTR). In ATTR， patients are born with an inherited genetic defect in the TTR protein that results in excessive breakdown of this protein. Interestingly， ATTR tends to present much later in life， with symptoms of amyloidosis typically manifesting between the ages of 30 to 60 years. It is a heritable disorder wherein the defective gene is passed down to about 50% of offspring. On the other hand， in senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA)， there isbreakdown of the normal TTR protein， for which the mecha-nism is not fully understood. Typically， it affects the heart， usu-ally presenting with congestive symptoms in elderly men .\n\n【35】In vitro studies have demonstrated the effect of light-chain proteins on cardiac tissues in mice， mainly causing diastol-ic dysfunction. There is also evidence to suggest that light-chain protein has a direct toxic effect on cardiac tissue inde-pendent of fibril formation， which may be responsible for the rapid progression to cardiomyopathy in patients with AL am-yloidosis .\n\n【36】Orthostatic hypotension has previously been reported， but un-like our patient， most of these reported cases were found to have heart block or sick sinus syndrome . The resolution of orthostatic hypotension with i.v. fluids in our case suggests the etiology of hypovolemia was severe vomiting and/or au-tonomic dysfunction门.\n\n【37】Amyloid fibril in the liver and the spleen can bind to factor X， causing deficiency evident primarily by abnormal coagulation profile (eg， PT， INR， and PTT) with correction after addition of normal plasma (mixing study)， as in our patient. A study found that 28% of patients with AL amyloidosis had abnormal bleed-ing tendency and almost half of them (51%) had abnormal co-agulation profile .\n\n【38】The diagnosis of systemic amyloidosis is confirmed by tissue biopsy from accessible sites like the abdominal fat pad， or from bone morrow biopsy， which are preferred to more invasive liv-er and cardiac biopsy despite lower diagnostic yield in prima-ry amyloidosis. Coagulopathy， especially severe factor X defi-ciency， is a serious challenge in obtaining tissue samples. Our patient required high doses of prothrombin complex in order to obtain safe biopsies. Involvement of the thyroid in primary amyloidosis was also reported. Most of the patients were eu-thyroid and， less commonly， presented with a toxic goiter . Our patient had signs of toxic thyroiditis， but we did not have the chance to obtain a thyroid biopsy to establish a diagnosis of AL amyloidosis-related thyroiditis.\n\n【39】In cardiac amyloidosis， echocardiography typically shows lon-gitudinal left ventricular dysfunction with a possible restric-tive pattern . Other investigations include cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) using gadolinium. The presence of subendocardial and then transmural late gadolinium enhance-ment is specific and can detect early disease before the devel-opment of left ventricular hypertrophy .\n\n【40】Nuclear scanning using Technetium-99 m pyrophosphate (Tc-99 m PYP)， an isotope with high affinity to amyloid proteins， has very high accuracy and positive predictive value in diag-nosing cardiac amyloidosis， especially ATTR . Cardiac tissuebiopsy remains the criterion standard of diagnosis； it is done by obtaining around 4 or 5 pinhead-sized pieces from the right ventricle. Cardiac amyloid tissue stains light pink in color， dis-turbing the normal layout of the cardiac myocytes.\n\n【41】The association between pre-excitation syndrome and AL am-yloidosis is unclear， but there is 1 case report of gastro-in-testinal amyloidosis leading to Gl bleeding in a patient with known WPW syndrome， but there were no signs of system-ic amyloidosis or cardiac infiltrative disease， so it might have been incidental \n\n【42】Management of cardiac amyloidosis is directed toward manage-ment and treatment of heart failure symptoms and treatment of the underlying disease. It should be noted， however， that the usual treatment for heart failure using beta blockers and angio-tensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is poorly tolerated， es-pecially in light-chain disease， and these medications do not ap-pearto add a prognostic benefit in such patients. Loop diuretics remain the mainstay of treatment to control heart failure symp-toms in patients with cardiac amyloidosis. Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers can improve diastolic function by re-laxation time prolongation . Advanced cardiac amyloidosis requires more specialized treatment including ventricular as-sistive devices and， less frequently， heart transplantation .\n\n【43】Delayed conduction due to infiltration of the conduction sys-tem by the amyloid protein may necessitate placement of a pacemaker， but the overall health status of the patient may limit or delay these interventions. Ventricular arrhythmia is typically managed conservatively through the use of beta blockers and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers， but this carries a risk of severe systemic hypotension so use of this approach is limited. Implantable defibrillators may be considered depending on the clinical status .\n\n【44】Initiating treatment early in AL amyloidosis can improve the survival rate in heart failure patients. Therapy consists mainly of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide or bortezomib. More recent trials with the CD 38 monoclonal antibody daratumum-ab have shown promising results and this has been used as an adjunct in treatment. For patients with plasma cell dyscra-sia， autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is considered. Our patient was started on chemotherapy and had a good ini-tial response， but then had rapid worsening of cardiac disease.\n\n【45】Conclusions\n\n【46】AL amyloidosis can present with various signs and symptoms as a result of diffuse involvement of multiple organ systems. This case report demonstrates the diagnostic challenge of a novel presentation of a well-known disease. Infiltrative disease is an important differential diagnosis that must be considered in cases of organ disease accompanied by unexplained coag-ulation abnormalities. Cardiac involvement in amyloidosis， in particular， is a predictor of poor prognosis and must be man-aged with specialized care due to the potentially fatal com-plications that can occur as a result of heart failure and con-duction abnormalities.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The patient recovered and was discharged after two weeks.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Gastric ulcer， posterior perforation， lesser sac， pneumoperitoneum\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Every year gastric ulcer affects about 4 million people worldwide. Around 10 to 20% of the patients suffer from complications in which 2 to 14% of the ulcers perforate . Anteriorly per-forated gastric ulcer present with severe abdominal pain with signs of peritonitis. It is more common in the pyloro-duodenal area of the stomach .\n\n【4】Posterior perforated gastric ulcer is a unique category of pep-tic ulcer perforation with distinct clinical presentation. It is associated with high mortality and morbidity if delayed diag-nosis . Patients' chances of survival are improved by early surgical intervention. Here we report a case of posterior antral perforation in an 80-year-old male patient.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】An 80-year-old male presented with a complaint of pain ab-domen in the emergency. The patient had generalised abdom-inal pain prior to the night， which gradually worsened. The patient was admitted to a local hospital where he was treatedsymptomatically and later referred to a higher centre. On exam-ination， the patient was dehydrated with low blood pressure. There was tenderness around the epigastric region. The patient had no history of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug abuse. The patient had a history of smoking for the past 20 years. The patient was resuscitated and started on IV antibiotics and anal-gesics. A nasogastric tube and urethral catheter were passed， and the patient was planned for surgery. Exploratory laparo-tomy was performed， and the abdominal cavity was opened. The anterior surface of the stomach， duodenum， and the rest of the GIT， were inspected， and no perforation was found. Gastric content and food particles were seen coming out from the lesser sac. On careful inspection， approximately 2x1x1 cm perfo-ration was found at the posterior gastric wall near the antrum. Biopsy was taken from the edge of the defect， and an omental patch repair was performed after a thorough peritoneal lavage. The patient recovered after two weeks， and the gastric biopsy was normal.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Fewer than 30 cases have been reported with posterior perfora-tion of gastric ulcers. In a series of 125 consecutive perforated peptic ulcer patients operated by Hamilton Bailey， there was only one case of perforation of the posterior surface of the stomach. Wong and colleagues reviewed nine patients with posterior perforation who were treated from January 1992 to June 2002. Their findings were sealed perforation，localised retroperitoneal abscess and generalised peritoneal contamination of the lessersac and peritoneal cavity . In most cases， benign gastric ulcers lie along the lesser curvature of the stomach. However， 5-8%of ulcers lie in the posterior wall of the body of the stomach. Posterior gastric ulcer penetrates into the lesser sac behind the stomach. The lesser sac is a potential space less effective in sealing off the perforation. Pus， along with the gastric content， accumulates in the lesser sac forming an abscess. Through the foramen of Winslow， the toxic fluid passes into the peritoneal cavity leading to generalised peritonitis . Abdominal x-ray findings suggest pneumoperitoneum is pathognomic of gastroin-testinal perforation in 67 to 80% of cases . Multidetector CT has an essential role in the diagnosis of perforated peptic ulcers and in the determination of the site of operation. Presence of retro gastric air and/ or fluid collection hints at posterior gas-tric perforation A chest x-ray did not show air under the diaphragm in our patient.\n\n【9】Outside CECT， Abdomen findings suggest pneumoperi-toneum along lesser sac with retro gastric air. Intraoperatively， posterior gastric perforation near the antrum was approximately2x1x1cm. The post-operative period was uneventful， and the patient was discharged after two weeks.\n\n【10】Conclusion\n\n【11】Posterior gastric perforation Is associated with a late presenta-tion and high mortality. CT Scan plays an important role in the diagnosis of the site of the perforation. Suppose there is a retroperitoneal abscess and gastric content in the lesser sac. In that case， the possibility of posterior gastric perforation should be kept in mind.\n\n【12】come of Surgical Treatment of Perforated Peptic Ulcers in\n\n【13】Northwestern Tanzania： A Tertiary Hospital Experience.\n\n【14】World Journal of Emergency Surgery， 6， 31", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Candida albicans is the most common pathogenic yeast to neonates but invasive fungal infections caused by uncommon fungi have emerged in recent years. Wickerhamomyces anomalus is a emerging fungal pathogen causing blood stream infection in neonates， which has reportedly caused only few cases in the literature. Here we present a case series of total twelve cases of Wickernamomyces anomalus isolated from blood of neonates. All 12 isolates were identified by Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization- time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and were susceptible to voriconazole， amphotericin-B， caspofungin and 3 isolates showed reduced susceptibility to fluconazole. Risk factor assessment was also performed which showed that preterm birth and antibiotic use were most common associated risk factors. Despite all available treatment measures four out of twelve neonates died during treatment. This case series highlights Wickerhamomyces anomalus as an emerging fungal pathogen and emphasize the importance of molecular methods in its accurate identification.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Neonates， Candida albicans， Wickerhamomuces anomalus，MALDI-TOF MS， Preterm birth\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Invasive fungal infections are an important cause of mortality and morbidity in the neonatal period， especially in preterm infants. Candida spp. are mainly responsible for most of the cases and generally colonises the skin， mucosal surfaces， and gastrointestinal tract and is also capable of forming biofilms. Neonate's immature immune system prevents the development of the defences of the skin and mucous membranes， whichhelps Candida spp. to invade the blood flow and spread， thus making it difficult to eradicate such infections . Invasive fungal in-fections caused by uncommon fungi have increased in recent vears. Factors of the human hosts that have contributed to this change include i.) Increase in patients with immunedeficiencies(including cancer survivors and HIV-infection) ii.) Increase in numbers of premature neonates iii.) Increased use of vascular catheters. As survival of high-risk individuals improves with advances in modern medicine， and with more procedures per-formed as outpatients， encounters with different environmental fungi will occur. Rapid， accurate identification presents a con-1WL stant challenge for clinical laboratory scientists and clinicians. As newer antifungals are introduced， the need for correct identi-fication becomes more important than in the past. Conventional methods are often limited in their ability to identify new yeast species， since the discriminatory power may be limited. Molec-ular assays offer a robust platform for accurate identification over conventional methods. Wickerhamomyces anomalus was pre-viously kept under genus Pichia. Pichia is an ascomycetous yeast genus； many Pichia species are the teleomorph stage of Candidaa. Gram stain image of Wickerhamomyces anomalusspecies . There are approximately 90 species in this genus， but only a few species have been documented as causing human infections. These species include P.angusta， P. anomala， P. farinose，P. (Candida) guilliermondii， P. (Candida lambica) fermentans， P. (Can-dida) norvegensis， and P. (Candida utilis) jadinii. Candida pelliculosa，also known as Hansenula anomala， a yeast mainly found in plants， fruits， and oil， was first described as causative in a NICU out-break of fungemia in 1986，  with sporadic events related to immunocompromised patients。 and outbreaks reported since J. The objectives of our study were：\n\n【4】1\\. To study the antifungal susceptibility pattern of this emerg-ing yeast in NICU patients\n\n【5】2\\. To assess the potential risk factors associated with Wicker-hamomyces anomalus infection.\n\n【6】Case series\n\n【7】This case series includes 12 neonates with clinical signs and symptoms of sepsis who were admitted to the Department of Pediatrics， S.S Hospital， Institute of Medical Sciences， Banaras Hindu University between July 2016 to June 2018. Blood samples were collected in biphasic media containing brain heart infusion agar and broth  by heel prick of right and left medial plantar surface from two different sites. They were sent for culture and sensitivity to the department of microbiology. During these two years total， 119 neonates had positive fungal blood culture. Out of the 119 yeast isolates 12 were unidentified by the conventional method of identification which includes Gram staining， colour production on HiCromeM， germ tube production， urease test， standard sugar assimilation and fermentation pattern. These unidentified yeast isolates were stocked in 10% glycerol in screw-capped microcentrifuge tubes. For confirmation of these isolates， the stocks were sent to the Department of Microbiology， Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research， Chandi-garh， India， for identification by MALDI-TOF-MS (BRUKER series).\n\n【8】Identification by MALDI TOF MS\n\n【9】For this， the on-plate formic acid extraction method was used. Briefly， a loop-full of fresh Candida colonies (2-3 colonies) were emulsified in 1-mL sterile double-distilled water in a micro-centrifuge tube and vortexed vigorously. The suspension was then centrifuged at 13，000 rpm for 2 min， and the pellet was collected. This step was repeated two times and the pellet was re-suspended in 50 uL sterile double distilled water. One mi-crolitre of this suspension was spotted on the MALDI targetb. Whitish pink colour colonies of Wickerhamomyces anomalus on HiCrome.\n\n【10】plate and air-dried. Subsequently， the spot was overlaid with0.5 uL formic acid (98%) and again left for air drying. Finally，0.8 uL of matrix solution (100 uL of matrix solution containing：50 uL acetonitrile， 2.5 uL trifluoroacetic acid， 1 mg a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid and 47.5 uL sterile double distilled water) was added on each spot and air dried.MALDI-TOF MS analy-sis was performed on MALDI Microflex LT mass spectrometer(Bruker Daltonik GmbH， Bremen， Germany). The results were analysed on the basis of score values recommended by the man-ufacturer that was as： ≥2 log score for species identification；1.7-1.99 for genus identification； and <1.7 as unreliable. All clinical and demographic data were reviewed from the medical records of neonatal intensive care section (Dept. of Pediatrics， S.S Hospital， BHU， Varanasi) for assessment of potential risk factors .\n\n【11】Susceptibility testing was performed for all the 12 isolates by microbroth dilution method using fluconazole (Himedia)， voriconazole (Sigma)， caspofungin (Sigma) and amphotericin-B(Himedia) as antifungal agents. CLSI interpretive criteria were employed for fluconazole (MIC 8ug/mL)， voriconazole (MIC 1ug/mL)， caspofungin (MIC 2 yg/mL) and amphotericin-B (MIC\n\n【12】1 vg/mL). Candida krusei ATCC 6258 and Candida parupsilosis\n\n【13】ATCC 22019 served as quality control strains. (National Com-mittee for Clinical Laboratory Standards). Out of 119 isolates12 were identified as Wickerhamomyces anomalus by MALDI-TOF-MS with BRUKER value >1.9  and were susceptible to caspofungin， amphotericin-B and voriconazole. Three iso-lates showed reduced susceptibility towards fluconazole with MIC value 8ug/ mL. The MIC of caspofungin， amphotericin B， voriconazole and fluconazole ranged as 0.005-0.125 ug/ml，0.01-0.5 ug/ ml， 0.06-0.5 ug/ ml and 2-8 ug/ ml respectively. Caspofungin had the lowest geometric mean mini-mum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 0.02 ug/ml followed by amphotericin B (0.2 yg/ ml)， voriconazole (0.30 pg/ml) and fluconazole (4.66 ug/ml).\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Candida albicans is the organism which is most often associated with serious fungal infections， but in the present era other Can-dida species have emerged as clinically important pathogens which can cause opportunistic infections . According to the various literatures it is seen that W.anomalus fungemia caused outbreaks in NICU and pediatric wards， while most of the adult cases were sporadic case reports . W.anomalus can be easily isolated from various fruits， tree exudates， soil， vegetables and other organic compounds . It has occasionally been reported as a causative agent of fungemia in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients， including HIV patients . It has also been reported that W.anomalus is a causative agent of nosocomial cerebral ventriculitis in low-birth-weight neonates， endocarditis in an intravenous drug abuser and urinary tract infection in a renal transplant recipient . In our study prematurity， prolong hospital stay and multiple antibiotic use were most common associated risk factors. These findings sup-port an earlier report of a P.anomala nosocomial outbreak in pediatric patients， in which Murphy et al. and Chakraborty et al. reported that all patients had multiple problems associated with very low birth weight and prematurity. Regarding anti-fungal susceptibility pattern， our study has shown that all the twelve isolates were susceptible to caspofungin， amphotericin-B and voriconazole and three isolates showed reduced suscepti-bility towards fluconazole. Fluconazole resistance shown by W.anomalus has also been reported earlier by Chakraborty et al. and Barchiesi et al.\n\n【16】Table 1 Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with W.anomalus fungemia\n\n| Patient no  | Gestation (in week)  | Age (indays)  | Sex  | Birth weight (in gram)  | Multiple antibiotic use  | Outcome  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | 32  | 8  | Male  | 1115  | Yes  | Died  |\n| 2  | 36  | 10  | Female  | 1825  | No  | Cured  |\n| 3  | 37  | 3  | Male  | 1350  | Yes  | Died  |\n| 4  | 32  | 7  | Male  | 1300  | Yes  | Cured  |\n| 5  | 33  | 5  | Female  | 1540  | Yes  | Cured  |\n| 6  | 32  | 14  | Male  | 1500  | Yes  | Cured  |\n| 7  | 28  | 2  | Male  | 900  | No  | Died  |\n| 8  | 30  | 8  | Male  | 1250  | No  | Cured  |\n| 9  | 28  | 7  | Male  | 1320  | Yes  | Cured  |\n| 10  | 26  | 5  | Female  | 530  | Yes  | Died  |\n| 11  | 34  | 11  | Male  | 1500  | No  | Cured  |\n| 12  | 32  | 14  | Female  | 1440  | Yes  | Cured  |\n\n【18】Table 2 BRUKER value of all the isolates\n\n| ISOLATE NO.  | BRUKER VALUE (MALDI score)  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1  | 2.030  |\n| 2  | 2.217  |\n| 3  | 2.084  |\n| 4  | 1.881  |\n| 5  | 2.131  |\n| 6  | 2.136  |\n| 7  | 2.120  |\n| 8  | 2.149  |\n| 9  | 1.974  |\n| 10  | 1.954  |\n| 11  | 2.047  |\n| 12  | 1.94  |\n| BRUKER VALUE (MALDI score) >1.9→ Reliable identification (upto species level)， 1.7-1.9→Identification upto genus level，<1.7→ Not reliable identification  |  |\n\n| ISOLATESNO.  | CAS  | AMP  | VOR  | FLU  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | 0.005  | 0.01  | 0.25  | 4  |\n| 2  | 0.005  | 0.25  | 0.25  | 4  |\n| 3  | 0.03  | 0.5  | 0.5  | 8  |\n| 4  | 0.005  | 0.5  | 0.25  | 2  |\n| 5  | 0.03  | 0.03  | 0.06  | 4  |\n| 6  | 0.03  | 0.06  | 0.25  | 4  |\n| 7  | 0.125  | 0.5  | 0.06  | 2  |\n| 8  | 0.03  | 0.03  | 0.25  | 4  |\n| 9  | 0.01  | 0.01  | 0.5  | 4  |\n| 10  | 0.03  | 0.25  | 0.5  | 8  |\n| 11  | 0.01  | 0.25  | 0.25  | 8  |\n| 12  | 0.01  | 0.01  | 0.5  | 4  |\n\n【21】Conclusion\n\n【22】Fungal infections are an important cause of mortality and mor-bidity in the neonatal period， especially in preterm infants.

{"seq_id": "63fd5724-e9e2-4adb-b3b2-01721bd27528", "title": null, "text": "【0】Background：\n\n【1】Ectopic liver (EL) is liver tissue that is not attached to the mother liver， and is also known as choristoma and hepar succenturiatum. According to Watanabe’s 1060-patient series， it has an incidence rate of less than 1%(0.47%). The absence of an anatomical attachment to the hepatic proper is a rare congenital departure from the norm， known as EL. EL is thought to be caused by abnormal hepatic tissue growth from the foregut diver-ticulum， particularly at cystic structures.\n\n【2】Case Report： We report the successful management of a 47-year-old male patient， not known to have any medical illness， who was referred to the surgical team with a clinical picture of biliary colic. An ultrasound (US) abdomen was performed， and cholecystitis was confirmed. During a laparoscopic cholecystectomy ET was identified by chance. He tolerated the operation well. Gallbladder histological examination revealed significant mucosal and wall ul-cers， chronic inflammation， many black stones， no dysplasia or malignancy and connected liver tissue measur-ing 12x5 mm. As a result， chronic calcular cholecystitis was confirmed， as was normal EL architecture and no evidence of malignancy.\n\n【3】Conclusions： We conclude that EL is a rare condition， but there have been cases reported in the literature. Imaging modal-ities such as US and computed tomography scans are recommended to rule out other underlying diagnoses and should be tailored to each individual when necessary. Because the presence of EL attached to the vesi-cle is a rare occurrence in the literature， a histological examination is required due to the elevated risk of he-patocellular carcinoma. Keeping such an abnormality in mind can help surgeons demarcate the embryological plane of dissection during cholecystitis to avoid tumor cell spillages if present.\n\n【4】Keywords： Cholecystectomy， Laparoscopic· Cholecystitis · Choristoma\n\n【5】EL is a rare congenital anomaly lacking an anatomical connec-tion to the liver proper . EL is thought to be caused by an abnormal migration of hepatic tissue from the foregut diver-ticulum at cystic formations. The attachment to the gallblad-der surface is the most common location of EL but it can occur elsewhere， including the heart， lungs， chest wall， diaphragm， umbilicus， spleen， pancreas， esophagus， stomach， jejunum， adrenals， kidneys， testes， retroperitoneum， hepatic ligament， and inferior vena cava .\n\n【6】Preoperative EL diagnosis was reported in only a few papers. EL does not usually cause symptoms and， due to its small size， can be overlooked on imaging . The gallbladder must be removed， preferably with the assistance of an“endobag.\"Because malignant transformation to hepatocellular carcino-ma of the choristoma has been observed in less than 5% of gallbladders associated with EL ， there is a greater risk of neoplastic cell implantation in the portals of access to the ab-dominal cavity. We report our successful management of a case of completely excised EL on the gallbladder.\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】Our patient was a 47-year-old Saudi man with no history of medical illness or surgery. He presented to the gastroenterolo-gy clinic in December 2020 with right upper-quadrant pain that had been present for 2 months， no nausea or vomiting， and no changes in urine or stool color. He had a history of Helicobacter pylori infection， was on Helicobacter pylori treatment， and re-ported no improvement. Examination was unremarkable，oth-er than tenderness in the right upper quadrant. Laboratory workup revealed C-reactive protein (CRP) of 1.03 mg/L (normal range 0-3.0 mg/l)， alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 79 U/L (nor-mal range 40-129 U/L)， direct bilirubin of 0.231 mg/dL (nor-mal range 0-0.2 mg/dL)， total bilirubin of 0.729 mg/dL (normal range 0.146-1.4 mg/dL)， aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of64.8 U/L (normal range 0-40 U/L)， and alanine aminotransfer-ase (ALT) of 45 U/L (normal range 0-40 U/L). Complete blood count， creatinine， and serum electrolytes were all within normal limits. Serology results of hepatitis B， C， and Hl were negative.\n\n【9】The US abdomen  revealed a calcular gallbladder with a slightly thickened wall (5 mm)， no evidence of focal lesion or intrahepatic biliary dilatation， and CBD， and the portal vein was within normal range. After completing Helicobacter pylori treatment， the patient was seen again in the gastroenterology clinic 1 week later. He still had pain， bloating， and decreased appetite. The examination was unremarkable. The results of the tests revealed that there was no Helicobacter antigen in the stool and no occult blood. The patient was referred to a surgery clinic for surgical management after being diagnosed with acute cholecystitis on top of chronic cholecystitis.\n\n【10】In March 2021， the patient was admitted voluntarily for lap-aroscopic cholecystectomy. Prophylactic antibiotics were giv-en in the form of cefoxitin sodium 1000 mg. The patient was intubated and ventilated mechanically. He was placed in su-pine position. The abdomen was prepared and draped before4 ports were inserted in a similar manner. The gallbladder was mildly inflamed， with attachment to the duodenum and EL on the gallbladder . Adhesolysis was performed first by exposing the Calot’s triangle. A critical view of safety was maintained. The cystic artery and duct were clipped us-ing a hemoclip. The gallbladder was removed using an endo-bag， and hemostasis was ensured . Fascia and skin were closed. The patient was extubated without complications and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.\n\n【11】Postoperatively， the patient was given omeprazole 40 mg i.v. once daily， as well as analgesia (ibuprofen 400 mg i.v. every6 h) and cefoxitin sodium 1000 mg i.v. every 8 h. Six hours af-ter surgery， he began a low-fat diet. He was hospitalized for1 day. He had no postoperative symptoms， was able to eat， and had no nausea or vomiting. He was released from the hos-pital in good condition.\n\n【12】The patient was seen and evaluated in the surgery clinic 2weeks after the procedure as part of a routine follow-up. He had no symptoms. The examination was uneventful， and the surgical wounds were clean and dry.\n\n【13】Gall bladder histological examination revealed that the gall-bladder measured 8.6×3×1.3 cm， the serosa was greenish brown， the mucosa was dark green and rough， the wall thick-ness ranged from 0.2 cm to 0.4 cm， and there were several black stones. The gallbladder was described microscopically as having extensive ulceration of the mucosa and wall， as well as chronic inflammation， with no evidence of malignancy， and liver tissue measuring 12x5 mm attached. As a result， the di-agnosis of chronic calcular cholecystitis with normal EL archi-tecture and no dysplasia or malignancy was reached.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Ectopia is defined as the relocation or misalignment of an or-gan or a body part. Ectopic liver was discovered for the first time in 1922 . EL can be found anywhere other than the mother liver， such as the thorax， umbilical cord， intra- or ex-tra-pleural， retroperitoneal， jejunal， pancreas gland， adrenal glands， spleen， falciform ligament， pylorus， esophagus， or peri-cardiac cavity . EL is most often noted on the gallbladder . Similarly， in our case， an EL was discovered on the gallbladder.\n\n【16】Several mechanisms could explain the presence of EL in vari-ous locations . Most researchers agree on 2 possible expla-nations： the first is the development of an EL in addition to decay or reduction of the original attachment to the main liver， and the second is the displacement or migration of a portion of the pars hepatica to the rudiments of various organs .\n\n【17】Most cases of EL are asymptomatic， and imaging studies are rarely used to diagnose it before a surgical procedure . Diagnosis may be missed due to its small size  and be-cause radiologists may be unaware of it. There is an established correlation between EL and gallbladder diseases such as chole-lithiasis and cholecystitis . Nonetheless， it can present with recurrent abdominal pain due to hemorrhagic necrosis， tor-sion， or rupture， or with pressure symptoms due to mass for-mation due to malignant alteration ， including esophageal obstruction and portal vein obstruction. Our patient presented with symptoms of cholecystitis， and ectopic liver tissue was discovered by chance during laparoscopic cholecystitis surgery.\n\n【18】EL has the same histopathology as the mother liver， including cirrhosis， hemosiderosis， hepatitis， and hepatocellular carcino-ma (HCC) . HCC was found in less than 5% of gallbladder cases associated with EL， and several cases had normal native liver tissue . Although HCC is uncommon， it requires the same approach as carcinoma in the mother liver， according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines . Our histological examination of the gallbladder revealed no evi-dence of malignancy.\n\n【19】Ultrasound-guided (USG) percutaneous biopsies have been shown to be useful for preoperative diagnosis by revealing normal liver parenchyma . In addition， computed tomog-raphy (CT) and hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scans can help with diagnosis. Furthermore， color Doppler USG or angiography could show a nourishing vessel . However， our patient presented with cholecystitis symptoms and thus underwent abdominal ultrasound (US). Because the US abdo-men revealed no ectopic tissue， it was not possible to order additional investigations， such as a CT， MRl， or HIDA scan in a case of cholecystitis. As a result，imaging modalities should be tailored to each patient.\n\n【20】We conclude that EL is a rare entity， but there have been re-ports of cases in the literature. Imaging modalities， such as US and CT scans， are suggested to eliminate other deferen tial diagnoses and should be tailored to each individual when necessary. Due to the increased risk of hepatocellular carci-noma， the presence of EL adhered to the vesicle is a possibil-ity that is not commonly reported in the literature， so a histo-pathological study is mandatory. In addition， the EL must be removed in an endobag to avoid any possibility of port seal-ing of cancer cells when present. Being aware of this anomaly can help surgeons delineate the embryological plane of dissec-tion during cholecystectomy and eliminate the risk of malig-nant transformation of EL", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Several types of crystalline structures such as amylase， tyrosine， collagenous， oxalate， and intraluminal crystals have been described in neoplastic and non-neoplastic salivary gland lesions. Although very rare， crystal-loids have been reported in both benign and malignant lesions. Microscopic identification of the crystalloids is made accord-ing to differences in structural appearance . Thus， since it can guide in differentiating benign and malignant lesions， it is essential to identify the type of crystalloid.\n\n【4】A 73-year-old man was admitted to the department of radi-ology with a complaint of a painless mass in the left parotid gland. The history of the patient was unremarkable， and the physical examination was normal. Ultrasonographic exami-nation demonstrated a well-defined， hypoechoic lesion in the tail portion of the left parotid， measuring 15×10 mm. Given the clinical and radiological features， prediagnosis of the pa-tient was considered as a lymphoepithelial cyst in the parotid gland. Ultrasound-guided FNAB was performed according to standard procedure using a 22-gauge needle. About 1.0 cc of a mucoid， cream-coloured fluid was aspirated. The aspirated fluid was smeared using a liquid-based monolayer cytology method (Becton Dickinson SurePath PrepStain Slide Processor， Becton Dickinson Diagnostics， Burlington， USA). Smears were stained with routine Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E)，Papanicolaou(PAP)， and May Grunwald Giemsa (MGG) stains. Microscopic examination of smears revealed many geometric， multifaceted non-birefringent crystalloids varying in size. The crystalloids were rectangular， rhomboid and rod-shaped with parallel sides. They stained pink， eosinophilic with H&E ， bright orange with PAP  and deep blue with MGG . Inflammatory cells and rare benign ductal epithelial cells were observed in a mucoid background. The cytopathological diagnosis was reported as a benign non-specific cystic lesion with amylase crystalloids. The patient did not undergo any sur-gical procedure. There was no growth of the mass in the one year's follow-up after the diagnosis.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Takeda and Ishikawa first demonstrated amylase crystalloids in a salivary duct cyst， and they suggested that crystalloids may re-sult from the amylase of saturated saliva . Jayaram et al. first described amylase crystalloids in FNAB smear from a parotid cyst . Yada et al. suggested that the presence of a cystic space， reflecting salivary stasis， seems to be essential for the forma-tion of the crystalloids . It is essential to differentiate other types of crystalloids from amylase crystalloids because different types of crystalloids can be seen in malignant salivary gland tumours . Whereas amylase crystalloids can be associated with nonneoplastic and neoplastic salivary gland diseases such as sialolithiasis， benign salivary gland tumours ， sialadenitis， lymphoepithelial cyst， and . Until now， amylase crys-talloids have not been presented in any malignant tumour of the salivary gland in the literature. Therefore， the occurrence of amylase crystalloids in FNAB smears of the salivary gland favours a benign lesion .\n\n【7】Amylase crystalloids in salivary glands can be recognized by routine staining methods such as PAP， H&E， and MGG stains. High amylase activity in cystic fluids can be assessed using bio-chemical methods . In light microscopic examination， amy-lase crystalloids appear as non-birefringent， geometric， polygo-nal， rhomboid-shaped structures ranging between 5 u and 500 u in size. They are stained orange with PAP， dark blue with MGG， and pink with H&E stain . Whereas， collagenous crystal-loids appear as radial and fusiform， birefringent， eosinophilic needle-shaped fibres of collagen on H&E stain. They are re-ported to be seen in pleomorphic adenomas， myoepitheliomas， and myoepithelial carcinomas . Tyrosine crystals ap-pear as a non-birefringent， eosinophilic， refractile， sunburst or petal shaped structure with blunt ends on H&E stain. They are mainly encountered in pleomorphic adenomas and malignant salivary gland neoplasms . Intraluminal crystalloidsappear as dense amorphous eosinophilic material， and they are described in malignant salivary gland tumours .\n\n【8】Consequently， the presence of crystalloids in FNAB of sali-vary glands should be examined carefully， because it is crucial to identify types of crystalloid as it can help in the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant salivary gland lesions. Also， an accurate diagnosis of these lesions from FNAB samples of salivary gland would be guided to clinicians in avoiding from unnecessary surgical intervention.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Gestational age is directly proportional to newborn survival. We report a case of a brain-dead pregnant wom-an at the 16th week of gestation and the successful delivery of a healthy child after 117 days of maternal so-matic support.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 27-year-old pregnant woman at 16 weeks’ gestation with large intracerebral hematoma after rupture of an arteriovenous malformation was admitted to our intensive care unit. Signs of brain death developed early and the woman was confirmed to be brain dead after day 6 of hospitalization. The decision-making process regard-ing course of medical treatment was complex and accompanied by uncertainties arising from the absence of a legal， ethical， and professional framework. A complex multidisciplinary approach was followed. The main aim was to maintain the brain-dead woman’s homeostasis to allow for proper development of the fetus. Monitoring of fetal growth was considered the best endpoint， and satisfactory fetus development was achieved. A healthy child was delivered with a birth weight of 2140 g. Her Apgar score was 10/10/10 at 1， 5， and 10 minutes， re-spectively， and favorable outcomes were observed at a 1-year follow-up.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】Brain death during pregnancy is an extremely rare but increasingly common condition. Guidelines for care man-agement are lacking， and reporting these cases may help establish medical treatment in future cases. We show that somatic support of the body of a brain-dead pregnant woman for an extended period of time can lead to successful delivery of a healthy child.\n\n【6】Keywords： Brain Death · Case Reports · Critical Care·Delivery， Obstetric · Life Support Care· PregnancySeveral medical emergencies directly or indirectly affecting the brain may lead to the development of brain death (BD). Continuation of somatic support after BD is diagnosed is cor-nerstone and common praxis in organ-donation programs. Development of BD during pregnancy is rare， and only 30 cas es have been described in the medical literature since 1982. involving 19 infants who were born and survived the neonatal period . Homeostasis and overall organ function must be maintained in brain-dead pregnant women to ensure proper development of the fetus. The gestational age is directly pro-portional to the survival of the baby， and thus attempts to pro-long the somatic support of brain-dead pregnant women should be made even in early phases of pregnancy， because doing so can lead to the successful delivery of a healthy child .\n\n【7】We report a case of a brain-dead pregnant woman at the 16th week of gestation and the successful delivery of a healthy child after 117 days of maternal somatic support， with overall good1-year outcomes for the child. This case report was prepared according to CARE guidelines . The patient's family provid-ed written informed consent for the publication of this report.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 27-year-old woman， secundigravida， in the 16h week of pregnancy， with a prior uncomplicated course of pregnancy in regular obstetric care， was found unconscious for an un-known period of time at home. She was referred to the emer-gency department.\n\n【10】She was a nonsmoker in good physical condition. She was not taking any medicines that increased the risk of bleeding. Her first pregnancy in 2016 was complicated during deliv-ery by paroxysms and generalized seizures， and an arteriove-nous malformation (AVM) of the left frontal-parietal brain lobe was diagnosed. She was administered levetiracetam and un-derwent gamma knife surgery during the same year. In 2018， she experienced another episode of seizures， and persistent AVM was diagnosed through magnetic resonance imaging Regarding the localization and anatomy of the AVM， no ther-apeutic option was offered to the patient. Although she knew of the high risk of AVM rupture， she became pregnant in 2019and she did not provide an advance life directive in the event that she would not be able to speak for herself. The pregnan-cy was complicated in early stages by AVM rupture， as de-scribed above. In the initial physical examination， she was in coma with Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3 points， her pupils were fixed and dilated at 5 mm， photoreaction was absent bi-laterally， her blood pressure was 110/75 mmHg， and her heart rate was 70 beats/min.\n\n【11】A computed tomography (CT) scan showed a large intracere-bral hematoma and ischemia of the left cerebral hemisphere， part of the right frontal lobe and the brainstem， with signs of expansion and cerebral edema . CT angiography was performed to identify the source of bleeding. The source could not be identified， owing to extensive edema and the hemorrhage itself.\n\n【12】Regarding the patient's history and results of CT showing a large hematoma localized to the region of the AVM， a diagno-sis of AVM rupture was determined with a high level of cer-tainty. Other causes of sudden unconsciousness， such as cere-bral venous sinus thrombosis， were also considered but were deemed unlikely. According to the clinical status of the patient and the CT findings， the prognosis of the patient was assessed as poor. However， the obstetric ultrasound examination showed a viable fetus. Because of the medical， legal， and ethical un-certainty associated with whether somatic support should be continued or stopped， the patient was admitted to the inten-sive care unit (ICU). A discussion with family members began after admission to the ICU. The agency in the decision-making process was given to the father of the child， but other fami-ly members'opinions were also considered. With respect for the family members’ wishes， a decision to proceed with the somatic support was made by the ICU team leader， in consen-sus with all ICU team members. A multidisciplinary approach was used to determine the best management of care in this case. With respect for the wishes of the family members， themultidisciplinary team developed a special medical manage-ment plan in an attempt to save the child. Clinical signs of BD were diagnosed on hospitalization day (HD) 1 and， according to the laws of the Czech Republic， the BD was assessed on the basis of an absence of defined brainstem reflexes on clinical examination (an apnea test is not mandatory and was not per-formed because of the possible negative effects of maternal hypoxia on the fetus). This clinical estimation was confirmed on HD 6， on the basis of brainstem auditory evoked poten-tials. The confirmation was mandatory for diagnosis of BD， and one of the instrumental methods that must be used by law.\n\n【13】Standard monitoring of vital signs and laboratory testing was performed during the entire ICU stay. Endocrinology labora-tory tests were performed regularly once per week (TSH， fT4， and serum cortisol)， and vitamin D levels were verified once per week. Fetal monitoring was performed daily for a period of 15 minutes with cardiotocography and ultrasound exami-nation of the fetal heart rate.\n\n【14】Somatic support of the brain-dead woman was continued with the aim of reaching at least 32 weeks of pregnancy and de-livering a viable fetus. The main goal of the somatic support was to provide a sufficient oxygen supply to all maternal or-gans， including the placenta. During the entire course of hos-pitalization， the lung protective strategy of artificial ventilation was applied with peak inspiratory pressures below 20 cmH，O. Vasopressors were administered to maintain the mean arterial pressure. Intravenous norepinephrine was replaced with dopa-mine on HD 53. Circulatory support was not needed after HD 99.\n\n【15】Hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction was managed with hor-mone supplemental therapy driven by plasma serum concen-trations of hormones， as discussed with an endocrinologist. The serum levels of cortisol and thyroxine were examined once per week， and substitutional therapy was used to maintain se-rum levels in normal ranges.\n\n【16】Levothyroxine was administered via a nasogastric tube， and the dose was increased throughout the ICU stay from 75 mcg on HD 17-24 to 100 mcg on HD 25-29， 125 mcg on HD 30-78， and125 mcg 5 days per week +137 mcg 2 days per week on HD79-117. A dose of 100 mg of hydrocortisone was given intrave-nously twice per day and was decreased gradually to 50 mg dai-ly on HD 30-50. Subsequently， the dose was switched to 30 mg daily， divided into 2 doses (20 mg in the morning and 10 mg in the evening). In the case of infection， the dose was increased to200 mg daily and was administered intravenously. Diabetes insip-idus developed on HD 1， and thus daily administration of desmo-pressin was necessary. We started with 60 mcg of desmopressin per day， and the dose was then titrated according to its effects. From HD 67， the dose was stabilized at 90 mcg of desmopres-sin per day and administered for the remainder of the ICU stay.\n\n【17】Infections were treated with antibiotics. Pneumonia developed twice. The first episode was caused by Staphylococcus aureus plus Streptococcus pneumoniae and was treated with intrave-nous administration of ampicillin/sulbactam. The second ep-isode was caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae and was treated with intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam. Urinary tract in-fections developed 3 times. The first episode was caused byKlebsiella oxytoca and Escherichia coli with extended-spectrumbeta lactamase (ESBL)， and was treated with meropenem. The second episode was caused by E. coli ESBL and was treated with meropenem. The etiology of the third urinary tract infection was mixed and was caused by E. coli ESBL and Enterococcus sp. This infection was treated with meropenem and ampicil-lin. Vaginal infection was treated once and was caused by E. coli ESBL. Local application of nifuratel was used for the treat-ment. The choice of antibiotics was made after considering culture results， local antibiotic policy， and the safety of each antibiotic during pregnancy. All infections were treated suc-cessfully， and amniotic fluid bacteriological cultures after de-livery were negative.\n\n【18】Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was administered sub-cutaneously for deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embo-lism prevention. The dose of LMWH was set according to the manufacturer's recommendation and based on body weight. LMWH was applied subcutaneously once daily after HD 14. Neither hemorrhagic nor thrombotic complications were di-agnosed during hospitalization.\n\n【19】To estimate the daily dose of calories and proteins to meet the nutritional demands of both the brain-dead mother and the developing fetus， the standard formula for critically ill patients was used. The actual body weight (ABW) in kilograms was mul-tiplied by 25 calories and by 1.5 g to determine the daily calor-ic and protein demand， respectively. From HD 24， the targets increased to 30 calories per kilogram ABW and 1.6 g protein， respectively. These amounts were further increased to 35 cal-ories per kg ABW and 1.8 g protein from HD 40. Finally， the targets were set at 45 calories and 2 g protein per kilogram ABW from HD 51. To meet these nutritional targets， a high-protein high-energy formula for enteral nutrition was continu-ously administered from HD 3， and from HD 42， the adminis-tration of nutrition switched to boluses. Special attention was paid to vitamin D replacement. The dose of oral preparation of cholecalciferol was set according to serum levels， and daily administration of 1500 IU was necessary to maintain the se-rum levels in normal ranges.\n\n【20】The body of the brain-dead woman was positioned in a semi-recumbent position to prevent the possible negative hemody-namic effects of an enlarged uterus compressing the inferior vena cava. From gestation week 27， she was positioned only laterally. Physiotherapy was performed by a physiotherapist 2times per day for 60 minutes. To simulate the mother's walk-ing， we used a MOTOmed letto2 leg/arm device (MOTOmed， RECK-Technik GmbH & Co. KG Medizintechnik， ReckstraBe 1-5，88422 Betzenweiler， Germany).\n\n| The woman  | Organ system  | Parameter  | Assessment  | Intervention  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| The woman  | Cardiovascular  | Blood pressure， heart  | Continuous  | Fluids if considered  |\n| The woman  |  | rate  |  | hypovolemic，inotropes  |\n| The woman  | Respiratory  | Blood gas analysis  | 3 times a day  | otherwise， preferentially  |\n| The woman  | Respiratory  | Blood gas analysis  | 3 times a day  | dopamine  |\n|  | Respiratory  | Blood gas analysis  | 3 times a day  | Lung protective mechanical  |\n|  | Respiratory  | Blood gas analysis  | 3 times a day  | ventilation， set to keep blood  |\n|  | Respiratory  | Blood gas analysis  | 3 times a day  | gases in normal range  |\n|  | Gastrointestinal/nutrition  | Growth of the fetus  | Once a week  | Gradual increase of the dose  |\n|  |  |  |  | of nutrition  |\n|  |  | Total serum protein，  | Once a week  | Gradual increase of the dose  |\n|  |  | albumin and prealbumin  |  | of nutrition  |\n|  |  | Serum vitamin D levels  | Once a week  | Substitution to keep serum  |\n|  |  |  |  | level in normal range  |\n|  | Renal  | Serum ions/urine specific  | 3 times a day/in  | Substitution，desmopressin in  |\n|  |  | gravity  | case of polyuria  | case of polyuria  |\n| The fetus  | Endocrine  | Serum hormone levels  | Once a week  | Substitution to keep serum  |\n| The fetus  |  | (thyroxine， cortisol)  |  | levels in normal range  |\n| The fetus  | Cardiovascular  | Cardiotocography  | Twice a day  |  |\n| The fetus  | Fetal growth  | Ultrasound biometry  | Once a week  |  |\n| The fetus  | Organ developmentmalformation  | Ultrasound  | Once a week  | 一  |\n\n【22】The organ system monitoring and support that was given is summarized in Table 1. To accelerate fetal lung maturity， we administered betamethasone on HD 53 (gestation week 25) and on HD 86 (gestation week 30). The development of the fetus was monitored regularly by an obstetrician. Ultrasound examination with biometry of the fetus was performed weekly to assess the growth of the fetus and rule out any organ de-velopment malformation. The progress of fetal growth is out-lined in Table 2. A clinical geneticist was consulted to assess the risk of a genetic disorder and chromosomal aberration on HD 11， and the results were negative.\n\n【23】Basal stimulation of the fetus was also performed. Each ma-nipulation of the brain-dead woman’s body was preceded by caressing of her abdomen and calling the fetus by name. The end of the manipulation was marked by a sound made by a toy. The family members were involved in basal stimulation， part of which involved gentle tactile stimulation of the brain-dead woman's abdomen， playing music， and reading fairy tales. The family members were supported by psychologists through-out the hospitalization.\n\n【24】Table 2.

After the delivery， the somatic support of the moth-er's body was terminated.\n\n【27】The newborn was admitted to the neonatal department and discharged after 11 days of uncomplicated hospitalization. Her weight at discharge was 2220 g. The baby was examined by a neurologist at 4 weeks， and 4， 9， and 12 months. Her neu-rologic status and psychomotor development were found to be in normal ranges. Key points of the case are summarized in the timeline and are shown in Figure 2.\n\n【28】Discussion\n\n【29】Progress in intensive care，technology and patient care in re-cent decades has brought about a unique situation in which somatic support of brain-dead pregnant women is possible to prolong the pregnancy until a viable fetus can be delivered. This situation is quite uncommon， and to date， only 25 cases have been described in the medical literature . To our knowl-edge， descriptions of only 3 cases in which the somatic sup port exceeded 100 days have been published .\n\n【30】The decision to continue somatic support of the body of a preg-nant woman after a diagnosis of BD is a controversial ethical and legal issue. There are no specific legal regulations associ-ated with somatic support after BD is diagnosed during preg nancy in the Czech Republic， and a wide range of options are present in different countries. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics has published guidelines for the management of the social and ethical challenges presented by BD during pregnancy . The guidelines outline 6 key rec-ommendations for the management of brain-dead pregnant women. Each recommendation was discussed， and attempts to follow the guidelines were made. The recommendations， and how they were addressed by the medical team， are sum-marized as follows： 1. Women have the right to die in digni-ty. This right should be respected in the treatment of everysingle patient. 2. Questions regarding maintaining pregnancy must be answered in consultation with the remaining family members. In the present case， the family members were in-volved in the decision-making process form the very begin-ning. The mother did not provide an advance life directive before BD occurred， and her wishes about whether to contin-ue life-sustaining therapy in the event of BD were unknown. However， the father of the child acted as the woman's agent and declared that in his and her family members'opinion， the woman would have wished that every effort be made to save her child. 3. Decisions on delivery in the event of BD should be made according to fetal viability. Surveillance of fetal well-being should be implemented. The fetus was not viable when BD was diagnosed. The woman was in stable condition， and no organ dysfunction was apparent at that time. Fetal well-being was assessed by an obstetrician， and no signs of fetal damage were found. 4. There is no low gestational age limit for the onset of fetal rescue after maternal BD. The gestational age of the fetus， and therefore the viability， was low， but this aspect was not considered. 5. The interest of the fetus must be considered. Efforts should be made to promote the birth of a mature， brain-intact infant. In our opinion， the best way to ensure this was to maximize efforts to secure the stabili-ty of the brain-dead pregnant mother of the fetus. All organ systems were carefully monitored and supported adequately as necessary. 6. The fetus should be allowed to die in utero if maternal or fetus distress calls for immediate delivery with a high probability of an unfavorable outcome. To address this issue， the medical team assessed the level of organ support of the brain-dead mother on a daily basis， taking precautions not to provide organ support beyond the level usually provid-ed for brain-dead organ donors； eg，the use of excessive vaso-pressor dosing to maintain adequate blood pressure or renal replacement therapy if acute renal failure develops. According to these guidelines， we focused primarily on the interest of the fetus， and the agency in the decision-making process was given to the father of the child.\n\n【31】Independent legal and professional advice was sought， but be-cause of the lack of legal regulations regarding this specific situation， opinions varied substantially， ranging from immedi-ately stopping supportive care to full support as long as pos-sible. After discussions with all members of the medica. team and the family members， a decision to continue with somatic support was made， and the support was sustained until the fetus reached maturity. The decision-making process was in-fluenced by the information that the woman and the father had known about the risks of a pregnancy associated with the woman's AVM and the potentially fatal complications for both the woman and the child in the event of AVM rupture.\n\n【32】If somatic support of a brain-dead mother is initiated in an early stage of pregnancy， when the fetus is not yet viable， arational effort should be made to maintain the pregnancy as long as possible and thus to allow for fetal development until viability is achieved. Neonatal disability is proportional to ges-tational age. The chance of survival of a baby born in gesta-tional week 22 is 1% and rises to 44% in gestational week 25. The probability of survival without a disability at 30 months shows a similar course and is approximately 0.7% in gestation-al week 22 and 23% in gestational week 25. From gestational week 32， the survival rate rises to 98%， with a risk of neuro-logical complications lower than 2%； therefore， making efforts to maintain the pregnancy until that time seems rational 9.\n\n【33】Because only individual cases of prolonged somatic support of the bodies of brain-dead pregnant women have been re-ported， there are no guidelines for the medical management of these women. Our management was based on our experi-ence with non-pregnant brain-dead patients， and we consid-ered the review by Mallampalli et al， who have discussed the physiologic changes and provided recommendations regarding organ support for brain-dead pregnant women .\n\n【34】Long-term management of a brain-dead patient may be asso-ciated with several complications.\n\n【35】The most severe complications are those leading to hemody-namic instability of the brain-dead pregnant woman， because this threatens the oxygen supply to the fetus. The pathophys-iological changes associated with BD lead to vasoplegia and hypotension.The usual management consists of the adminis-tration of intravenous fluids and vasoactive agents.\n\n【36】In our case， to maintain a mean arterial pressure above 65mmHg， we administered vasoactive agents. Norepinephrine was used for the first 53 HDs. Because of the detection of placental infarctions in an ultrasound examination， norepi-nephrine was replaced with dopamine on HD 53， because of the potentially negative effects of norepinephrine on placen-tal perfusion .\n\n【37】After the onset of BD， the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is dis rupted，thus leading to various clinical manifestations of pan-hypopituitarism. Steroids， vasopressors， levothyroxine， and des-mopressin were administered to maintain maternal endocrine homeostasis. However， data supporting a choice of hormon-al therapy， dosing， and effect on neonatal outcomes in brain-dead pregnant women are lacking. In our case， we adjusted the dosage of hormone replacement therapy in cooperation with an endocrinologist， according to the measured serum levels.\n\n【38】Infections are frequent and serious complications of prolonged intensive care . Hemodynamic instability associated with sepsis may negatively affect the deve lopment of the fetus and， if not successfully treated， can lead to fetal death. In our case， infections were successfully treated with antibiotics 6 times. The duration of antibiotic treatment was 56 out of 117 HDs in total. The choice of antimicrobial agents was made after dis cussion with a microbiologist， considering the safety of the individual antibiotics during pregnancy. Intravenous ampicil-lin/sulbactam， meropenem， and piperacillin/tazobactam were used to treat respiratory and urinary tract infections.\n\n【39】Special attention was paid to ensure adequate nutrition， be-cause fetal weight is a crucial factor for adequate fetal physi-ological development and a successful outcome of pregnancy. The increase in fetal weight throughout the pregnancy corre-sponded to the normal growth curve， and the birth weight was in the 75th percentile.\n\n【40】Efforts were made to positively support the neurobehavioral development of the fetus. Music， gentle tactile stimulation， and talking have been shown to have positive effects on the fetus. Prenatal music activities positively affect early brain matura-tion and neurodevelopment， and may also promote good in-tant temperament .\n\n【41】Conclusions\n\n【42】BD during pregnancy is an extremely rare but increasingly common condition， and its management is associated with medical， ethical， and legal uncertainties and controversies. Guidelines for care management are lacking， and reporting these cases may help establish medical treatment in future cases. We showed that somatic support of the body of a brain-dead pregnant woman for an extended period of time can lead to the successful delivery of a healthy child. This possi-bility should be considered during decision-making processes regarding whether to commence somatic support after BD is diagnosed in pregnant women.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

We report a case of a painful right superficial peroneal nerve schwannoma that was excised via the intracapsular micro-enucleation technique.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 60-year-old South Asian man presented with a 2-year history of a painful lump on the lateral aspect of the right upper leg. Clinical examination revealed a firm mass located at the proximal lateral aspect of the right leg， measuring approximately 3x2.5 cm. Severe tenderness over the mass was present. The Tinel test was positive. There were no sensory or motor deficits or history of neurofibromatosis. Imaging showed features suggestive of a schwannoma. Surgery was indicated； intracapsular micro-enucleation was performed. Histopathological assessment of the tumor demonstrated Antoni A and B patterns with nuclear palisading and Verocay bodies，hallmarks of a schwannoma. The postoperative period was uneventful； no neurological deficits were noted.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】The case described is considered rare， with no data on disease epidemiology in the literature. We provide a brief review and add pivotal data to the literature. Despite its rarity， one should remain cognizant of the con-dition and consider it in the differential diagnosis of nontraumatic leg pain. Based on our experience， corrob-oration from previous case reports， and the satisfactory outcome of our case， we advocate the intracapsular micro-enucleation technique when possible for schwannomas.\n\n【6】Keywords： Middle East·Neurilemmoma · Peripheral Nervous System Neoplasms · Peroneal Nerve ·SchwannomatosisSchwannomas， also known as neurilemmomas， neuromas，or Schwann cell tumors， are benign， well-capsulated tumors that arise from Schwann cells of the peripheral nerve sheath . It is the most common benign peripheral nerve sheath tumor(PNST)； localized mainly to the cranial and upper extremity nerves . Its manifestation on lower limb nerves is uncom-mon and accounts for 1% of all cases， with specific involvement of the superficial peroneal nerve being exceedingly rare . In fact， after an extensive search of the literature， there were no available data on the incidence of its occurrence on the super-ficial peroneal nerve， further emphasizing its rarity worldwide.\n\n【7】Several Middle Eastern countries have reported lower limb schwannomas in the common peroneal， deep peroneal， and tibial nerves， which are the most common locations for these tumors to arise from . To date， there have been scarce cases of superficial peroneal nerve schwannomas in the liter-ature， with none reported from the Middle East . In contrast to other published case reports on the same condi-tion， we elaborated and provided comprehensive illustrations on the radiological， surgical， and pathological findings of the case， which is a major distinguishing feature. Here， the authors present a case in Kuwait of a 60-year old man with a painful right superficial peroneal nerve schwannoma that was excised via the intracapsular micro-enucleation technique.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 60-year-old South Asian male farmer with no medical histo ry presented to the neurosurgical clinic with a chronic painful lump on the lateral aspect of the right upper leg of a 2-year duration. The lump preceded the pain. There was a 2-year evo-lution in symptomatology (progressive growth and pain). Over the last 3 months， the lump had become excruciatingly pain-ful. The patient stated that the pain was located at the site of the lump with distal radiation to the right big toe. The pain was described as \"stabbing\"in nature and was aggravated by walking， crouching，leg-crossing， and touching the lump. There were no pain-relieving factors. He denied any history of trau-ma and lumps elsewhere in the body. The family history was absent for neurofibromatosis.\n\n【10】Clinical examination revealed a firm， minimally mobile mass located at the proximal lateral aspect of the right leg， mea-suring approximately 3x2.5 cm. The mass was non-fluctuant and non-pulsatile and did not transilluminate. There were no overlying skin changes. Severe tenderness over the mass was present. There were no sensory or motor deficits. The pain was reproduced with passive and active (with and without re-sistance) dorsiflexion， plantarflexion， and eversion. The Tineltest was positive， eliciting severe pain radiating to the right big toe. No other masses were detected.\n\n【11】Results of investigations including routine blood tests， D-dimer， and Doppler ultrasound were unremarkable. Motor and senso ry nerve conduction studies revealed right superficial perone-al sensory neuropathy with no electrophysiological evidence of motor fascicle involvement and no generalized large fiber polyneuropathy. Further evaluation was performed by magnet-ic resonance imaging (MRI) of the right leg with and without intravenous contrast . MRl showed a well-defined， oval-shaped， heterogeneously enhancing mass measuring 3.2cm in length and 2 cm in width， located just lateral to the fibu-la at the proximal third of the right leg， and exhibiting T1 iso-hypointensity and T2 hyperintensity， respectively. The findings were suggestive of superficial peroneal nerve schwannoma.\n\n【12】Surgery was indicated， and we performed intracapsular enucle-ation of the lesion under microscopy， with images taken during surgery . During surgery， the well-defined true cap-sule that envelopes the schwannoma， which consists of the perineurium of the nerve bundle of origin surrounded by the deep layers of the epineurium， was incised far from any vis-ible nerve stems under microscopy. The tumor was then ex-posed， dissected from the adjacent fascicles， and enucleated while safeguarding adjacent structures， without apparent fas-cicular injury noted after lesion excision. The epineurium of the superficial peroneal nerve was then sutured and layer to layer closure was achieved.\n\n【13】The excised lesion measured 3.5×2.0×1.0 cm and was sent for histopathological assessment， which included the use of special stains. A conclusive diagnosis was made on the basis of histopathological examination， which demonstrated fea-tures that were pathognomonic of a schwannoma as illus-trated .\n\n【14】The postoperative period was uneventful， and the patient re-ported significant improvement in his symptoms. He followed up in the neurosurgical clinic 2 weeks after surgery， where he was ambulating comfortably with no pain and no motor or sensory deficits\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】There have been very few cases of superficial peroneal nerve schwannomas reported worldwide across different continents， with no reports yet on disease epidemiology in the literature. This case raises awareness of that fact that even though low-er limb schwannomas are uncommon， PNST should always be considered as part of the differentials of any patient present-ing with nontraumatic leg pain. It also reinforces the use ofthe intracapsular micro-enucleation technique for schwanno-mas， which has been supported by several studies discussed throughout this report.\n\n【17】Schwannomas can be present in various locations of the pe-ripheral nervous system， but up to 45% of cases occur in the head and neck region， followed by the upper limb nerves . The occurrence in the leg or in the foot and ankle region is rare . Involvement of the sciatic nerve has been report-ed to be the most common location for lower limb schwan-nomas， accounting for approximately 50% of cases .They are solitary in 90% of cases； multiple tumors should raise thesuspicion of syndromic associations (neurofibromatosis type2， schwannomatosis， and carney complex) .Schwannomas usually affect individuals between the ages of 50 to 60 years， with no sex or racial dominance .\n\n【18】Growth of these tumors is slow， and they never traverse through the nerve； remaining in the sheath overlying it . This ex-plains why symptomatology onset， such as severe pain， can appear years later， which occurred in our case， or can pres-ent as a clinically silent incidental finding. In fact， there can be an approximate 5-year delay between symptoms and di-agnosis . In contrast， other documented cases of superficialperoneal nerve schwannomas reported symptom durations of 6， 12， and 36 months . Further analys is of all the scarce reports on superficial peroneal nerve schwannomas re-vealed that the ages of the patients ranged between 40 and65 years， and the most common presenting symptoms were pain and a lump . Sex distribution was also equal in these cases， with 3 female and 3 male patients. Diagnosis was achieved via MRl in most of the cases except 2， which in-terestingly used only ultrasonography to establish the diag nosis . Our current case was not dissimilar in terms of demographics， presenting symptoms， and choice of diagnos-tic modality to most of the aforementioned reported cases.\n\n【19】A systematic-based approach to evaluating patients with non-traumatic leg pain is recommended and involves a detailed history and clinical examination， laboratory tests (especial-ly D-dimer)， followed by ancillary studies， including severalimaging modalities and nerve conduction studies. MRI has been reported to be the preferred imaging technique in the diagnosis of tumors of the peripheral nervous system . Electrophysiological studies before surgery may be of limited use， and their application during surgery is more critical as it helps to identify and preserve the fascicles in relation to the tumor， thereby significantly reducing risk of neurological in-jury during tumor resection .\n\n【20】The criteria for surgery of benign PNST include the following：progressive increase in size of the swelling， increase in pain， and worsening neurological deficit . Tumor size alone is never a criteria for surgical intervention . In the present case， owing to the unbearable nature of the pain， surgery was advised. Surgical techniques used for schwannomas can range from subtotal excision (50% or more) to gross total excision(>90% of the tumor)， leaving behind the tumor capsule ad-herent to the fascicles (ie，intracapsular excision) to completeexcision of the proximal and distal nerve stems of the tumor， including its capsule (ie， extracapsular excision) .\n\n【21】Extracapsular enucleation is one of the operative techniques used in schwannoma surgery . However， by removing the capsule that is adherent to the fascicles， the risk of fas-cicular injury and postoperative neurological deficit is high-er . For that reason， in our case， we used the intracap-sular microscopic enucleation technique with en bloc resection， as this has been shown to be superior to the extracapsular ex-cision technique in terms of providing satisfactory results with a low risk of nerve injury and postoperative neurological defi-cits . This technique has also been performed on a similar reported case of superficial peroneal nerve schwanno-ma with satisfying outcomes . It was also proposed that en bloc resection is not advised and instead intracapsular piece-meal micro-enucleation (\"tumor resected piece by piece\") is considered safe and reliable since the main purpose of schwan-noma surgery is for symptomatic relief rather than tumor exci-sion . This technique has also been supported by another large study involving 422 schwannoma cases， which preferred to excise large tumors by piecemeal debulking .\n\n【22】Schwannomas can be completely excised without major loss of function and without recurrence. However， meticulous dis-section using microscopy is required in large-sized schwanno-mas， as was done in the present case， since the risk of fascic-ular injury and neurological deficit after surgery seems to be higher in these cases . Intraoperative electrophysiolog-ical monitoring may also be crucial in preventing neurologi-cal deficits . Surgical removal of peripheral nerve tumors should be performed by a surgeon with microsurgical and pe-ripheral nerve experience to minimize serious iatrogenic nerve injury and postoperative morbidity.\n\n【23】Classic schwannoma， which was seen in the current case， is the most common type， but several variants exist and include ancient， cellular， melanotic， and plexiform schwannomas . The histopathological appearance of classical schwannomas is described as having a “biphasic pattern\" with 2 distincthistological regions： Antoni A tissue is characterized by hy-percellular spindle cells， that can form palisading rows with an acellular zone in-between (Verocay bodies)； and Antoni B tissue shows a hypocellular pattern with a background of loose connective tissue . A well-formed collagenous cap sule and hyalinized vessels are also consistent findings . Immunohistochemical staining for 5100 protein is a useful marker to identify neoplasms derived from Schwann cells and was used in the present case to further support the diagno-sis . Malignant transformation of benign schwannoma is uncommon， but they can occur and account for 5% to 10% of all soft-tissue sarcoma \n\n【24】The prognosis is excellent after adapted surgical management with sparing of nerve fascicles . Recurrence of schwanno-mas after total excision is rare， but most importantly， patients should be thoroughly counseled before surgery on the poten-tial occurrence of neurological deficits .\n\n【25】Conclusions\n\n【26】Schwannomas are benign PNSTs， which rarely ever occur on the superficial peroneal nerve. With this rare case reported from the Middle East region， we aimed to share our experience， contrib-ute further data to the literature， and consolidate the paucity of literature available worldwide. Lower limb schwannomas are overlooked， but despite their rarity， one should remain aware of the condition and consider it as part of the differential diag-nosis in patients presenting with nontraumatic leg pain. Based on our experience with this case and corroboration from pre-vious case reports， we highly advocate the intracapsular mi-cro-enucleation technique. Further studies are necessary to in-vestigate the epidemiology of the disease in different cohorts.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Differential diagnosis with other lesions in the sellar/parasellar region， through clinical， histopathological， immunohistochemical， and imaging is challenging but es-sential for adequate treatment.\n\n【2】Case Report： This case report describes a 58-year-old patient with the previous diagnosis of follicular thyroid carcinoma， with metastasis to cervical lymph nodes， bone， and lung， initially evolving to left palpebral ptosis. In the investiga-tion， laboratory tests showed hypopituitarism， and magnetic resonance imaging of the skull showed a supra-sellar formation measuring 2.2x3.5×2.5 cm， which increased in size in a few months. The patient underwent transcranial neurosurgery and subsequent immunohistochemical analysis， which confirmed pituitary metasta-sis of follicular thyroid carcinoma. The patient underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy but died 26 months after the onset of symptoms.\n\n【3】Conclusions： The differential diagnosis of pituitary metastasis from a benign lesion is difficult. Therefore， a careful analysis of the history and clinical evolution， use of complementary imaging tests， and， where possible， the histopath-ological and immunohistochemical analysis of the lesion for diagnostic elucidation are necessary.\n\n【4】MeSH Keywords：\n\n【5】Adenocarcinoma， Follicular · Diabetes Insipidus， Neurogenic· Immunohistochemistry·Pituitary Neoplasms ·ThyroglobulinPituitary metastasis (PM) is a rare condition  in which pa-tients may present symptoms related to hypopituitarism， mass effect， and diabetes insipidus . Despite advances in imaging modalities， tumors that metastasize to the pituitary gland may be difficult to differentiate from an adenoma . The preva-lence of PM from thyroid carcinoma is around 2%， and the treatment options in these cases are radiotherapy，iodotherapy， chemotherapy， and/or surgery； although they do not increase survival，they allow better quality of life for the patient .\n\n【6】We report a rare case of PM from thyroid carcinoma in a58-year-old male patient who initially developed palpebral ptosis， and the definitive diagnosis was only possible with immunohistochemistry.\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】A 58-year-old male patient sought care at University Hospital of the Universidade Federal do Maranhao (HUUFMA) in Sao Luis， in the Brazilian state of Maranhao， in April 2016， com-plaining of a holocranial headache， retroorbital pain， and left visual acuity worsening， associated with ipsilateral eyelid pto-sis， which began 8 months before.\n\n【9】When checking his medical history， the patient informed us about his previous diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma. The patient had undergone a subtotal thyroidectomy at another hospital in August of 2013， with an unknown histopathological result and without adequate medical follow-up. Eighteen months af-ter the first surgery， a cervical ultrasound performed due to the appearance of cervical lymphadenopathy showed bilater-al thyroid nodules. Cervical lymph node biopsy showed epi-thelioid lesion， and immunohistochemistry results were com-patible with thyroid follicular carcinoma (FTC) metastasis with thyroglobulin， thyroid/lung transcription factor (TTF1)， and pos-itive proliferative cell index (Ki-67：40%).\n\n【10】The patient then underwent total thyroidectomy with neck lymph node dissection in October of 2015. The histopatholog-ical analysis of 46 lymph nodes showed metastatic spread to34 of them with a solid epithelial neoplasia compatible with FTC. The immunohistochemistry analysis revealed expression for CD56+ and thyroglobulin， consistent with extensively in-vasive FTC\n\n【11】In the follow-up， the patient underwent staging examinations. The computed tomography (CT) scan showed multiple nodular formations in the pulmonary parenchyma， the largest (2.0 cm) being in the left middle lobe. It also presented massive lymph-adenopathy in para-aortic topography， measuring 4.5 cm. Anexpansive process affecting soft parts and the sternum bone measuring 5.7x4.9 cm with pathological fracture was also ob-served. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the skull， dating from March 2016， showed an enlarged suprasellar formation measuring 2.2x3.5×2.5 cm ， with a weighted image in T1 and T2 and intense contrast enhancement， compromis-ing the left cavernous sinus， suggesting pituitary adenoma. At the time， serum thyroglobulin was 30 000 ng/dL and cal-citonin was less than 2 ng/dL The patient then received an iodine dose of 250 mCi， and the post-dose full-body inves-tigation only showed uptake in the anterior cervical region， without distant capture.\n\n【12】Due to left amaurosis and worsening of right-side vision， the patient sought care at HUUFMA and was admitted in August of 2016. He complained of dizziness， nausea， and episodes of diarrhea. In the physical examination， multiple lymph nodes in the right and left cervical region were observed， in addition to the left supraclavicular lymph node and mass in the bone re-gion of the sternum， which was hardened， fixed， and painless. Laboratory tests showed suppressed thyroid-stimulating hor-mone (TSH)， mildly elevated prolactin， hypogonadotropic hypo-gonadism， hypocortisolism， and hypoparathyroidism .\n\n【13】The MRI of the sella turcica revealed a suprasellar image mea-suring 4.1x5.1x5.0 cm . New staging showed lesions in the pulmonary parenchyma and sternum， multiple cervical nodules， and a secondary implant in the acetabular region. The patient then underwent transcranial neurosurgeryand developed diabetes insipidus postoperatively. The histo-pathological of the pituitary mass demonstrated solid epithe-lial pattern neoplasia with similar characteristics to the lymph nodes and thyroid， composed of cells with regular nuclei and eosinophilic/oncocytic cytoplasm. The immunohistochemis-try study showed thyroglobulin expression， paired box gene8 (PAX8)， and TTF1， and was negative for pituitary hormones. Those findings were consistent with PM from thyroid carcinoma.\n\n【14】Table 1. Laboratory tests of the patient and their respective reference values.\n\n|  | Results  | Reference  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| lestosterone  | <0.025 ng/mL  | (1.93-7.40)  |\n| Follicle-stimulating hormone(FSH)  | 1.37mUI/mL  | (1.5-12.4)  |\n| Luteinizing hormone (LH)  | 1.18mUI/mL  | (1.7-8.6)  |\n| Prolactin  | 18.79 ng/mL  | (4.04-15.2)  |\n| Free T4 (Thyroxine)  | 19.24 pmol/L  |   |\n| Thyroid-stimulating hormone(TSH)  | 0.02 mU/L  | (0.51-4.9)  |\n| Cortisol 8：00  | 3.3 ug/dL  | (6.7-22.6)  |\n| Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)  | 12.2 pg/mL  | Up to 46  |\n| Parathyroid hormone (PTH)  | 1 pg/mL  |   |\n\n【16】The oncology team joined the treatment and the tyrosine ki-nase inhibitor sorafenib 800 mg/day was used by the patient for 5 months but was discontinued due to hepatotoxicity and clinical worsening.\n\n【17】The MRI of the sella turcica performed 5 months after the sur-gery showed a still voluminous intra- and supra-sellar expan-sive lesion measuring 4.6×5.1×5.1 cm . The chest CT revealed a volumetric increase of the retrosternal mediastinal lesion and a reduction in the number of pulmonary lesions， with stabilization of the more extensive lesions.\n\n【18】In follow-up with oncology， radiotherapy was provided for bone and cervical lesions， but these continued evolving with little improvement. After 12 months of surgery，radiotherapy was provided for PM. However， after beginning the sessions， the patient died.\n\n【19】Metastatic tumors of the pituitary and sellar region occur in 1%to 3.6% of cancer patients . The most common malignan-cy with PM is lung cancer in men and breast cancer in wom-en . Usually， they affect patients in the sixth or seventh decade of life， with no clear sex predominance . Other pi-tuitary metastases have already been reported， such as pros-tate tumors， renal， gastrointestinal， thyroid， and other prima-ry sites . Thyroid carcinoma metastasis to the pituitary gland is rare ， and accounts for only 2% of PM .\n\n【20】Thyroid carcinoma is divided into 4 main subtypes： papillary， follicular， medullary， and anaplastic . The most common is papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC)， followed by follicular thy-roid carcinoma (FTC) . In the latter， the main route of dis-semination is hematogenous， resulting in metastases to dis-tant areas， mainly bones and lungs， and rarely pituitary. In the case described， the patient was a man in the sixth decade of life with a diagnosis of PM from FTC.\n\n【21】Metastatic tumors may involve the pituitary by hematogenous dissemination， direct invasion of metastasis from the skull base， or meningeal spread through the suprasellar cisterna . As the neurohypophysis is directly exposed to the arterial cir-culation， PM has a predilection for it . Metastatic inoc-ulation of the adenohypophysis is usually a result of the con-tiguous dissemination from the posterior lobe .\n\n【22】Pituitary metastases from thyroid carcinoma tend to be fast-growing parasellar lesions that destroy the pituitary tissue or compress the pituitary stem . In our case， it was difficult to determine the mode of propagation given the rapid and ag-gressive growth of the carcinoma； also， there was no report of impairment of skull base bones in the imaging studies.\n\n【23】Clinically， suspicion of metastases is warranted in patients with rapid onset and progressive symptoms， regardless of history of malignancy . Presentation often includes polyuria，poly-dipsia， headache， hypopituitarism， visual field defects， and cra-nial nerves lesions . The vast majority of patients with PM have diabetes insipidus .However， if the anterior pituitary function is impaired， diabetes insipidus may be hid-den due to the reduction of glucocorticoid function， becoming evident after starting corticosteroid treatment .\n\n【24】A decrease in the presence of diabetes insipidus in cases of PM from thyroid carcinoma has been reported in the litera-ture， although the reasons for such an uncommon presenta-tion have not been clearly established. A possible hypothesis is that PM from thyroid carcinoma tends to initially exhibit a high-er parassellar growth in relation to the intrassellar growth . Parasellar growth causes impairment mainly of cranial nervespresent in the cavernous sinuses； clinical manifestations of dip-lopia， ptosis， or unilateral ophthalmoplegia rapidly progressive with retroorbital pain resulting from such impairment are the initial presentation of these cases .\n\n【25】Intrasellar growth， in turn， destroys the pituitary tissue， with compression of the pituitary stem and consequent hormonal production loss . Hypopituitarism in cases of metastasis may also result more frequently from hypothalamic invasion than adeno-pituitary invasion . Clinically， the symptoms of ad-enohypophysis dysfunction are usually hidden by the signs of systemic disease due to malignancy . Hyperprolactinemia was found in 6.3% of pituitary metastases and is generally at-tributed to the compression of the stem .\n\n【26】Table 2 summarizes some clinical findings of the 14 cases (in-cluding ours) of PM from FTC found in the literature. Diabetes insipidus was present in only 1 of the 14 cases， showing the different behavior of the FTC metastasis. In 8 of the 14 cases. the cranial nerves were affected， and hypopituitarism was re-ported in the initial investigation in only 3 cases. In the case reported here， the patient presented symptoms related to mass effect， hypopituitarism， and left ptosis， characterizing the in-volvement of the oculomotor nerve. Diabetes insipidus was a post-surgical complication.\n\n【27】Despite advances in imaging methods， tumors that metasta-size to the sellar/parasellar region may still be difficult to dif-ferentiate from pituitary adenoma . Metastatic tumors can mimic a variety of lesions in the sellar region， confusing diagnosis .\n\n【28】Computed tomography and MRl are sensitive but non-specific imaging modalities . Computed tomography usually shows hyperdense or isodense， homogeneous， or non-presence of cystic degeneration， hemorrhage， or necrosis . In an MRI， it shows as an isointense or hypointense mass in T1 with a hy-perintense signal in T2 and homogeneous enhancement after contrast . However， Mayret al.  showed the major-ity of PMs are isointense in T1 and T2 images.\n\n【29】Changes such as metastatic lesions in another area of the cen-tral nervous system， invasion of the cavernous sinus， sclerot-ic changes around the sella turcica and clivus， isointense sig-nal in both T1 and T2 images， and loss of the hypersignal of the neurohypophysis have been useful in the differentiation of benign， metastatic lesions . An intra- and suprasellar tumor dumbbell-shaped indentation at the diaphragm level may also be indicative of PM .\n\n【30】Histopathological analysis of PM may indicate pituitary adeno-ma， and immunohistochemistry is required for diagnostic con-firmation . Thyroid follicular carcinomas exhibit a variablemorphology， from the presence of small or medium follicles containing colloid to a trabecular or solid growth pattern . The latter tends to be more frequent in invasive FTCs but may also occur in extremely invasive FTCs . The histopathologi-cal of the neurosurgery product was compatible with solid ep-ithelial neoplasia with characteristics like the neoplasia seen in the cervical and thyroid lymph nodes.\n\n|  |  | Pituitary hyposecretion  | DI  | NCS  | Other  | Treatment  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cases  | Age， sex  | syndrome  | Initial  | I，IV，VI  | metastases  | Treatment  |\n| Lim et al.   | 65，F  | Yes  | Yes  | NO  | Lung bone  | Neurosurgery  |\n|   |  |  |  |  |  | lodotherapy  |\n| Matyja et al.   | 53，F  | NO  | NO  | Yes (VI)  | Cervical bone  | Neurosurgery  |\n| 17  |  |  |  |  |  | Radiotherapy  |\n| Aleyadeh et al.   | 49，F  | NO  | NR  | NO  | Cervical bone  | Neurosurgery  |\n| |  |  |  |  |  | lodotherapy  |\n| Vianello et al.   | 61，F  | Yes  | NO  | NO  | Lung bone  | Biopsy TE  |\n| 22  |  |  |  |  |  | Radiotherapy lodotherapy  |\n| Chhiber et al.   | 65，F  | NO  | NO  | Yes (Ⅲ)  | Bone  | Neurosurgery  |\n| 23  |  |  |  |  |  | lodotherapy  |\n| Prodam et al.   | 45，F  | NO  | NO  | Yes (Ⅲ)  | Cervical bone  | Neurosurgery  |\n| |  |  |  |  |  | lodotherapy  |\n| Yilmazlar et al.   | 43，F  | NO  | NO  | NO  | Lung bone  | Neurosurgery  |\n| |  |  |  |  |  | lodotherapy  |\n| Chrisoulidou et al.   | 60，M  | NO  | NR  | Yes (Ⅲ)  | NO  | NeurosurgeryRadiotherapy  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  | lodotherapy  |\n| Simon 2004， (apud Lim 2015 )  | 23，F  | NO  | NO  | Yes (IV)  | NO  | Neurosurgerylodotherapy  |\n| Kucuk 2002 et al.  | 44， F  | NR  | NR  | NR  | Nr  | NR  |\n| 25  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Ochiai et al.   | 62，F  | NO  | NO  | Yes III，VI  | NO  | Neurosurgery  |\n| 26  |  |  |  |  |  | lodotherapy  |\n| Kistler et al.   | 50，M  | NR  | NO  | Yes  | Bone  | Neurosurgery  |\n| 27  |  |  |  | (Ⅲ)  |  | lodotherapy  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  | Radiotherapy  |\n| Trunnell et al.   | 42， F  | NR  | NO  | NO  | Nr  | lodotherapy  |\n| 28  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Our case   | 58，M  | Yes  | NO  | Yes (Ⅲ)  | Bone cervical lung  | Neurosurgery lodotherapy  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  | Chemotherapy  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  | Radiotherapy  |\n\n【32】DI -diabetes insipidus； CNs - cranial nerves； NR- not reported； F-Female； M-Male； TE -transsphenoidal.\n\n【33】In immunohistochemistry tests， TTF1 and thyroglobulin are useful for distinguishing between thyroid carcinoma and pul-monary adenocarcinoma . Thyroid transcription factor1 is a marker of immunohistochemistry used to confirm lung and thyroid carcinoma， while thyroglobulin is a thyroid carci-noma marker . The immunohistochemistry of our pa-tient's pituitary lesion was positive for TTF1， thyroglobulin， and PAX8， confirming PM from FTC.\n\n【34】Tre atment of metastases of thyroid carcinoma includes surgery radiotherapy， iodoteraphy， and chemotherapy . Neurosurgical exploration may lead to significant symptomatic relief， confir-mation of diagnosis， and improvement in quality of life， but without an increase in life expectancy . Total resection iscomplicated due to increased tumor vasculature and local in-vasiveness . Surgical treatment should be followed by local radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy . The morbidity of sur-gery and radiotherapy includes hypopituitarism， diabetes insip-idus， and visual disturbances， and consciousness disorders .\n\n【35】Table 2 shows that the primary treatment in the cases already reported was neurosurgery. Our patient underwent neurosur-gery because of the compressive effect of the lesion on the op-tic chiasm， and， later， chemotherapy and radiotherapy for cer-vical， bony， and pituitary metastases were indicated.\n\n【36】Chemotherapy for metastatic thyroid carcinoma has a limited role due to low response and significant adverse effects . Radioiodine therapy is also an alternative； however， in patients with poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma， there is the re-duced uptake of 131iodine， which reduces its effectiveness .\n\n【37】Despite aggressive therapy， even in patients without other metastasis in the initial assessment， the prognosis is poor for patients with thyroid carcinoma metastasis to the pitu-itary gland . Patients with a single metastasis of the sellar/parasellar region tend to have a better outcome . In contrast， advanced age at diagnosis decreases survival .\n\n【38】Control of the primary tumor directly affects survival .

A laparoscopic appendectomy was then per-formed along with resection of the nodule located in the mesoappendix， which was confirmed to be a splenic tissue based on histopathological examination.\n\n【2】Conclusions： Abdominal splenosis is not an uncommon condition in patients with a history of splenic injury. However， the involvement of the mesoappendix， which may or may not contribute to acute inflammation of the appen-dix， is very rare.\n\n【3】MeSH Keywords： Appendicitis · Splenectomy·Splenosis\n\n【4】Splenosis is a benign condition that is defined as an auto-transplantation of viable splenic tissue onto a vascularized sur-face. This condition develops following splenic injury through traumatic rupture or splenectomy， which results in seeding or hematogenous spread of the detached splenic pulp cells. The auto-transplanted splenic cells derive their blood supply from adjacent structures and subsequently differentiate into mature splenic tissues. Although it is an uncommon condi-tion， it affects approximately two-thirds of all patients with traumatic splenic rupture . Herein， we present a case of a middle-aged male patient who presented with symptoms consistent with acute appendicitis； a subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed its diagnosis and further dem-onstrated multiple abdominal nodules， one of which was adja-cent to the appendix. Subsequently， the patient underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy along with resection of the nod-ule in the mesoappendix. A histopathological examination ofthe resected tissue indicated the presence of encapsulated splenic tissue along with acute appendicitis.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】A 40-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a 2-day history of generalized abdominal pain that had localized to the right lower abdomen at the time of admis-sion. He described the pain as sharp，constant， and being ex-acerbated by movement. Furthermore， he reported no bowel or urinary symptoms or subjective history of fever. The patient underwent an open splenectomy 20 years ago for a splenic in-jury resulting from a fall from height. He also gave a history of gastritis associated with Helicobacter pylori that was resolved successfully with triple therapy.\n\n【7】Upon presentation， he was afebrile， and his blood pres-sure， pulse rate， and respiratory rate were observed to be126/78 mmHg， 89 beats per minute， and 12 breaths per min ute， respectively. The abdominal examination revealed a left paramedian scar from previous exploratory laparotomy. There was a localized tenderness in the right lower quadrant with no peritoneal signs. Additionally， the patient’s blood analysis re-vealed a hemoglobin level of 15.9 g/dL， a leukocyte count of14.4x10/mL with a left shift (88% neutrophils)， and a platelet count of 497x103/mL， with his levels of urea， electrolytes，and liver enzymes found to be within the normal ranges. The uri-nalysis revealed no abnormalities. A peripheral blood smear showed no Heinz or Howell-Jolly bodies.\n\n【8】A CT scan of the abdomen was further performed to confirm the diagnosis of suspected acute appendicitis . A mildly distended appendix with homogenous hyperenhance-ment of the appendiceal wall with no stranding of adjacent fat or extraluminal fluid collection was observed， which indicated early acute appendicitis. Additionally， a surgically absent spleenand the presence of multiple intra-peritoneal， well-defined nod-ules of soft tissue density suggested splenosis； the largest nod-ule was measuring 4.2x3.3x3.2 cm. Notably， one of the nod-ules was observed to be adjacent to the tip of the appendix.\n\n【9】Given the aforementioned clinical and radiological findings， the patient was then prepared for a laparoscopic appendec-tomy. The surgery was performed under general anesthe-sia with the patient placed in a supine position， and 3 ports were inserted to carry out the procedure. After establishing the pneumoperitoneum and introducing trocars， careful ad-hesiolysis was performed. The diagnostic exploration revealed multiple lobulated， and hypervascular nodules of variable size， which were consistent with splenosis . The largest nodule was embedded in the adhesion area of the previous laparotomy site. A resection of the edematous appendix along with the adjacent splenic nodule was successfully performed， and a histopathological examination showed normal splenictissue with red and white pulp  along with acute ap-pendicitis. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications and was discharged on the second postopera-tive day with no active complaints during the follow-up visit.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Splenosis was first described by Albrecht in 1896 and the term itself was coined by Buchbinder and Lipkopff in 1939 . A dis-tinction must first be made here between accessory spleen， which is another type of ectopic splenic tissue， and spleno-sis  .\n\n【12】While the typical site for splenosis is the abdomen， it is known to also occur at various locations. Abdominal splenosis， for instance， has been observed on the serosal surfaces of the small intestine and colon， mesentery， greater omentum， pari-etal peritoneum， undersurface of the diaphragm， stomach， pancreatic tail， and even inside the liver and the kidney. A study by Lin et al. demonstrated that the left upper abdominal quad-rant is the most frequent site of splenosis . Additionally，diaphragmatic rupture appears essential for the development of thoracic splenosis that allows for the seeding of splenic cells into the thoracic cavity resulting in solitary or multiple pleu-ral-based nodules. However， a few cases ofthoracic splenosis without diaphragmatic rupture have also been reported . It is estimated that thoracic splenosis has been observed in one-fourth of abdominal splenosis cases. Splenosis can also develop in the pelvis and the pelvic organs. The hypothesis in which splenic pulp cells may survive after seeding has also been demonstrated in experimental studies； however， it is in-sufficient to explain the occurrence of splenosis in certain ex-ceptional locations， including the brain .\n\n【13】As the vast majority of cases are asymptomatic and are inci-dentally identified through imaging， the time between the in-cidence and development of splenosis is still unclear. However， the average interval between splenectomy and development of splenosis has been reported to be approximately 2 decades . The site and size of the lesions also influence the clinical pre-sentation of splenosis. The nodules are typically small in size due to their limited blood supply. They are generally less than3 cm in diameter . However， nodules may grow as large as13 cm in diameter . In our case， the size of the nodules was consistent with splenosis. Splenosis might be misdiagnosed as benign or malignant neoplasms such as metastatic dis-ease， and this may lead to unnecessary invasive procedures.\n\n|  | Splenosis  | Accessory spleen  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Etiopathogenesis  |  | Congenital： failure of fusion of  |\n| Etiopathogenesis  | Acquired： direct seeding or hematogenousspread of splenic pulp cells following splenicinjury  | mesenchymal cells during embryonic  |\n|  | Acquired： direct seeding or hematogenousspread of splenic pulp cells following splenicinjury  | development  |\n| Number  | Usually multiple  | Usually solitary  |\n| Size  | Usually small  | Varies  |\n| Location  | Varies  | Near spleen  |\n| Capsule  | No smooth muscle component  | Elastic muscular capsule  |\n| Histology  | Hilum Trabecular Structure  | Present  |\n|  | Less prominent  | More prominent  |\n| Blood supply  | Parasitized  | Splenic artery  |\n\n【15】Abdominal splenosis may also present clinically with abdomi-nal pain， intestinal obstruction， and hydronephrosis and unusu-ally with gastrointestinal bleeding. Acute abdominal pain may develop from splenosis torsion and infarction. Intussusception has also been described as an etiology of abdominal pain in a patient with abdominal splenosis . Hydronephrosis may develop as a consequence of external compression of ureters by the splenic nodules . Adhesive bands of splenic nod-ules could result in intestinal obstruction or acute appendici-tis. Splenic implant hematoma following trauma may also oc-cur . Gastrointestinal bleeding is specifically attributed to the presence of poorly formed capsule of splenosis which pre-disposes it to a spontaneous or traumatic rupture， resulting in occult or massive bleeding . Similarly， thoracic spleno-sis may present clinically with chest pain， cough， or hemop-tysis . Pelvic splenosis may present in a clinical picture that mimics gynecological conditions， including endometrio-sis . In our case， the clinical presentation of acute appen-dicitis may be related to the splenosis nodule despite that it did not cause any obstruction， as evident by imaging. We pre-sume that the presence of splenic nodule in the mesoappen-dix， because of its parasitized blood supply， could have result-ed in ischemia to the appendix. Such ischemia can cause acute appendicitis . However， this is just speculation， as the co-existence could be merely incidental.\n\n【16】The mesoappendix is considered a rare site of pathology . Very few cases of acute appendicitis have been reported in association with abdominal splenosis ； however， only 2 cases of sple-nosis involving the mesoappendix has been described .\n\n【17】The absence of Howell-Jolly bodies or siderocytes in the peripheral blood smear is suggestive of the presence of func-tional splenic tissues. The CT scan can demonstrate a mass with a tissue density similar to that of the normal spleen， while magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can demonstrate an inter-mediate intensity on both T1-and T2-weighted images with re-stricted diffusion to water . The presence of cystic lesions is attributed to central necrosis that is due to the inadequate blood supply . The diagnosis can further be confirmed us-ing a functional imaging study which is a sensitive and nonin-vasive method. Technetium-99m heat-denatured erythrocytes scintigraphy is considered to be the most specific nuclear study technique that allows for the differentiation of hepatic tissue from splenic tissue. Scintigraphy with Technetium-99m sulfur colloid and indium-111-labeled platelets are considered alterna-tive diagnostic methods but also have lower sensitivity . Ferumoxide-enhanced MRI has been reported to detect splenic tissue as it demonstrates a brief increase in T2-signal intensity proceeded by a characteristic decrease . The diagnosis of sple-nosis may be confirmed via these imaging modalities， thus pre-cluding the need for invasive diagnostic procedures. However， for our patient， such imaging studies were not performed due to the acute nature of the presentation. Additionally， the as-sociated risk of sepsis in post-splenectomy patients was con-sidered. If nuclear studies are unavailable， a pathologic analy-sis of the lesions would be required for an accurate diagnosis. It should be noted， however， that the results of fine-needle aspi-ration might be misleading for the diagnosis of lymphoma .\n\n【18】As splenosis is a benign condition and it may have some im-munologic protection against encapsulated bacteria ， it does not require treatment in most cases. Surgical resec-tion， either open or laparoscopic， should be performed only if required. In our case， only the nodule located in the mesoap-pendix was resected.\n\n【19】Abdominal splenosis is not an uncommon condition in patients with a history of splenic injury and splenectomy. However， the involvement of the mesoappendix， which may or may not contribute to acute inflammation of the appendix， is very rare. Splenosis should be considered in the proper clinical settings and it should not distract away from the underlying etiology of acute abdomen.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Percutaneous procedure by Interventional radi-ologist was required for retrieval of the guidewire.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】Guide wire related complications are rarely reported， but are significantly associated with mortality and mor-bidity. The use of ultrasound guidance placement of PICC lines decreases the risk of complications， provides better optimal vein selection， and enhances success.\n\n【6】MeSH Keywords： Catheterization， Central Venous· Foreign Bodies · Radiography， Interventional·Ultrasonography\n\n【7】Abbreviations： PICC-peripherally inserted central catheter； PICCS- peripherally inserted central cathetersPeripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) provide imme-diate venous access to inpatient and outpatient adult and pe-diatric patients. Approximately three million PICCs are placed annually in the United States . Most PICCS are placed by appropriately trained nurses under ultrasound guidance. PICC-related complications include bleeding， phlebitis， celluli-tis， thrombus， pain during infusion， air embolism， and cathe-ter tip migration. A rarely reported PICC-related complication is a missing guide wire， which can result in arrhythmias， in-travascular entrapment of wires， embolization of wire frag-ments， and vessel perforation. Use of ultrasound before and after placement of PICCs helps prevent this complication . We present a case of a retained guide wire that was inciden-tally found with bedside ultrasound.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 50-year-old Hispanic male was admitted to the intensive care unit for alcohol intoxication. Upon admission， the patient was confused and unable to provide any meaningful details. His previous records showed that he had comorbidities including benign essential hypertension， paroxysmal atrial fibrillation， non-ischemic cardiomyopathy， and multiple hospitalizations for delirium tremens. He had a 15-vear history of alcohol mis-use and failed multiple detox attempts. He had never smoked tobacco and did not have any other toxic habits. He had no reported allergies. His medications included thiamine， folate， aspirin， metoprolol， iron， and multivitamin supplements. He lived alone and lacked strong social support.\n\n【10】Upon presentation， physical examination revealed a confused， middle-aged man. Vitals showed a fever of 99°F (37.2℃)，pulse rate of 112 beats per minute， respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute， and blood pressure 110/60 mm Hg. Oxygen sat-uration was 95% in ambient air. He had conjunctival pallor， mild jaundice， and was tremulous. Abdominal examination revealed no hepatosplenomegaly or ascites. There was bilat-eral air entry on auscultation of lungs with no adventitious sounds. Precordial examination revealed normal heart sounds with holosystolic apical grade IIl/VI murmur. His neurologi-cal examination showed no focal neurological deficits with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13. On initial presentation， his labs were significant for neutrophilic leukocytosis， macrocyt-ic anemia， chronic thrombocytopenia， abnormal liver func-tion tests， and hyponatremia. His chest radiography showed right lower lobe infiltrate. He was managed for alcohol intox-ication， electrolyte imbalances， rhabdomyolysis， and aspira-tion pneumonia. The next day， the patient developed hypox-ic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilator support. He was managed for septic shock due to methicillin-sensitivestaphylococcal pneumonia and required placement of a pe-ripherally inserted central line in his left upper extremity for antibiotics and vasopressor administration. After resolution of septic shock， the peripherally inserted central line was re-moved. On day 14 of hospitalization， a routine physical ex-amination revealed left upper extremity swelling that was out of proportion to the rest of the extremities. Immediate bed-side ultrasound performed by the intensivist revealed a for-eign body in the left arm . It was determined to be the retained guidewire from the previously inserted cen-tral line. A chest radiograph confirmed this finding . Interventional radiology was consulted and the guidewire was retrieved under fluoroscopic guidance through a percutane-ous procedure that used a snaring coaxial system . The remainder of his hospitalization was uneventful and thepatient was subsequently discharged to a rehabilitation fa-cility. The patient was followed up in the rehabilitation facil-ity and required frequent hospitalization for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate and acute exacerbation of conges-tive heart failure in the last six months.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】In 1953， Seldinger described a simple， over a guide wire ap-proach for catheter placement . This ultrasound-guided Seldinger technique is most commonly used in the intensive care unit for placement of a central venous catheter，periph-eral venous catheter， arterial catheter， or hemodialysis cath-eter . The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has published recommendations for the use of ultrasound in placing central venous catheters. Ultrasounds can reducecomplications related to venous puncture， but there could still be some complications related to the guide wire， dilator， or catheter .\n\n【13】A PICC is a form of intravenous access that can be used for long-term antibiotics， total parenteral nutrition， vasopres-sors， and chemotherapy. It is a catheter that enters the body through the skin (percutaneously) at a peripheral site and ex-tends to the superior vena cava. To decrease the risk of infec-tion， particularly a blood stream infection， those involved in the management of the PICC must adhere to strict infection control procedures .\n\n【14】There are often challenges during the initial insertion of the guide wire. If the guide wire cannot be inserted or passed eas-ily without resistance， the procedure should be stopped im-mediately， and the guide wire and needle should be removed. The distal portion of the guide wire can detach and resemble a pulmonary embolism . The J-tip of the guide wire can be-come entrapped in a vena cava filter and may cause difficul-ty in retrieving the guide wire . Breakage of the guide wire has been reported in the literature and is not necessarily due to handling mistakes， but may also be attributed to inherent design flaws or manufacturing errors . The retained guide wire in our case was likely a consequence of a fractured guide wire at the time of initial placement of the PICC.\n\n【15】The consequences of PICC complications can be serious and manifest as a deep vein thrombosis， pulmonary embolism， catheter-related blood stream infection， or post thrombotic syndrome. One of the most common complications after plac-ing a PICC line is a deep vein thrombosis in an upper extrem-ity. A comprehensive review conducted by Verso and Agnelli indicated that the incidence of symptomatic upper extremi-ty deep vein thrombosis following the placement of a central vascular access device is between 0-3%. A study conduct-ed by Stokowski et al. demonstrated a significant reduction in thrombosis rates with the uitrasound method (1.9%) com-pared to the palpation method (9.3%). Moreover， successful PICC placements by nurses increased from 76.9% when using the old landmark method to 98.9% when using ultrasound guidance .\n\n【16】Factors that can lead to a missing or misplaced guide wire include inattention， inadequate supervision of trainees， and overtired staff. Operators inexperienced either in method (i.e.， Seldinger technique) or actual central venous cannulation can also lead to misplaced guide wires. It is important to monitor patients for the following signs of guide wire loss： the guide wire missing post-procedure， decreased venous back flow from the lumen， resistance to injection， or a visible guide wire on ultrasound or radiograph .\n\n【17】The use of the Sherlock 3CG Tip Confirmation System provides real-time feedback on catheter tip location， orientation with the use of passive magnets， and cardiac electrical signal de-tection . Placing a PICC with the ECG-guided method has advantages in cost effectiveness， accuracy， and feasibility in situations where x -ray images may be difficult to obtain .\n\n【18】A retained guide wire should be removed as soon as possible to prevent complications like vascular damage， arrhythmias， thrombus， or embolism . Retained guide wires can be re-moved by interventional radiology with the help of endovas-cular forceps . Our case is unique as there are few studies that emphasize missing guide wire after PICC line placement. Use of bedside ultrasound helps in early detection of a for-eign body， leading to its retrieval.\n\n【19】Conclusions\n\n【20】Although central venous catheter placement is a common prac-tice in critically ill patients， we want to emphasize and raiseawareness of potential complications of the catheter. Close su-pervision by a senior person， use of ultrasound before and af-ter placement of catheter， and use of a checklist may help to identify and prevent similar complications. The loss of a guide wire is a completely preventable complication， provided that one always holds onto the tip of the wire.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "3cde54dc-3d42-4a5e-be96-467c1cc34029", "title": null, "text": "【0】Background：\n\n【1】Renal failure is a common presentation of acute myelomonocytic and monocytic leukemia. It is usually the re-sult of a combined glomerular and tubular dysfunction and is associated with a poor prognosis. No guidelines exist for treatment.\n\n【2】Case Report： We herein describe the case of a 78-year-old Caucasian man who presented with acute myeloid leukemia M5， leukostasis with a white count of 340 000/ml， and acute renal failure with a creatinine of 7.7/dL. The patient was initially treated with leukapheresis and 3 days of idarubicin in the setting of continuous renal replacement therapy that resulted in rapid reversal of his renal failure. He then received 7 days of continuous infusion cy-tarabine and went into a complete remission.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】Renal failure may complicate the presentation of AML but can be reversible with treatment. Dose adjustment of the chemotherapy is not needed and the treatment can be greatly facilitated with the use of continuous renal replacement therapy as indicated in our case report. In addition， we emphasize that organ dysfunction， even in elderly patients， is not necessarily a contraindication to aggressive treatment if it is felt to be disease-related and reversible.\n\n【5】MeSH Keywords： Acute Kidney Injury· Cytarabine· Hemofiltration · Idarubicin· Leukemia， Myeloid， Acute·LeukostasisLeukostasis， acute renal failure， and extramedullary tissue in filtration are more likely to be present at diagnosis in patients with acute myelomonocytic and monocytic leukemias (M4 and M5) than in other subtypes of AML and have been asso-ciated with poor prognosis and death within the first week of presentation . The combination of acute renal failure， pro-teinuria，hypokalemia， and hypophosphatemia specifically ap-pears to be characteristic for patients with AML M4 and M5because it is not found in other subtypes and is the result of a combined glomerular and tubular dysfunction.\n\n【6】Although this is a relatively common presentation， there is no good data to guide initial treatment decisions in patients with AML and acute renal failure. In our review of the literature we identified 1 case report describing reversibility of renal fail-ure and tubule dysfunction with chemotherapy treatment in a patient with AML M5 who presented with leukostasis and did not require renal replacement therapy . In another case of a pediatric patient presenting with AML M4 and renal fail-ure， radiation therapy to the kidneys was attempted and ap-parently failed， and then dose-reduced chemotherapy in the setting of hemodialysis reversed the renal failure and induced remission of the leukemia .\n\n【7】We report a case of a patient presenting with AML M5， leu-kostasis， acute renal failure， and hypophosphatemia. To our knowledge this is the first case describing complete revers-ibility of the renal failure and tubule dysfunction after treat-ment of the underlying leukemia with full-dose chemothera-py and in the setting of continuous renal replacement therapy.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 78-year-old Caucasian man with atrial fibrillation， hyperten-sion， and dyslipidemia presented to our service with 2 days of oliguria after a week of fevers， dyspnea， fatigue， and sore throat. Initial laboratory evaluation revealed abnormal blood counts： 340x10// white blood cells (98% blasts)，59x10/l plate-lets， and a 26.9% hematocrit. Serum chemistries were signifi-cant for the following values (in mg/dL unless otherwise not-ed， abnormal values are in bold)： sodium 140， potassium 4.0， chloride 101， bicarbonate 24， blood urea nitrogen 49， creat-inine 7.7， uric acid 16.2， calcium 11.6(11.9 corrected)， phos-phate 0.9， magnesium 2.4， and lactate dehydrogenase 1329IU/L. His urinalysis showed many cellular casts consisting of white cells that had the appearance of blasts.\n\n【10】Chest x-ray showed bilateral infiltrates suggesting leukemic infiltration or infection. A bilateral renal ultrasound showed normal-sized kidneys and no hydronephrosis.\n\n【11】A bone marrow biopsy was performed，showing that 99% of the aspirate cellularity consisted of large cells with large nu-clei， with irregular nuclear containing an open chromatin， prominent nucleoli， moderate nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio； ba-sophilic cytoplasm and occasional cytoplasm vacuoles， con-sistent with blasts. The marrow was packed， with overall cel-lularity approaching 100%. There was an interstitial infiltrate of immature cells consistent with blasts occurring in sheets occupying 99% of marrow cellularity. Cell marker analysis demonstrated that the majority of the cells isolated from the peripheral blood/bone marrow expressed immature an-tigens CD34， HLA-DR， myeloid associated antigens CD117， CD13 (dim)， CD15 (variable)， CD11c， CD64 (subset)，and CD71， whereas lymphoid-associated antigen CD7 and were negative for CD10 (cALLa)， B-cell antigens， other T-cell antigens CD2， CD3， CD5， CD4，CD8， as well as CD33， CD14， CD41， CD56， and Glycophorin A. Overall picture was consistent with AML， FAB subtype M5 without chromosomal abnormalities. FLT3 and NMP1 mutations were negative.\n\n【12】The gravity of his diagnosis was conveyed to the patient and palliative care was offered. The patient， highly functional and still productive in the community， opted for aggressive treat-ment and was admitted to the intensive care unit. He was started on aggressive intravenous hydration (initially 250 ml/hr and then 125 ml/hr of D5W with 150 mEg/L of sodium bicar-bonate)， antibiotics (cefepime)， and hydroxyurea at 1000 mg twice a day. He received rasburicase and underwent 3 ses-sions of leukapheresis. Continuous venovenous hemofiltra-tion with dialysis (CVVHD) was initiated. He was then start-ed on induction therapy with idarubicin at 9 mg/m2 on day 1and 12 mg/m2 on days 2 and 3. By day 4， his white cell count had returned to normal levels， his creatinine had improved to1.3 mg/dL and uric acid to 5.9 mg/dL， and CVVHD was dis continued. On Day 5 he was started on 7 days of cytarabine at 100 mg/m2/day as a continuous infusion. His day 14 bone marrow was ablated， his peripheral counts recovered by day28， and his day 28 marrow showed normal hematopiesis with-out an excess of blasts. His hospital course was complicated by enterococcal bacteremia，candidemia， pulmonary aspergil-losis， and a gastrointestinal bleed， but he recovered and was discharged to home on day 44.\n\n【13】He then underwent consolidation chemotherapy with 6 cycles of low-dose idarubicin and cytarabine. He relapsed 14 months after the time of first remission. He was subsequently rein-duced with clofarabine and cytarabine and went into a second remission. He underwent further consolidation with clofara-bine and cytarabine but relapsed 6 months later. He was re-treated with decitabine but developed a viral gastrointestinal infection that resulted in acute tubular necrosis requiring he-modialysis. Thereafter， he chose palliative care and died 22.5months after his original presentation.\n\n【14】Renal dysfunction and failure is a common presenting sign in patients with acute myelocytic and monocytic leukemia. The etiology of renal failure in patients with AML M4 and M5is multifactorial and the result is a combined glomerular and tubular dysfunction， which is a unique manifestation com-pared to the other types of leukemia . Older studies sug-gested that eventually all patients with M4 and M5 develop proteinuria and about 50% of them develop “azotemia”. A main cause for glomerular dysfunction is direct infiltration of the kidneys by blasts. Enlarged kidneys are a sign of leu-kemic infiltration but patients may also have microscopic in-filtration as indicated by autopsy series in which leukemic in-filtration of the kidneys was found in almost all patients with M4 and M5 .\n\n【15】In addition， patients with AML M4 and M5 have a high se-rum and urine level of lysozyme， thought to originate from the blast cells . Lysozyme directly damages tubule cells， leading to proximal tubular acidosis similar to Fanconi's syn-drome and patients present with proteinuria and with hypo-kalemia and hypophosphatemia despite sometimes having a very high cellular turnover and/or renal failure. (“lysozyme kid-ney\") . In addition patients with myelocytic and mono-cytic leukemia may have hypergammaglobulinemia (in contrast to the hypogammaglobulinemia seen in the other subtypes of AML)， which has also been implicated as a contributing factor to tubular dysfunction .\n\n【16】Spontaneous tumor lysis has in rare cases been described in patients with acute leukemia  and can also lead to acute renal failure at presentation， but the characteristic electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia) associ-ated with the \"lysozyme kidney\" can help distinguish between the 2 syndromes. Another mechanism that can explain renal failure at presentation is leukemic thrombi in the renal vas-culature， but this seems to be rare .\n\n【17】In our patient， the cause of renal failure was most likely mul-tifactorial. He had renal infiltration， as evidenced by the pres-ence of leukemic blast casts， but also had tubular dysfunction with hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia. We did not pursue a kidney biopsy because it would be a significant risk and un-likely to alter management. Instead we used rasburicase to control his uric acid level and initiated CVVHD. Continuous ve-novenous hemofiltration (CVVH) has been used successfully in patients with Burkitt's lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia both to prevent and treat tumor lysis syndrome and to allow for the safe administration of chemotherapy in the setting of renal insufficiency . In theory the slow， con-tinuous removal of metabolites achieved by CVH should bephysiologically superior and better tolerated compared to the intermittent forms of dialysis . If the hemofiltration provid-ed by CWH is not sufficient to remove the metabolites， then continuous dialysis can easily be started in the form of CVVH with dialysis (CVHD).\n\n【18】We decided to treat his underlying leukemia with idarubicin first (slightly dose-reduced only on day 1) because it is hepat-ically cleared and can be safely administered. The dose ad-justment for continuous infusion cytarabine in patients with renal failure has not been established but there is a concern for accumulation of its toxic metabolite Ara-U . In ad-dition， cytarabine is a dialyzable small molecule (243.22 ki-lodaltons - KD) that can be easily removed by CVH， sharp-ly limiting its efficacy . Idarubicin， on the other hand， is a large (533.96 KD)， non-dialyzable molecule . Lysozyme is also a small molecule (15 KD) and it is likely that CVVH con-tributed to the rapid reversal of our patient's renal failure by quickly lowering his lysozyme levels. In addition， a sharp de-cline in the number of lysozyme-producing leukemic cells was achieved with leukapheresis， hydroxyurea， and idarubicin. The end result was a rapid reversal of his renal failure and tubular dysfunction， indicating that the damage induced by leukemic infiltration and lysozyme can be temporary. The return of his renal function to normal allowed us to safely administer the cytarabine after the completion of idarubicin. Administering cytarabine out of sequence did not appear to negatively affect the day 14 or 28 marrow results or overall outcome.\n\n【19】Conclusions\n\n【20】Renal failure due to combined glomerular and tubular dysfunc-tion may complicate the presentation of acute myelocytic and monocytic leukemia but can be rapidly reversible with treat-ment. Dose adjustment of the chemotherapy is not needed and the treatment can be greatly facilitated with the use of contin-uous rena. replacement therapy， as indicated in our case re-port. Because anthracyclines are not renally cleared， they can be administered first， and cytarabine administration can be-gin after the reversal of kidney dysfunction and discontinua-tion of continuous renal replacement therapy. We emphasize that organ dysfunction，even in elderly patients， is not neces-sarily a contraindication to aggressive treatment if it is felt to be disease-related and reversible.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Although rare， hemoglobin cast nephropathy due to hemolysis can be a cause of acute kidney injury in patients with Evans syndrome.\n\n【5】MeSH Keywords：\n\n【6】Acute Kidney Injury· Anemia， Hemolytic · Anemia， Hemolytic， Autoimmune·Purpura， Thrombocytopenic， Idiopathic· ThrombocytopeniaEvans syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by ‘warm’autoimmune hemolytic anemia， autoimmune thrombocyto-penia， and autoimmune neutropenia. Evan and Duane first described the syndrome in 1951 . Evans syndrome is more common in the pediatric population than in adults and is of ten associated with underlying autoimmune disease， connec-tive tissue disease， immune deficiency disorders， lymphopro-liferative disorders， or malignancy of the immune system. Evans syndrome is classified as either primary or secondary， depending on the presence of underlying autoimmune disease or connective tissue disease. Associated diseases include sys-temic lupus erythematosus (SLE)， autoimmune lymphoprolif-erative syndrome (ALPS)， and immune deficiency disorders such as common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)， or lym-phoid malignancy， including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)， and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) . The degree of in-travascular hemolysis in Evans syndrome often results in he-moglobinemia， which may lead to hemoglobin cast nephrop-athy， acute tubular necrosis (ATN)， and acute kidney injury .\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】A 60-year-old man with a history of hypertension and obstruc-tive sleep apnea presented to an external hospital with sudden onset of severe low back pain and hematuria. He was anemic with initial investigations indicating a hemolytic process. He had acute kidney injury (AKl) and low to normal platelet lev-els. Due to concerns for the presence of thrombotic throm-bocytopenic purpura (TTP)， he was treated with high-dose steroids (methylprednisolone 1 g) and underwent plasma ex-change (PLEX). During his hospitalization， he developed acute renal failure with an acute rise in creatinine from 1.5 mg/dL to 7 mg/dL and a low urine output that required treatment with hemodialysis.\n\n【9】He was transferred to our hospital for further management. His recent medical history included a sore throat and body aches two weeks previously， recent use of ibuprofen， and jaundice that developed during the previous week. He reported a simi-lar history more than one year previously， which had been as-sociated with low blood counts. At that time， he was told that he had a viral illness that spontaneously resolved. He was also diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) at the time and was treated with rivaroxaban for three months.\n\n【10】On admission， physical examination showed that he was mild-ly jaundiced with scleral icterus and generalized peripheral edema. There was no evidence of petechiae， skin rash， or oral ulcers. His hemoglobin level had fallen to 6.0 g/dL， with a low haptoglobin of <8 mg/dL， increased serum levels of low-densitylipoprotein (LDL) of >3000 U/L， increased unconjugated total bilirubin of 4.1 mg/dL， and thrombocytopenia with platelet lev-els of 122x103/mcL.Renal failure was identified with the find-ings of serum creatinine (Cr) of 6.27 mg/dL and urinalysis that showed protein (2+)， and blood (3+). An initial peripheral blood smear showed spherocytes with no schistocytes. Serum ferri-tin levels were >40，000 ng/ml，and the white blood cell (WBC) count was 27x10/mcL， indicating a severe inflammatory re-sponse. Given his significant hematological changes and lab-oratory findings of renal failure， the differential diagnosis in-cluded thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)， hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)， systemic rheumatic disease， parox-ysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)， Evans syndrome，sep-sis with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)， and he-mophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH).\n\n【11】Treatment continued with 250 mg and methylprednisolone， and he was referred to the Departments of Hematology and Nephrology. Hematology investigations showed a positive direct Coombs test for autoimmune hemolytic anemia with ‘warm’lgG and C3d antibodies， and antiplatelet antibodies to glycopro-teins GPllb/llla，GPlb/IX， and GPla/lla. He had low ADAMTS-13activity (39%)， which was believed to be low secondary to high levels of free hemoglobin. The patient underwent tests for sec-ondary Evans syndrome and was found to have negative results for antinuclear antibody (ANA)， antineutrophil cytoplasmic an-tibody (ANCA)， extractable nuclear antigen (ENA)， anticardio-lipin antibody， but had no antibodies to lupus anticoagulant， and human immunodeficiency virus (HⅣ). Tests for paroxys-mal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)， the Donath-Landsteiner test for paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria， cold agglutinins， and serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) tests were all negative.\n\n【12】Treatment was commenced with prednisone 1 mg/kg for a to-tal of 30 days and intravenous rituximab 100 mg each week for four weeks. He underwent renal biopsy and histology， which showed hemoglobin cast nephropathy， and immuno-histochemistry showed that the casts were positive for he-moglobin， but there were with histological findings of micro-angiopathy .\n\n【13】Treatment with high-dose steroids and intravenous rituximab reduced hemolysis， improved renal function， and improved urine output. He was discharged from hospital on high-dose prednisone with plans to continue intravenous rituximab and intermittent hemodialysis. Following discharge from hospital， he underwent bone marrow biopsy， which showed mild hypo-cellularity and reduced hematopoiesis with no significant dys-plasia or increased blasts with no evidence of metastatic carci-noma， lymphoma， or granulomas. Flow cytometry showed no evidence of lymphoproliferative disorder or myeloid neoplasm.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Evans syndrome includes warm' autoimmune hemolytic ane-mia and autoimmune thrombocytopenia and is caused by au-toantibodies that result in both platelet dysfunction and red blood cell damage. Evans syndrome occurs more commonly in children but can present in adults， with a mean age of >50years . Evans syndrome is diagnosed in less than 5% of pa-tients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) or au-toimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Evans syndrome is often more challenging to treat than AIHA alone， treatment often requires the use of steroids， and Evans syndrome has a high-er mortality rate than AIHA .\n\n【16】The pathophysiology of Evans syndrome remains unknown， but it is recognized as a condition of immune dysregulation . Recent molecular theories include deficiencies of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4)， lipopolysaccharide responsive beige-like anchor protein (LRBA)， tripeptidyl peptidase 2 (TPP2)， and a reduced CD4/CD8 ratio . Many cases are idiopathic， as was the case with this patient. To determine whether Evans syndrome is primary or idiopathic， underlying causes or sec-ondary causes of Evans syndrome should be excluded. There is an association between Evans syndrome and underlyingimmunohistochemistry of the renal biopsy from a 60-year-old man with Evans syndrome and acute hemoglobin cast nephropathy. (A) Histology of the renal biopsy shows that the renal tubules contain pigmented casts. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).(B) Histology of the renal biopsy shows that the renal tubules contain pigmented casts. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). (C) Im munohistochemistry shows that the renal tubule casts stain positively with antibodies to hemoglobin.\n\n【17】autoimmune and lymphoproliferative disorders， infections that include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)， hepatitis C virus (HCV)， and thrombotic events . In a study reported by Michel et al.， up to 50% of cases of Evans syndrome were as-sociated with an underlying disorder， predominantly SLE . Common variable immunodeficiency was also seen in patients younger than 45 years .Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was the most commonly associated disease in patients >50 years . Although cases may be initially classified as idiopathic， with no underlying cause or association， as in this case， patients may still develop one of the main associated conditions later in life. Therefore， patients diagnosed with Evans syndrome re-quire close hematologic monitoring and follow-up.\n\n【18】Although there is no standard diagnostic approach to labora-tory tests for Evans syndrome， a systematic approach should be taken to screen patients for underlying or associated dis-eases. There is an association between Evans syndrome and underlying systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)， and investi-gations for the presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) and anti-double-stranded DNA should be undertaken . Given that patients with Evans syndrome are at increased risk of throm-botic events， tests for anticardiolipin antibodies and a lupus anticoagulant test should also be considered. Also， an infec-tion screen should be performed to exclude infections with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)， hepatitis B virus (HBV)， and hepatitis C virus (HCV). In the adult age group of patients with Evans syndrome， serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP)，and computed tomography (CT) imaging of the chest， abdo-men， and pelvis should be considered to exclude underlying malignancy， and cancer screening appropriate for age and gen-der should be performed .\n\n【19】First-line treatment consists of high-dose glucocorticoids， such as prednisone， at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg per day. Azathioprine， cyclophosphamide， danazol， and intravenous rituximab are often second-line treatment agents. In previous decades，the classic preferred second-line treatment was splenectomy， but the use of agents such as intravenous rituximab has become the preferred second-line treatments .\n\n【20】In this case， the severity of hemolysis resulted in acute renal failure secondary to heme pigment nephropathy . The degree of hemolysis saturates haptoglobin leaving free hemoglobin to damage the renal tubules. Patients will often have abnormal laboratory findings of anemia， increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)， reduced haptoglobin， and in-creased serum creatinine. Urine dipstick testing may be posi-tive for blood in the absence of erythrocytes.Other urine tests include pigmented granular casts and hemoglobinuria.\n\n【21】Hemolysis-associated hemoglobin cast nephropathy results from direct damage to the renal tubule from heme pigment through several mechanisms . Damage occurs via renal vaso-constriction， direct tubular damage by the inflammatory effect of hemoglobin， and intraluminal cast formation， which plugs the tubules and damages the cells . Hemoglobin pigment nephropathy caused by myoglobin is often seen and best de-scribed as a complication of rhabdomyolysis. Rarely， hemoglobin cast nephropathy occurs following intravascular hemolysis due to sepsis， paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)， valvular heart disease， and malaria . It is rarely seen in association with Evans syndrome alone but has been reported in a pediat-ric case， diagnosed postmortem . Hemoglobin cast nephrop athy has also been reported in an adult woman who was later diagnosed with lupus nephritis， in a case of secondary Evans syndrome . The association between Evans syndrome andacute kidney injury with autoimmune disease or lymphopro-liferative disorder can result in renal damage due to mecha-nisms other than hemoglobin pigment nephropathy . In ad-dition to hemoglobin pigment nephropathy， other uncommon complications associated with Evans syndrome have been re ported， including non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage .\n\n【22】Although rare， Evans syndrome in the adult population should be recognized and patients should be investigated for the presence of underlying hematological and immunological dis-orders. Patients with Evans syndrome are at increased risk of thromboembolic events， autoimmune and connective tissue disorders， and malignancy of the immune system at the time of diagnosis or even years later. Having a systematic diagnos-tic approach and undertaking basic laboratory investigations will help to identify causes and associations， if present， and improve the management of this condition and its complica-tions. Although exceeding rare， hemoglobin pigment nephrop-athy can be a cause of acute kidney injury in Evans syndrome and should be considered in the appropriate clinical context.\n\n【23】Conclusions\n\n【24】This case report has highlighted the importance of the recog-nition and diagnosis of Evans syndrome， as patients are at in-creased risk of underlying hematological and immunological disorders. In Evans syndrome， autoimmune hemolysis may re-sult in hemoglobin pigment nephropathy and acute kidney in-jury. Prompt diagnosis and treatment is important to reduce patient morbidity. A systematic diagnostic approach is help-ful， given that Evans syndrome is rare in the adult population and can be challenging to diagnose. Increased awareness of the rare complications associated with Evan syndrome should be considered in the correct clinical context.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Popular textual references on clinical content have been to clas sic translations from the Greek， most notably by Dr. Emile Littre in France and Dr. Francis Adams  in Scotland . Both were trained in medicine and both pub-lished in the mid-nineteenth century when scientific truths were beginning to flood the medical world， but their transla-tions retained many elements of medieval interpretation and vocabulary. Some recent translations of Hippocratic passages by medical specialists suggest， however， that ancient Hippocratic physicians were more observant and prescient than were their translators until well into the twentieth century .\n\n【5】This paper presents a new translation of a single short chap-ter selected from the Hippocratic treatise， Diseases ll， a work that， focusing on internal medicine， contains much that， on cursory reading， seems to elude common sense. Chapter 12of Diseases II shares that shortcoming， but when parsed more carefully reveals a syndrome associated with pituitary tumors. Validity of the present translation is supported by a recent neu-rosurgical interpretation of chapters 14 and 15 of Diseases I as representing a credible diagnosis and surgical management of an otitis-related brain abscess .\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】(As translated by the author from the Greek of the 1538 Froben edition of the works of Hippocrates ).\n\n【8】Diseases that develop from the head\n\n【9】Whenever it becomes full and it happens that it becomes heat-ed from something， hypesthesia grips the head， and the pa-tient must urinate all the time. Otherwise he suffers as if he had strangury. After 9 days of these symptoms， should some-thing like water or dribble drain from the nose or ears he will recover from the disease and the strangury ceases. By day 20he then will urinate a lot without difficulty and the urine will be pale. And the distress emanating from the head then re-mits， but should the eyes be looked into， the gleam \\[of the eyes， glint\\] is absent and the patient sees faces from only one side. By 40 days he becomes completely healthy.\n\n【10】In many the disease sometimes gradually recurs 7 to 14 years later； the skin of the head is thicker and exhibits edema. Despite little food the skin appears soft and of a good com-plexion， but auditory acuity is decreased.\n\n【11】Whenever you come across a patient with these problems eary in the course of the disease before there is watery drainage down from the nose and/or ears， and ifthere is the same dis-comfort \\[of the head\\]， it is necessary to shave the head and then tie a leather flask filled with water as hot as tolerable to the forehead， refilling the flask when it cools down. But ifthe patient becomes too weak， leave off for a while but do it to him \\[continue it\\] until the tenderness eases. If the patient is constipated， use an enema and hydrate him. \\[remainder of paragraph irrelevantj.\n\n【12】And during that time if there is watery drainage from the nose and the urine is concentrated \\[viscous\\] but the discomfort \\[of the head\\] is easing， the flask on the head is no longer needed， but \\[have him\\] drink the well-washed and warmed diuretic with diluted honey. \\[remainder of the paragraph irrelevant\\].\n\n【13】Should the disease recur， give the patient a vapor bath and in the morning give him some hellebore to drink； and after an interval of whatever you think might be the \\[right\\] time， cleansing the head， give a lower medicine \\[probably a laxa-tive\\]， and scarify the head in 8 places， 2 near the ear， 2 on the forehead， and 2 posteriorly on the head on each side over the occiput， and 2 by the nose near the inner canthus of the eye. Then burn \\[to seal\\] the blood vessels near the ears until the pulsations stop； do this with wedged hot irons， to cauterize across the vessels. In doing this the patient becomes healthy.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】The patient proposed by the examiner presents with facial numbness and headache and might have had a purulent si-nusitis or otitis media eased by spontaneous drainage of pus. But the problem is more complex. The facial numbness (anes-thesia or hypesthesia) suggests cranial nerve V involvement and， because of urinating“very much\" and\"much and easily，\"the patient may have had antidiuretic hormone (ADH) defi-ciency. Strangury is mentioned， but， in contrast to polyuria， strangury is associated with voiding of small amounts of urine. It is likely that the term“strangury\" was used here by the examiner because the patient had a feeling of urgency to uri-nate caused by frequent bladder distention rather than blad-der or urethral irritation associated with the hesitancy， sense of incomplete voiding， and straining at urination that defines strangury. A week or so later such a patient can have a wa-tery trickle from the nose or ear， not descriptions that would suggest purulent drainage. The facial numbness and head-ache then disappear， but the urine remains plentiful and pale(of low specific gravity)， suggesting ongoing diuresis of a hy-potonic urine， but urinary urgency has ceased. At this point the patient is developing a cranial nerve palsy， for on looking into the eyes the normal positioning of the corneal light reflexapparently is not seen by the examiner， indicating asymme-try of gaze has now developed. Concurrently the patient has developed a visual field defect. Diagnostic visual field testing was yet to be invented， and the description that such a patient might see only one-half of faces is probably an incorrect inter-pretation by the examiner. Visual field cuts are common with pituitary tumors. They tend， however， to be bitemporal hemi-anopias， and a homonymous hemianopia is possible but rare. Central scotomas， however， are frequent. These might have pro-duced an image interpreted as \"half a face\". Despite these symptoms the patient was judged healthy a month or so later.\n\n【16】Years later some symptoms described might recur， but now such a patient can have thickened skin of the face that com-presses with fingertip pressure. lt is proposed that the pa-tient has developed myxedema. Along with the skin changes， his hearing is diminished and there is a decrease in caloric re-quirements， both often present in advanced hypothyroidism. A“good” complexion is not how modern physicians would de-scribe the advanced hypothyroidism facies， for the skin tends to be dry and some sallow pallor is often present， but in older textbooks the classical description of hypothyroidism can in-clude a“peaches and cream\" complexion. Furthermore， pal-lor may have seemed less obvious in a Mediterranean popu-lation. Hypothyroidism is more likely than anasarca to explain the skin changes， for edema is not described as pitting (a dis-tinction made in another Hippocratic work)， and dependent edema， ascites， and generalized tissue edema are not de-scribed1. There is a suggestion of chronicity as weakness de-veloped in the intervening years， a vague symptom， but one consistent with hypothyroidism and not attributed to a new problem. Years later， should the proposed patient have an-other exacerbation， the recommendation is scarification and cautery of superficial vessels of the head， thus following the usual Hippocratic practice of surgery as a last resort.\n\n【17】The probable cause of such a relatively acute clinical sequence in an adult is pituitary apoplexy. Hormones that might be af-fected include ADH， oxytocin， and any or all of the anterior pituitary hormones such as thyroid-stimulating hormone and adrenocorticotropic hormone. The role of ADH is postulated as follows： when first seen， the patient’s pituitary tumor was impairing ADH release from the posterior pituitary， which ex-plains the increased urination. Nine days later (after consult-ing the physician?) a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak occurred， one consequence being a decrease in intracranial pressure ei-ther generally or locally， and this， perhaps with a decrease in tumor size from infarction， led to cessation of the headache and a concurrent decrease in pressure on the hypothalamus or posterior pituitary that permitted a correction of the impairedADH release. Urine output， therefore， could have transiently de-creased， presumably for a few days， and been viewed as nor-malized by day 9. Alternatively， the syndrome of inappropri-ate ADH secretion (SIADH) or an element of adrenal or thyroid insufficiency might have masked ADH deficiency， thus mim-icking an improved ADH status . Once the CSF leak spon-taneously ceased， which often occurs， the effect of local pres-sure on the mechanism of ADH release returned， for 11 days later there is extraocular muscle impairment， a visual field de-fect， and resumption of diuresis. Although tumor effects reap-peared，the discomfort of the head did not.\n\n【18】Hippocratic treatment is given in 3 phases. In phase 1， prior to the nasal drainage， the symptoms of headache， hypesthesia， constipation， and polyuria are treated with local heat，hydra-tion， and laxatives. Application of localized heat to the head may have been prescribed to promote drainage and ease pain， just as hot compresses were thought to do when applied to abscesses. Fortuitously， nasal drainage appeared and some symptoms abated. The alternative of ear drainage is inconsis-tent here and may have been merely inferred by the examiner from experience with trauma-induced CSF leaks. In phase 2， therefore， hot compresses were discontinued， and mild ca-thartics started. In phase 3， efforts now shift to scarification and cautery， presumably because it has been decided that no medicinal therapies are effective against the late manifesta-tions of the underlying problem， which， quite remarkably， is still considered to be in the head.\n\n【19】Of the more than 70 works listed under the sobriquet of“Hippocrates，\"most were written between 450-350 BCE. Many are notable for their brevity and sparse commentary， more like quick clinical notes than prolix sophism of the phi-losophers. In the words of Dr. W. H. S. Jones， translator of the first 4 volumes of the Loeb Classical Library series on the works of Hippocrates， \"Not a word is thrown away\". There is no unanimity of opinion that a medical personage now hailed as Hippocrates ever existed， and scholars are convinced that the Hippocratic works are the product of many authors. The clinical case presently under discussion nonetheless inhabits a niche in history to which its credibility can be appended， namely， con-fidence in the approximate dates of its production， mid-fifth century BCE， and confidence that its authors were clinicians that as a group can be designated “Hippocratic.”\n\n【20】The final diagnosis of the present case report is postulated to have been a nonfunctioning pituitary tumor with infarction or hemorrhage， still quaintly termed “pituitary apoplexy，\"and sub-sequent hypothyroidism. But the correctness of the diagnosis is of less interest than the implication that the same patient，\n\n【21】1\\. Different types of edema are described in standard sections of the following Hippocratic works： pitting edema - Internal Affections， section 44； dependent edema\n\n【22】\\- Epidemics III， section 12 under“Constitution；\"anasarca~ Aphorisms ⅧI， p.\n\n【23】or perhaps 2 or 3 patients from whom the clinical sequence was put together， was under medical observation for as long as 14 years， thus allowing what likely was advanced hypothy-roidism to be postulated as a consequence of the much earlier event affecting the head. If true， the continued personal in volvement of one or more local physicians with one or more pa-tients over such a long time suggests a stability of Hippocratic medical practice， a continuity of care， and a method of data collection/preservation that would seem without parallel in ancient times. Support for this inference is provided by other Hippocratic works describing situations where acute events and later， seemingly unrelated， phenomena were considered one illness， such as diphtheria and its paralytic effects，relaps-ing spirochetal fevers， and the association of “critical days”with physiological responses to pathogens .\n\n【24】Seemingly healthy after a month and a half， the patient was assessed as “\"cured，\" just as he was following cautery and scari-fication. Yet when reassessed 7 years later， primary hypothy-roidism was developing. It does underscore the fact that many of the patients identified in Hippocratic clinical works who are claimed to have been “cured\" were， in fact， not cured. Their lat-er consequences may not have been known to the initial phy-sician because of the peripatetic nature of his practice or be-cause the patient died or moved from the region prior to the arrival of a subsequent physician who would be unaware of the ultimate outcome. In the present case， continuity of care appears to have covered as much as 14 years， although one might suppose that the physician who scarified and cauter-ized the patient's head promptly left town after pronouncing the patient as cured.\n\n【25】The question remains， how could the course of such a pro-tracted illness be described in terms that suggest similar ill-nesses had been seen by Hippocratic physicians， thus allow-ing for a filling in， over time， of clinical events covering 14years? The prevalence of“clinically relevant” pituitary tu-mors in Belgium has been reported to be 1 per 1000 per-sons. About one-half were nonfunctioning. If an ancientGreek city-state contained 10 000 persons who might have been visited by Hippocratic physicians (excluding slaves and foreigners who would not have been their patients)， several nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas might have been pres-ent at any given time if the epidemiology of pituitary disease were similar to the present day， and， as there was no effective treatment， that number， because of case accumulation， may have been even higher. The prevalence of pituitary apoplexy in a defined population in southern England was about 6 cas-es per 100 000 population， or somewhat less than 1 patient per year at any given time in the proposed city-state . If classical pituitary apoplexy and hypothyroidism are both to be included， the situation is even more uncommon. On the other hand， if mild forms of pituitary apoplexy are included， such cases would be more common， although it is uncertain as to what degree . Assuming a standardized incidence ra-tio approaching 2 patients with pituitary apoplexy per 100 000population per year， of whom half become hypothyroid， this would equate to a case of hypothyroidism following pituitary apoplexy every 10 years. Given this statistical background， if a small group of medical professionals， perhaps 4 or 5 practi-tioners， periodically pooled their knowledge and experience over a generation， the assertions of Chapter 12 of Diseases l could claim epidemiological plausibility. Furthermore， it has been proposed that Hippocratic physicians could communicate with one another even though geographically dispersed .\n\n【26】Conclusions\n\n【27】While of clinical interest in itself， the 2 remarkable features of the physician's report are 1) the association of clinical evidence of pituitary apoplexy and subsequent myxedema as manifesta-tions of a single underlying disease process despite many years between the 2 events， and 2) the ability of early Hippocratic clinicians to maintain a written or oral record of one or per-haps several patients'clinical history over those years that al-lowed them to make such an audacious assumption， one that would not be confirmed for 2400 years .\n\n【28】. The authors report an annual incidence rate of 3/100，000 in U.S.， an average value that covers all age and ethnic group5.\n\n【29】Appendix\n\n【30】The Greek version of Diseases II， chapter 12， a treatise attributed. to Hippocrates， is extracted from the 1538 Froben edition of the works of Hippocrates， as edited by the famed scholar and friend of Erasmus， Janus Cornarius . Chapter 12 is divided into five paragraphs in the Loeb Classical Library edition of Hippocrates (Harvard University Press)， volume 5， as edited by Dr. Paul Potter， and is presented in English vernacular in the Case Discussion section of the attached article. The first two paragraphs in Greek with the author’s interlinear literal translation are given below. It was felt important that a degree of literal translation be retained， for accuracy is preferred to literary merit that might come with a more readable translation. Words that differ between the 1538 edition and the modern Loeb Classical Library edition of Hippocrates are bolded. All five paragraphs， with some deletions considered irrelevant， are presented only in the vernacular translation in the attached article.\n\n【31】voucol ai drto tn xEpahijg Yivop.eval. ocav narpns diseases the from the head to be developing； whenever full Yevy汇atnxeppaln， xat ruxy ino rivog it becomes the head， and it happens from something tourov 8tcBepuav8evot，voprn loyelof them to be thoroughly heated， numbness (hypesthesia) grips cry xepakry， nal oupest auyva. nat co &aaa no-the head， and he urinates very much. and the other \\[symptoms\\]he ayet &iep ino atpoyyouping. 6 curos fpepug evvex is affected as if from strangury. the same days nine toora ndoyet， ual in pey payi xuta toc pivac， these he suffers. and should it flow down from the nose， xata to arts ibwp xat pAcivva， dnoXAoouETalor down from the ears water or dribble.he is relieved\n\n【32】Adams W.H.：\n\n【33】rre vouaou， nat rtodecar trjc atpayyoupirg. oupeel of the disease， and he has suppression of the strangury； he urinates tè dróvog. xol noulu xoi Aeuxov， es rig elxootv 丫pe-and easily. both much and pale. within twenty pag. xol iex trg xecpunijs oouvy exheinet， xoi ex days. and from the headthe tenderness remits， and from Thv oq9ukuov eaopbvtt xhenreroi ol iadyr.\n\n【34】the eyes looking into is concealed which the bright gleam \\[of the eyes\\].\n\n【35】noi ǒoxeei to fpou cov moooonwy 6pav.ourog andhe seems unilateral \\[one side\\] of faceDsSto be discerning. this \\[patient\\] Teaospaxoovalog uyeng nav tehog YiveTaL.\n\n【36】by forty days healthycompletelyybecomes.\n\n【37】evlors 8e nou入ols inoveotpedev r vouooc EB8op.o\n\n【38】sometimes and in many gradually comes back the disease in sevenitei，i teaospeouatBexdrar xal vò 8epuu oi noy-vears or fourteen. and the skin is thickened\n\n【39】veTal to rie xeoalijg. nat bauouevov uneixee xoi\n\n【40】of the head. and being toucheddindents： and\n\n【41】oen’ oiyuv atriwv， dnahoc nal siypoog paivero，\n\n【42】from a little food soft aanndd a good complexion it (the skin) appears， not axoiet oux 8560.\n\n【43】and the patient hears not acutely.\n\n【44】Hippocratic works come down to us after passing through many hands， some having been transcribed by illiterate scribes， others have been translated by scholars of other cultures such as Arabic that often had no equivalent words for Greek medical terminology. It is not a surprise， therefore， that part of the first paragraph above is duplicated by transcription error in chapter ⅤIII of another Hippocratic work， Regimen in Health， for which see the Loeb Classical Library volume4 of the series， Hippocrates， as edited by Dr. W. H S. Jones and published in 1967， p. 57. Thatsame paragraph as found in the 1538 edition of the works of Hippocrates is presented below， again with difference in wording between it and the Loeb Classical Library version being bolded：oxóootot iě youoou dno còv eyxecpaloy yivovtal， voprr npdrov loyet thy xeparijvs xat oupist Savo， xal e’diAa ndoyet oxood enl atpayroupir. oucog ep huepdc evea ourog mhoyel. nai ty pev payi xard roc piva i xuco co ara loop， phevya，onodaoeral tie yooou， nal rrjc atpayyouping nobetal. oupist ie nou， nal drovog， nol AeUxov. ěc’Bv sixoaly uepac napenn xai ex tie xsoalie no8uim exheinsl to dv8p6no， eaopeovu： 8e penecal oi iauyh.\n\n【45】)Note that， in this duplicate transcription， eyxepahov is used instead of xepuNoc， which changes the meaning from “head\"to ‘brain.\"This transcription， ifit is closer to the correct version， implies that the writer of Diseases II， 12， considered the source of the problem being described as originating in the brain. This would fit better the present clinical interpretation.\n\n【46】 The additional word nparov (“first\") is consistent with the early onset of hypesthesia of the face， and it suggests that the section orov. 8tBepuavv8evo. in the 1538 version (and bolded in the first Greek paragraph above) is miscopied into that work， for that section implies the problem originated in the sinuses or middle ear when they became “full.\" Dr. Paul Potter， in his translation of Diseases Il， 12， omits oray. 8tcepuov Jevat， as does this duplicate transcription. This also strengthens the argument that the duplicate transcription is closer to the original.\n\n【47】 But even if it is not the more accurate version， 8toBapuovHevot definitely does not mean“fever.” It means， instead， “to be heated throughout\"， and is an attempt at explaining the pathophysiology underlying the liquidity of the noxious agent(s) causing the illness.\n\n【48】 Another linguistic difference is the use ofauvo rather than ouyvo. The former is translatable as“crowded”or“frequent，”whereas the latter can mean， in addition， “very much，\"thus permitting a translation more consistent with both increased frequency and increased volume ofurine output. A sole increase in volume of urine is not consistent with the definition of strangury， for the definition of the ancient Greek term for “strangury”is similar to its modern one. This may explain why the term is here distinguished apart from the usual (“other\") symptoms of strangury\n\n【49】 BRcivva. (Bevva， rhewva.) is translated here as consistent with its use by a contemporary writer， Sophron of Syracuse， for dribble implies a more aqueous liquid rather than the usual translation (“slime’) that might imply the more viscous mucus.\n\n【50】 In the final line， oe (“but\") rather than xol (“and\") suggests the patient has not become completely healthy at twenty days despite clearing of some symptoms. This is also indicated in the text of Diseases II， chapter 12\n\n【51】 The word eoopeovet Eoopovr in the text of Diseases II， chapter 12) is translated as “looking into，\"forelo (eo) has its root meaning \"in” or\"into，\"and most words having sta (eo) as a prefix specify an action in or into. The corneal light reflex is tested not by looking through the pupil into the globe of the eye， but by merely holding a light source before the patient and noting if the reflected glint of the light visible in the pupil is normally positioned in each eye. In this sense the translation comes closer to its usual translation as “peering closely.”\n\n【52】 In contrast to the first Greek paragraph above， BeneTol (BAdTEtol in the Loeb Classical Library series of Hippocrates) rather than xenretoi suggests the comneal glint was not hidden but was defective or abnormal. On the other hand， if there were sufficient exotropia of one eye， the corneal light reflex might truly have seemed to be absent in one eye. Such are the vagaries of attempts at accurate translations.\n\n【53】1\\. Littre E： Oeuvres completes d'Hippocrate. 10 volumes， Paris： Bailliere et\n\n【54】Fils；\n\n【55】2\\. Adams F.

Approximately 60% of COPD patients between 18-64 years does not have a connection to the workforce， and the COPD patients in the workforce have more time off work due to illness. The current literature review aimed to examine COPD patients' return to work after exacerbation of COPD and predisposing factors in the population for detachment or delayed return to work. Methods： The literature search was conducted in the databases Pubmed， Embase， CINAHL， and the Cochrane Library. Search terms regarding COPD and \"return to work\"was used. Results： Only one article describing COPD patients'return to work after acute exacerbation of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Conclusion： There is a need for more studies investigating COPD patients’ return to work after exacerbations， as well as an exploration of modifiable aspects in COPD patients' connection to the workforce.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Pulmonary Disease， Chronic Obstructive， Return to work， Employment， Absenteeism， Retirement， Sick leave\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】The World Health Organization estimates that 65 million people worldwide suffer from moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) which resulted in 3.0 million deaths globally in 2016， and thereby the third leading cause of death in the world . An exacerbation of COPD is defined as an acute worsening of respiratory symptoms that lead to additional therapy . The exacerbation usually persists for 7-10 days and contributes to a progression in disease severity .\n\n【4】Approximately 40% of COPD patients between 18-64 years are employed compared to 80% of the entire Danish popula-tion . Somewhat similar results were found in the Burden of Obstructive Lung Disease-study， which found that 36.7% of participants (age 40-64) reported paid jobs within the last year， whereas 52.6% of the population without airway obstructionreported paid work . Furthermore， patients with COPD have high sick leave frequencies of approximately 8.5 days off work per person per year due to disease . As such， the poor connec-tion to the workforce affect productivity. Estimates of patients'costs in loss of productivity per person per year differs between countries， ranging from 566-9815 USD .\n\n【5】In a previous study by Peters et al. from 2007， return to work， and job loss were examined for respiratory illness. At that time only five articles were included， where only one described return to work for COPD patients . Due to the sparse literature， the review concluded a need for more prospective cohort studies. Given the substantial socioeconomic consequences of COPD not least due to patients’ sparse connection to the workforce， and increased scientific interest in the area since 2007 would be expected. The aim of this review was therefore to investigate the literature that has emerged on COPD patients return to work after exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\n【6】Methods\n\n【7】Data sources\n\n【8】The literature search was performed on January 29， 2019， with6045 results. The Pubmed， Embase， CINAHL and Cochrane Library yielded 1389，4076， 340 and 240 results respectively. Thesearch was conducted on MeSH terms， title， abstract and key word (text word) as following： (\"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\"， COPD，“chronic obstructive lung disease\"，“chronic obstructive airway disease\"， “chronic bronchitis\") and (“Return to work\"， “job re-entry\"，\"employment\"，“employed\"，“absen-teeism\"，“retirement\"，“occupational health\"，“medical leave\"，“sick leave\".\n\n【9】Study selection\n\n【10】Articles containing information on patients return to work after AECOPD were included， and examined for predisposing factors of poor outcomes. Reference manager Endnote X9 was used for reference handling， and after a duplicate search 5015 articles remained. Paper headlines and abstracts were examined and excluded if they did not contain relevant information on return to work. Conference abstracts were excluded due to insufficient data to perform the review. Papers on work-related exposure with pulmonary toxicity were excluded due to a possible bias of work-related exposure. Articles in other languages than English and Danish were excluded. A primary reviewer was responsi-ble for the primary examination and after the initial sorting 27articles remained. The remaining articles were independently examined by a primary and a secondary reviewer for relevant information on return to work and prognostic factors affecting return to work. In case of disagreement between the reviewers， a third reviewer had the final vote on which articles to include. Af-ter reviewing the articles by both reviewers， one relevant article remained and was included in the review.\n\n【11】Data extraction\n\n【12】Data extraction and analysis were not performed because only one article described return to work as an outcome. The results of this study are presented as it was in the original article.\n\n【13】Results\n\n【14】Only one article was identified with a description of characteris-tics' affecting COPD patients' return to work， explained in table1. The article， by Alexopoulos et al.， examined among other things return to work after absence from work with respiratory symptoms categorized into asthma， COPD and chronic non-specific lung symptoms . Employees， consisting of 251 male employees from two different companies involved in building large constructions， was examined by comparing office clerks， welders and metal workers. The study found that 67% returned to work within five workdays， 90% returned to work within ten workdays， and only 2% had absence that exceeded 20 days. The only significant prognostic return to work association was a delayed return for metalworkers and welders compared with office clerks in patients with COPD symptoms.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】This review aimed to identify studies describing COPD patients'return to work. Only one study was found describing the aim of the review.\n\n【17】The review from 2007 by Peters et al. was conducted on return to work or job loss in patients with respiratory symp-toms and included the article by Alexopoulos et al. J. They conclude that there was a lack of evidence of delayed return to work and that the measure of return to work might not be the best measure for bad respiratory health. The authors argue that since workers with sick leave due to respiratory ill-healthmight have shorter sick leave periods， a measure of duration and frequency might be more appropriate. The shorter sick leave in COPD patients falls in line with the median duration of symptoms of an exacerbation in moderate to severe COPD is approximately seven days (IQR 4-14) and may， therefore， be the reason why no further research on return to work in COPD patients has emerged since 2007. However， some patients have a prolonged recovery from exacerbation with 7.1% not recover-ing pre-exacerbation peak expiratory flow rate after 91 days . These patients may also have prolonged return to work， and if it is possible to identify these patients earlier， preventive measures may be set in place.\n\n【18】In a systematic review from 2018， by Rai et al.， COPD's ef-fect on work-related outcomes were examined . This review found that COPD patients had lower employment rates com-pared to patients without COPD， was less likely to return to the workforce after leaving the workforce compared to patients without chronic conditions， had higher early retirement rates compared to patients without COPD， and took more time off work than those without COPD . Different studies in the re-view found statistical significant longer periods of absenteeism in patients who reported greater symptoms， greater perceived disease severity and a tendency towards longer periods of absen-teeism in patients with breathlessness . However， the review concludes that there is a need for research examining modifi-able characteristics of COPD patients to be able to implement interventions aimed at improving the workforce connection .\n\n【19】Interestingly， no new papers on return to work have been published in the last 12 years. Other measures of work attach-ment have been researched such as presentism， absenteeism and early retirement. COPD patients have within these fields a poorer connection to the workforce compared to healthy adults and other chronic diseases . Some characteristics have been associated with worse outcomes， e.g. increased airflow obstruc-tion， COPD symptoms and infections . The relationship with AECOPD and return to work， however， remains unanswered. Questions that might be answered by researching this subject are； does the AECOPD initiates the detachment from the work-.\n\n| Author：  | Outcome：  | Population： n=251  | RR delayedreturn to work：  | (95%CI)  | P-value：  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Author：Alexopoulos E.

It might be that the Peters et al. review is right in the observation that patients in general who suffer sick leave due to respiratory ill health have shorter periods of sick leave . This is， however， more an assumption than a conclusion and not sufficiently established in the litera-ture. It is therefore paramount to examine return to work for the COPD population due to the known poor connection to the workforce.\n\n【22】The question of a return to work has however been examined in other chronic diseases entities such as musculoskeletal-and mental health disorders， traumatic and acquired brain injury cardiovascular conditions， cancer， stroke and multiple sclerosis. There are shared prognostic factors between the different conditions. Positive factors affecting return to work include higher education and socioeconomic status， lower severity of the injury/illness and employment before injury . Negative factors affecting return to work include older age， female sex， higher pain or disability， depression， previous sick leave， ac-tivity limitations/participation restriction， and higher physical work demands . Interventions with favourable outcomes regarding return to work within the different conditions include multidisciplinary， occupational care/training， education， psy-chological， and outpatient interventions/comprehensive treat-ment . One study regarding return to work concerning oc-cupational respiratory illness that included a wide variety of diagnoses found that being a union member， early referral to the occupational clinic and a lower number of comorbid condi-tions had a more favourable return to work . They however counterintuitively found that smokers have a more favourable return to work than non-smokers do. With the knowledge that approximately 60% of COPD patients are outside the workforce and smoking is the primary cause of COPD， it seems to be un-likely that smoking would have beneficial effects on return to work in a COPD population. These prognostic factors may also apply to COPD patients return to work， and it is essential to confirm this together with identifying prognostic factors specific for COPD (e.g. spirometry， symptom score， smoking status). The identification of vulnerable patients and modifiable factors in COPD patients will assist in the development of rehabilitation programs for COPD to retain their connection to the workforce. The current literature review has limitations. Only one re-viewer conducted the primary literature search. Only articles in Danish or English were included which may have excluded relevant articles. The choice of excluding articles regarding pulmonary toxic substances might also have excluded some information on return to work for COPD patients， which may skew the result. However， the inclusion of these studies wouldlimit the generalizability of the results. The study by Alexopou-los et al. has its limitations. A very small population of four office workers who reported COPD symptoms in connection with absence from work served as a control group for return to work in metalworkers and welders. It is， therefore， possible that there are statistical uncertainties in the study. Besides， the study population of metalworkers and welders may have been exposed to pulmonary toxic substances that may have biased the findings of the study.\n\n【23】In conclusion， only one article found on COPD patients re-turn to work. We must conclude that the literature on the subject is very sparse. No new studies have been published the past12 years. This review therefore calls for studies investigating， for one， COPD patients' return to work after absence due to health problems， secondly， disease-specific prognostic factors that may be modifiable to improve the COPD population connec-tion to the workforce and lastly， early interventions to prevent absenteeism in COPD patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Since the first reported case of plas-macytoid urothelial carcinoma (PUC)， in 1991， only about 100 cases have since been reported， with most cas-es involving the bladder. Urothelial carcinomas of the upper urinary tract represent only 5% of urothelial can-cers. To the best of our knowledge， there has only been 1 reported case of PUC of the ureter. PUC is a highly aggressive disease， with a poor prognosis. We present a rare biopsy-proven case of PUC of the ureter with ret-roperitoneal metastasis.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 60-year-old man came into the hospital with complaints of a 5-day history of generalized abdominal pain， nausea， and vomiting. with no associated urinary symptoms prior to admission. CT demonstrated small bowel obstruction (SBO) and obstructive uropathy due to a right ureteric mass. Exploratory laparotomy small bowel resection， gastrostomy tube placement， and umbilical hernia repair were all done. Histology and immunohis-tochemistry were compatible with plasmacytoid variant of urothelial cancer. He underwent a cystouretosco-py and a right ureteral stent placement with a right ureteroscopy Final CT abdomen/pelvis revealed recurrent SBO before the ileocecal valve， possibly due to carcinomatosis. lleocecal resection with end ileostomy place-ment was done. Systemic treatment will begin as an outpatient.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】PUC arising from the ureter is rare， and retroperitoneal metastatic disease has not been reported previously. Here， we compare the clinical manifestations of the more common PUC of the bladder with our case. From this we are able to learn more about the disease and its presentation.\n\n【6】MeSH Keywords：\n\n【7】Plasmacytoma· Retroperitoneal Neoplasms· Ureteral Neoplasms ·Ureteral Obstruction·Urinary Bladder NeoplasmsUrothelial carcinomas of the upper urinary tract are relative-ly uncommon， representing only 5% of urothelial cancers. Plasmacytoid urothelial carcinoma (PUC) is an extremely rare variant of this epithelial tumor， which has proven to be highly aggressive. According to a recent study， since the first report in 1991 by Sahin et al.， there have been less than 100 cases of PUC reported in the literature . In addition， it was not until2004 that the WHO recognized this histological variant under the classification of urothelial neoplasms. Nearly all plasmacy-toid UC occur in the bladder； however， in 2013 the first case of PUC in the ureter was reported . PUC is a highly aggressive disease， with a poor prognosis. We present a rare biopsy-prov-en case of PUC of the ureter with retroperitoneal metastasis.\n\n【8】The first reported case of PUC by Sahin et al. was character-ized by lytic tumors involving the ribs and skull， which was mistaken for multiple myeloma . The plasmacytoid patho-logical appearance was originally thought to be diagnostic of B cell lymphoma and plasmacytoma， which is why there have been many misdiagnoses. However， it is now known that the cells of non-B cell hematopoietic neoplasm and various non-hematopoietic neoplasm derivatives can also have a plasma-cytoid appearance . In 2006， two noninvasive bladder tu-mors resembling plasmacytoma were reported by Coyne and Sim . The importance of obtaining immunohistochemistry in the differential diagnosis of neoplasm etiology in order to differentiate these tumors is emphasized.\n\n【9】Hematuria is a typical presenting characteristic of urological can-cers. As a result， the major diagnostic pitfall is the deficiency of specific clinical features to differentiate PUC from other types of bladder cancers. PUC is often diagnosed late because of the ab-sence of hematuria and lack of an identifiable tumor in the blad-der， which is an unusual characteristic compared to conventional bladder cancers . When PUC is identified， it is usually a high-grade aggressive tumor， often with advanced stage that results in worse outcomes than with conventional urothelial carcinomas.\n\n【10】Here， we report a rare case of PUC of the ureter， which present-ed as a small bowel obstruction as a result of a periduodenal mass extending from the ureter， with resultant hydronephro-sis and SBO at the ileum. With no genitourinary symptoms or signs， it was surprising to find this rare variant of UC. We will explore the clinical and pathological differences we found in our case compared with other known cases of PUC.\n\n【11】Case Report\n\n【12】A 60-year-old white man was admitted with complaints of a5-day history of sharp epigastric abdominal pain， with nauseaand vomiting. The patient had been unable to pass stool or fla-tus for 1 week. There was absence of other symptoms such as gross hematuria， urgency， or frequency prior to admission. His abdomen was tender and distended. His past medical history was significant for EtOH abuse， uncontrolled hypertension， and a 44-pack-year history of smoking. He denied any personal or family history of cancer. Urine sent for urine analysis revealed microscopic hematuria. CA 19-9 was>5000， which is concerning for pancreaticobiliary origin. Computerized tomography (CT) dem-onstrated a right ureteric mass in continuity with a high-grade distal small bowel obstruction with transition points at the level of the proximal ileum and distal small and large bowel collapse， right obstructive uropathy and hydronephrosis， and bilateral dense renal lesions (suspicious for hemorrhagic cysts) .\n\n【13】A CT chest was done to evaluate for metastasis and there were no acute abnormalities or lymphadenopathy seen. The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy， small bowel resection(SBR)， gastrostomy tube placement， and umbilical hernia re-pair. Surgical pathology of the SBR revealed a poorly differen-tiated carcinoma with extensive lymphovascular invasion aris-ing from the serosal surface with extensive involvement of the muscularis propria and submucosa. Mucosa demonstrated re-active changes. The biopsy revealed metastatic poorly differ-entiated carcinoma， most consistent with plasmacytoid vari-ant urothelial carcinoma . The pathological staging of the UC was tumor stage 4 TXNXM1. Immunohistochemical profiles of the tumor cells were strongly diffusely positive for CK20 and CK7， positive for Gata-3 and AE1/3， but negative for TTF1， S100， and CDX2. Immunostains for CK20 and CK7 per-formed on lymph node sections demonstrated 1 of 2 lymph nodes with metastatic carcinoma. Extensive lymphvascularin-vasion was noted on surgical pathology.\n\n【14】On post-op SBR day 4， the patient underwent a bilateral retro-grade pyelogram， right uteroscopy， and a cystoscopy. Cystoscopy revealed a heavily trabeculated bladder with several diverticula but no evidence of stones or tumors. With a right pyelogram the ureter was noted to be quite tortuous and extremely stenotic from the mid-ureter up toward the renal pelvis and collecting system. This is where the stent was placed. The upper pole of the left ureter showed distortion with apparent mass affect but no tumor in the urinary collecting system itself. Umbilical hernia pathology reports show fibrovascular adipose tissue， consistent with a hernia， and no evidence of malignant tissue.\n\n【15】On post-op SBR day 10， a repeat abdominal/pelvis CT showed a recurrent SBO area before the ileocecal valve， possibly due to adhesion or carcinomatosis. We also saw a stable known tumor in the second and third portions of the duodenum， with metas-tasis in the right retroperitoneum obstructing the right ureter. The patient underwent a second exploratory laparotomy，includ-ing an ileocecal resection and end ileostomy bag application.\n\n【16】While an inpatient， our patient was medically managed for hy-pertension， hyponatremia， agitation， dietary supplementation， and pain control. The list of related medication are as follows：clonidine patch 0.2 mg， metoprolol 5 mg l q6h， sodium chloride1 gm tab PO BID， Ativan 0.5 mg lV push q8， Morphine 1 mg/ml PCA interval 8 min 4 h limit dose 30 mg Ⅳ， Robaxin 1000 mg PO q6 PRN， and hyperalimentation-ADULT 2160 mL lV over 24 h.\n\n【17】Although palliative care treatment is suggested due to the ad-vanced disease in this patient， he has chosen to undergo che-motherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy was not started immediate-ly； he will be visiting an oncologist as an outpatient after being discharged. A cisplatin-based therapy will be initiated during this time. While the patient will be a candidate for chemotherapy fol-lowed by radiation or surgery， this disease is likely to be very ag-gressive. There is also high concern regarding compliance with fur-ther appointments due to social issues. These issues will be further explored and discussed with the patient prior to start of therapy.\n\n【18】Plasmacytoid urothelial carcinoma is an extremely rare variant of UC. The histological feature for the tumor tissue is predom-inately manifested by characteristic plasmacytoid tumor cell morphology. This variant is a high-grade UC， which is usually diagnosed in the advanced pathological stage. The aggressive behavior of the PUC's is further emphasized in previous pub-lished case reports of survival rate， which shows the tenden-cy toward a shorter overall survival of the patients with PUC compared to those with conventional invasive UC of the blad-der. However， the majority of the series in the literature are small， with the largest ones having 32 patients .\n\n【19】In our case， the patient has a poorly differentiated urothelial carcinoma plasmacytoid type of the ureter with retroperitone-al metastasis and small bowel obstruction. In a 2012 review by Ricardo-Gonzales & Nguyen et al.， PUC had a predilection for intraperitoneal spread， which is unusual when compared to conventional UC of the bladder， presenting with discontin-uous involvement of serosal surfaces . However， our case did not demonstrate this； rather， we saw retroperitoneal me-tastasis with continuous spread.\n\n【20】Several authors have reported the lack of E-cadherin expres-sion in most plasmacytoid tumors， which is a necessary pro-tein for cell-to-cell adhesion. This provides support of the his-tological findings of loss of cellular differentiation， increased cellular invasiveness， and the overall discohesive growth of the tumor， which was also seen in our case.\n\n【21】Clinically， PUC is characterized by advanced stage at diagnosis and poor prognosis. The most common presenting symptom is hematuria， which can be associated with urgency， frequen-cy， or lower abdominal pain. However， diagnosis is often de-layed due to the absence of hematuria until late stage of the disease. In fact， there have been reported cases in which PUC was diagnosed late due to the lack of hematuria and absence of an identifiable tumor in the bladder. In cases like this， cys-toscopy findings are usually thickened bladder wall andindu-rated mucosa . The mean age of initial diagnosis is in the60's， and there is a male predominance (8：1). In our case， there were no presenting symptoms to indicate urogenital con-cerns until a urine analysis showed microscopic hematuria.\n\n【22】Clinical management for PUC is not well-defined due to the rarity of the disease and the late presentation. Since most pa-tients presenting with this disease have advanced stage at di-agnosis， treatment in the past primarily consisted of both deep transurethral resection of tumor and partial or radical cystec-tomy. To date， radical cystectomy is considered the best ini-tial choice for invasive or noninvasive PUC， followed by ad-juvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy and radiation/surgery，with a median survival of 27.4 months . Management of patients with metastatic disease generally includes system-ic therapy due to the poor prognostic factors. Systemic treat-ment with gemcitabine and cisplatin will be the therapy of choice for our patient. An aggressive approach is recommend-ed given the high invasive potential of PUC Compared to con-ventional UC， PUC patients have a significantly worse overall survival rate； thus， more studies that include a larger number of patients are necessary to define the best treatment strat-egies for these patients.\n\n【23】Our patient will follow up as an outpatient with urology/oncol-ogy for right ureteral stent removal， as well as to further dis-cuss treatment options. No tumor was identified in the bladder； therefore， a cystectomy was not done as an inpatient. However， we question whether a nephrouterectomy with bladder cuff excision can be done as a definitive treatment option， as was done in the first case of ureteral PUC . The treatment in the study resulted in a known 12-month survival period after di-agnosis， without evidence of reoccurrence on follow-up. If af-ter chemotherapy is completed there are no detectable mass-es， it will be interesting to follow this patient and see if there is any reoccurrence of PUC without a complete tumor resec-tion. There is a strong predilection for reoccurrence along the peritoneal lining， and in some reported cases there is an ini-tial surge in the serum CA-125 levels. This surge precedes ra-diological and symptomatic findings of progression . Thus， follow-up for this patient can include measurements of serum CA-125， which may help recognize early disease progression and aid in initiating second-line therapies before the patient becomes symptomatic.\n\n【24】Conclusions\n\n【25】PUC continues to remain a rare variant of UC after the first dis-covery in 1991. The plasmacytoid variant proves to differ from conventional bladder cancers in a number of ways， including clinical presentation and course of metastasis. This brings up the question as to why we are treating it using the same con-ventional methods， when responses to treatments are only for a short duration of time before tumor recurrence. There is very little known about PUC and the course of this disease and best treatment management， and our case helps provide further insight into how this malignancy can present clinical-ly and pathologically. Further studies based on early and late diagnoses of this tumor entity， with larger cohorts， are need-ed to develop new and effective identification and therapeu-tic strategies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "9bd48d8f-f3bf-4518-9715-8412b61ba70f", "title": null, "text": "【0】Background： Metal hypersensitivity is an uncommon complication after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) that can lead to sig-nificant functional impairment and aseptic prosthesis failure.\n\n【1】Case Report： We describe a 70-year-old patient who presented with persistent pain， swelling. and instability 2 years after a primary TKA. The patient had a history of metal hypersensitivity following bilateral metal-on-metal total hip arthroplasty (THA) that was revised to ceramic-on-polyethylene implants. Knee radiographs showed severe os-teolysis with implant loosening. Serum cobalt was elevated and serum chromium was significantly elevated， while joint aspiration and inflammatory marker levels ruled out a periprosthetic infection. Revision TKA was performed， with intraoperative tissue pathology and postoperative leukocyte transformation testing confirm-ing metal hypersensitivity as the cause for aseptic implant failure.\n\n【2】Conclusions：\n\n【3】This case report demonstrates the clinical and laboratory signs that suggest metal hypersensitivity in total knee arthroplasty and the potential for joint function restoration with revision surgery\n\n【4】MeSH Keywords： Arthroplasty， Replacement， Knee · Metal-on-Metal Joint Prostheses · ReoperationTotal knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a effective treatment option in patients with debilitating pain and limited knee function from joint arthritis . However， the procedure can result in perioperative complications，which most commonly include in-fection， instability， and implant failure， that often require revi-sion arthroplasty to restore patient function and mobility . Metal hypersensitivity， or an allergic reaction to metal ions， is another potential complication of knee arthroplasty. It oc-curs rarely and unpredictably， but can cause significant joint dysfunction and implant failure . Hypersensitivity can be distinguished from infection based on joint aspiration analy-sis and inflammatory marker levels； however it is otherwise a diagnosis of exclusion due to the lack of a sensitive confirma-tory test as well as unique clinical symptoms .\n\n【5】In this report we present a patient with a history of failed bi-lateral Metal-on-Metal (MoM) bearing total hip arthroplasty(THA) due to hypersensitivity who went on to develop a similar reaction after her subsequent TKA. The aim of this work is to draw attention to diagnostic techniques and surgical principles to treat TKA aseptic failure induced by metal hypersensitivity.\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】A 70-year-old woman presenting with osteoarthritis and me-dial joint space loss  underwent left TKA at an out-side institution. The primary surgeon used a posterior-stabi-lized implant with cobalt-chromium components (Attune Knee\n\n【8】System，Depuy Synthes， Warsaw， indiana) . There were\n\n【9】no significant complications during the perioperative period. Subsequently the patient reported new onset pain， swelling，and joint instability of her left knee. The pain started several months after the surgery， was associated with standing from a seated position and prolonged weight-bearing. Physical ther-apy， assistive ambulatory devices， anti-inflammatory medi-cations， and pain management evaluation were all utilized； however， the symptoms persisted. Periprosthetic fracture and joint infection were ruled out， with records reporting normal CRP and ESR levels with a joint aspiration resulting in a leu-kocyte count of 1650 cells/ml， 85% macrophages， and a low polymorphonucleocyte percentage. The recommendation was made for revision TKA surgery due to aseptic failure， implant loosening and instability. Of note， the patient previously had bilateral metal-on-metal bearing THA done by an outside sur-geon three years prior that were revised to ceramic heads and polyethylene acetabular liners； although there were no formal laboratory studies performed by this surgeon， the presump-tive diagnosis was metal hypersensitivity. Her femoral stems and acetabular cups were retained.\n\n【10】On initial examination at our clinic， 14 months after the index TKA procedure， the surgical incision over the knee was well healed without significant swelling， erythema， drainage， or oth-er evidence of infection. The patient exhibited tenderness at the medial and lateral joint lines and had a limited and pain-ful passive range of motion between 10 and 110 degrees. Mild to moderate effusion was present. She had full strength with active knee flexion and extension. There was moderate varus and valgus laxity on extension， mid flexion， and full flexion. The patient was neurovascular intact and had full strength in all distributions distally. Imaging showed significant osteoly-sis， loss of tibial posterior slope， and settling of the tibial base-plate into varus as compared to her previous images taken af-ter surgery .\n\n【11】The patient elected to pursue revision TKA. Because of her his-tory of sensitivity to cobalt and chromium after her metal on metal bearing THAs as well as her current TKA failure， the deci-sion was made to use an oxidized zirconium femoral componentand a titanium based tibial baseplate (Legion Oxinium， Smith\n\n【12】& Nephew， Memphis， Tennessee) in the revision surgery. The\n\n【13】procedure was undertaken 17 months after the primary TKA.\n\n【14】An incision was made through the previous scar， and a medi-al parapatellar approach was used to enter the joint. Upon ar-throtomy through the previous incision， aggressive and hyper-trophic fibrous synovitis was immediately identified around the joint . The synovial fluid appeared hazy and yel-low. A complete synovectomy was performed and samples sent for histology analysis. Intraoperative joint fluid analy-sis resulted in 10% polymorphonucleocytes， 9% lymphocyte，81% macrophage， and a leukocyte cell count of 533 cells/ml， with a very low likelihood of infection as the cause of failure. The tibial liner showed signs of mild wear. The femoral com-ponent was removed revealing severe bone loss and erosion，especially at the anterior femur and posterior femoral con-dyles， which were nearly completely resorbed. The lateral fem-oral epicondyle had a stress fracture line， most likely due to the weakened and resorbed bone leading to valgus collapse； this was seen after implant removal and was reduced and se-cured using a locking plate. The tibial component was com-pletely loose and removed by hand， revealing again severe bone erosion and cyst formation. After the femur and tibia had been debrided to yield adequate bone stock， the revision TKA procedure was then completed using a varus-valgus con-strained implant (Legion Total Knee System， Smith & Nephew，\n\n【15】Memphis， Tennessee). Augments were utilized to reconstitute\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】the anatomical joint line， achieve equal flexion and extension gaps， and ensure overall knee stability .\n\n【18】The synovium， which was sent to pathology， was found to have granulation tissue， fibrosis， and focal giant cell reaction and calcification . IgE and eosinophil levels were both high， indicating a systemic allergic response. The patient’s se-rum was sent for analysis (Associated Regional and University\n\n【19】Pathologists， Salt Lake City， Utah) with results showing elevat-ed levels of serum cobalt at 2.4 ug/L (0.08-0.5 ug/L reference) and serum chromium at>1000 ug/L (0.06-0.93 ug/L reference).\n\n【20】Leukocyte sensitivity tests (Orthopedic Analysis， Chicago， Illinois)\n\n【21】showed increased reactivity (0-2 stimulation index reference) to aluminum (2.5)， vanadium (3.8)， molybdenum (3.1)， and nick-el (3.6)， but not to cobalt (0.9) or chromium (1.1).\n\n【22】The patient had no post-operative complications and was al-lowed to be 25% weight bearing with an unlocked hinge knee brace. She was discharged on the second postoperative day. By the first clinic visit at 2 weeks， the patient was ambulating significantly with physical therapy and had a pain-free active range of motion from 10-100 degrees. The incision was fully healed and there was no evidence of infection. Radiographs showed a well-aligned joint without evidence of acute implant failure. At the 6 week visit， the patient had been weaned from her brace and had full weight bearing capacity with the use of a cane， mainly due to a history of back pain. She had a pain-free range of motion from 10-120 degrees. At the 4 month vis-it， the patient continued to do well， with a pain-free range of motion from 0-120 degrees and no evidence of joint effusion.\n\n【23】Metallic hypersensitivity is an uncommon and controversial cause of TKA failure. Although the exact cause of hypersensi-tivity is unknown， the release of metal ions from implant wear or corrosion with an immune response has been implicated . A Type lV delayed-hypersensitivity allergic reaction， with ac-tivation of CD4 and CD8 T-lymphocytes， results in release of cytokines such as interferon gamma， interleukin-1， interleu-kin-6， and tumor necrosis factor . This inflammatory cas-cade can ultimately cause bone resorption and implant failure.\n\n【24】Patients with metal hypersensitivity after TKA may present with multiple symptoms. Most commonly， the knee may be swol-len， stiff， and painful with clinical signs of localized eczema and dermatitis . Rarely， there can be a systemic response， with one recent case report detailing severe whole-body der-matitis and hair loss . In all cases， ruling out infection is of utmost importance. Inflammatory markers， such as ESR and CRP， should be measured， and if there is any doubt， a joint aspiration should be performed. Infection markers should be normal or only mildly elevated to support a diagnosis of met-al hypersensitivity .\n\n【25】The two most commonly used diagnostic tests include skin patch testing and lymphocyte transformation testing， which assess the reactivity of the immune system to common al-lergens. However， there are problems with both tests. The results of skin patch testing are subjective， may not reliably correlate to deep reactivity around orthopaedic implants，and may be influenced by sensitization from the test itself . Similarly， lymphocyte transformation testing does not always correlate with patch testing and is not readily available at most centers . As such， the results of these tests should becombined with other laboratory markers and clinical symp-toms to diagnose hypersensitivity.\n\n【26】There is no standard paradigm to approaching metal hyper-sensitivity after TKA， mainly because it is a diagnosis of ex-clusion. Over 10% of the general population has a history of cutaneous metal allergy， yet there seems to be insufficient evidence that this correlates to implant hypersensitivity . Multiple authors advocate preoperative testing for all pa-tients with cutaneous metal allergy but not routine screening for patients without this history . Granchi et al. provid-ed a flow chart to evaluate hypersensitivity， and recommend-ed patch testing for patients with a previous history of metal allergy followed by implantation of devices without metals if testing was positive . Similarly， Innocenti et al. used anal-lergic components in patients with suspected metal allergy with excellent midterm results .\n\n【27】Patients presenting with metal hypersensitivity after TKA will likely require revision surgery. An extensive synovectomy dur-ing revision surgery should be performed to decrease the met-al ion burden. Bone stock compromise may be present which will necessitate augmentation and intramedullary stems， and may require the use of constrained implants to ensure stability.\n\n【28】Anallergic components with oxidized zirconium， ceramic or ti-tanium coatings should be considered to limit dispersal of co-balt and chromium debris . Preoperative and intraop-erative joint analysis as well as postoperative histopathology testing should be performed to both rule out infection and con-firm the diagnosis of hypersensitivity. Pathology results may vary， with proliferation of histiocytes， giant cells， and synovi-al hyperplasia . Depending on the level of joint instability and weakness， limited weight-bearing with supportive devices may be required postoperatively until complete healing has oc-curred. Close follow-up is recommended for the first 3 months.\n\n【29】Conclusions\n\n【30】Metal hypersensitivity is an uncommon but potentially sig-nificant complication after TKA. Prior hypersensitivity to im-plants or metal warrants increased caution for future proce-dures. Frequent patient follow-up， as well as knowledge of the clinical and laboratory presentation of hypersensitivity， is necessary for diagnosis. Through early treatment with revision arthroplasty， patients presenting with symptomatic metal hy-persensitivity can have a stable and functional total knee ar-throplasty and a satisfactory outcome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Physicians must includegenomes， proteomics， immunohistochemistry， and imaging data in patient therapy recommendations， along with histological， clinical， and demographic data. Deep learning/Machine Learning and convolutional neural networks have been employed to build medical AI in recent years， which can reduce subjectivity and improve efficiency in treatment. Methods： This investigation makes use of a bibliometric strategy and knowledge mapping， using CiteSpace and R Biblioshiny to conduct a quantitative and visual analysis of the current picture of the development of AI in lung cancer. In this particular research endeavour， evaluations concerning authorship， nations， institutions， reference articles， keywords， and reference journals were carried out. Results： Through the review， a total of 1868 articles with contributions of a total of 9974 writers were analysed. Frontiers in Oncology journal is determined to be the most globally cited journal with83 articles and Jiying Wang and Yu wang has the highest h-Indexes， the top authors， are also the most influential ones. The most important keywords are \"radiomics\"，“convolutional neural network\" and \"feature selection\". The highest contributing country is held by China， which has an impressive 2103 publications； in second place is the USA with1858 publications. Conclusion： The Pulmonary nodule classification， Radiomics， circulating miRNAs biomarker， and Random Forest vector model are the top clusters and themes with good Q and silhouette values. Thus， we recommend that anyone interested in the field can start with these topics.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Bibliometric， Scientometric， Lung cancer， Biblioshiny， CiteSpace， Artificial Intelligence， Adenocarcinoma.\n\n【2】Since the beginning of the 20th century， lung cancer has con-sistently held the title of the most prevalent and burgeoning cancer diagnosis . According to estimates， there were 2.1million new cases of lung cancer diagnosed in 2018， which ac-counted for 12% of the total cancer burden worldwide . Lung cancer has high death rates and poor survival outcomes；how-ever， the next generation of targeted medicines and immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown stable long-term survival in subsets of patients. Consequently， these drugs may improve lung cancer patient outcomes， resulting in curable lung cancer in early-stage diagnosis and a controlled chronic condition in advanced or metastatic illness . Two primary histologic clas-sifications are used to classify lung cancer tumours： Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC).\n\n【3】The vast majority of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) may be classified into one of three primary categories： squamous cell carcinoma， adenocarcinoma， or large cell carcinoma， where 40%are adenocarcinomas， 25% to 30% are squamous cell carcinomas， and 10% to 15% are large cell carcinomas . When develop-ing personalised treatment plans for patients， in addition to histological， clinical， and demographic information， physicians need to integrate a wide range of data， including genomics， pro-teomics， immunohistochemistry， and imaging. This can be going to be difficult and lead to unfavourable outcomes. In addition， there are a number of obstacles that restrict access to these tests promptly. These issues include the high cost of the tests and their late availability inside the patient care continuum .\n\n【4】Artificial intelligence (AI) can replicate mental abilities in the analysis， interpretation， and understanding of sophisticated data and is being effectively utilised in various healthcare con-texts. This is made possible by the use of complex algorithms and software . Deep learning/Machine Learning (ML) and convolutional neural networks have been used in recent years to develop artificial intelligence (AI) for use in the medical field.\n\n【5】ML refers to the data analysis and interpretation carried out by computer programmes. These programmes can classify， forecast， and segment information to reveal insights that are not easily accessible to the human eye or mind. This is because \"deep learning\" algorithms have shown an increased ability to learn from their mistakes . Even though ML algorithms have been around for over twenty years， the current boom in the use of algorithms in medical services has shown substantial potential for their usage in increasing cancer treatment via the use of these algorithms . For example， when diagnosing lung cancer， combining AI algorithms with the clinical and biological data already available can enhance lung cancer screening procedures. The use of artificial intelligence in screening and detecting pulmonary nodules is an attractive area of study particularly in light of the growing number of lung cancer cases .\n\n【6】The use of bibliometric/scientometric analysis is becoming more popular in a variety of fields， including periodontology gynaecology， and neurology， to name a few examples . However， there has not been much bibliometric/Scientometric research conducted on lung cancer using AI. In light of the growing body of research published in this area between the years 1989 and 2022， a bibliometric/scientometric study was conducted in order to fully characterise the current picture of ad-vancement of artificial intelligence in lung cancer， highlight po-tential key topics through machine learning-based Latent Dirich-let allocation (LDA) model algorithms， and provide insightful information regarding the association between AI and lung can-cer and discover the potent themes .\n\n【7】Materials and Methods\n\n【8】The search process and data generation were performed from Scopus ， which the Elsevier BV Company developed in the United States.\n\n【9】More than 22，000 titles and high-impact scientific research from worldwide publishers are hosted on Scopus， which is the biggest database of scientific peer-review literature. Inclusion criteria and advanced query string for getting Bibtex and RIS files were as follows： TITLE-ABS-KEY ((“artificial intelligence\"AND“lung cancer\") OR (“artificial intelligence\" AND“ade-nocarcinoma\") OR (“machine learning\"AND“lung cancer\")) AND (LIMIT-TO (DOCTYPE， “ar\")) AND (LIMIT-TO (LAN-GUAGE，“English\")) AND (EXCLUDE ). The dataset consists of all articles published in this field between1989 and 2022； the main purpose is to reveal emerging themes and perspectives.\n\n【10】The R Bibliometrix Biblioshiny software package was used in this research. The Java application Biblioshiny for bibliometrix was developed so that researchers may use the bibliometrix pack-age in R Studio with the shiny package's web apps for functional combination research . CiteSpace， developed by Drexel Uni-versity Chaomei Chen ， is an analytical programme built on the Java platform. It can generate both tabular and graphical maps. The ability of CiteSpace to mix co-citation with visual maps makes it a valuable tool for identifying key concepts and landmarks. To do this， we generate disjointed co-citations，con-nect them into a comprehensive co-citations network， and then look for central nodes that stand out due to their unique qualities. Biblioshiny was used for standard， elementary scientomet-ric analysis because of its attractive graphical output. However， we still use CiteSpace for network mapping since it uses propri-etary techniques.\n\n【11】Every scientometric analysis begins with the data and ends with a focus on its most salient features . One thousand eight hundred sixty-eight publications relating to AI in lung cancer were retrieved from the Scopus database between 1989to 2022. The \"Collaboration Index\" is 5.4， while the \"Documents per Author\" is 0.187. The \"Collaboration Index\" of 5.44 is a positive sign that this field requires collaboration from different aspects. There is a 25.3% increase in the annual rate of scientific production. The year 2021 saw the publication of 495 articles， making it the year with the highest total number of papers.\n\n【12】Distinct country-specific publications were analysed with a total of 2103 articles and 6588 citations， and China is now in first place among all countries in the area of AI in lung cancer. On the other hand， the USA published 1858 studies as the second most country with publications but also impacted on top with the most 14832 citations and an average article citation of 39.76.\n\n【13】Country Scientific Production\n\n【14】The top twenty contributing iournals were identified， and Frontiers in Oncology 191is the leading one with 83 articles， and the second on the list is Scientific Reports with 42 articles. However， the most influential journal at the top is PLOS ONE  ， with an H-index of 16. The Scientific Reports is second with the same H-index .\n\n【15】The works of some notable authors from 2004-2022 are shown in . The red line shows the author’s productivity from the start of his career to the year he published his last scholastic\n\n【16】Impact Measiine：1\n\n【17】paper. Extra information on the impact of that year is shown in a red circle. The above chart summarises the various authors contributing to AI in lung cancer. Jiying Wang， a professor in the Department of Radiation Oncology at Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital， is on top， and his writings have only increased from2014 to 2022. In addition， Yu wang is ranked number two. The h-Index may also be used to rate authors based on the impact of their published works. The author's h-index falls between0 and 14. Jiying Wang and Yu wang have the greatest h-Index as well. They are the top authors at the same time. Harvard medical school and Stanford university are the most relevant affiliations associated with the top works in this field.\n\n【18】Top-Authors' Production over Time\n\n【19】Joost J.M. van Griethuysen's paper “Computational Ra-diomics System to Decode the Radiographic Phenotype\"is the top globally cited document in this domain which talks about Radiomic artificial intelligence (AI) technology， which may be based on designed， hard-coded algorithms or on deep learn-ing approaches to produce imaging-based biomarkers that do not need invasive procedures . Second on the list is “Deter-mining cell type abundance and expression from bulk tissues with digital cytometry\" paper by Aaron M. Newman， discussing CIBERSORT， a technique for digital cytometry that permits the determination of cell type abundances from bulk tissue transcrip-tomes . “A computer-aided detection (CAD) method for pul-monary nodules using multi-view convolutional networks (Con-vNets)， for which discriminative characteristics are automati-cally trained from the training data\" paper by Arnaud Arindra Adiyoso Setio is also highly cited.  .\n shows the most relevant keywords， which place frequently occurring words. The option allowing users to \"Load a list of terms to delete\" was used to get rid of an unwanted list of keywords. The most important keywords are “radiomics\"，“convolutional neural network\"， and “feature selection\".\n\n【20】We were able to produce a thematic map that illustrates the many different subject areas discussed in our publication by using a clustering method on the network of keywords. The plot presented in  depicts ten separate groups of in-dividuals. Radiomics in NSCLC is the word that appears most often and serves as the bubbles' name. When a phrase is used very often， a bigger bubble will form around it. The centrality and density of the cluster serve as the primary factors in deter mining the position of each bubble. The term \"density\" may be regarded as a measurement of how far advanced the issue is in its development. In contrast， \"option centrality\" reflects the theme's prominence within the broader field. Random forest im-age processing in pulmonary nodules and biomarkers in breast cancer are two of the most notable developments observed.\n\nAs seen in ， the Co-citation network provides infor-mation about the papers cluster that researchers and scientists referred to the most often by other scientists. A figure depicts the network structure， which is made up of clusters， shown in this fashion. The prominence of the writers' papers' names is meant to convey the pioneering nature of their work， and the deeper colours are intended to signify the structure's three constituent parts. For example， works by Leo Breiman on“Random forest， which is a set of tree predictors designed in such a way that each tree in the forest is reliant on the values of a random vector that is sampled randomly from each tree in the forest but follows the same distribution for each tree\"| with Konstantina Kourou together make up one cluster， are included in the red cluster， which reflects the most often mentioned works. Robert J. Gillies on radiomics is in charge of the blue cluster .\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】To decipher the emerging trends and clusters， CiteSpace soft-ware was applied to the data and the use of co-occurrence analy-sis to keywords， authors， and cited sources was done. To begin， the configuration of the programme was assigned the value\"Node Type\" to the parameter titled \"Node Type， and the value\"1\" was assigned to the time slice titled \"#Years Per Slice.\" G-index with a scale factor k= 50 was selected as the new value for the threshold of \"Selection Criteria\" for each time slice， and Pathfinder+Pruning sliced networks were the method of choice for cutting the networks. Pathfinder+Pruning sliced networks were the method of choice for cutting the networks. The Merged network included a total of 970 nodes， and its linkages contained2697 numbers. As can be seen in ， the Find clusters function in the programme was used to the keyword， authors， and referenced sources， resulting in the formation of 30 clusters. The modularity Q value of 0.8， which can be seen in ， shows decent clustering， and the mean silhouette coeffi-cient value of 0.8 indicates that the network as a whole has a nice silhouette， which lends a great deal of confidence to the network. The phrase \"burst keyword\" refers to the situation in which a certain keyword frequently appears within a specific time frame. This may occur for a variety of reasons. This data may illustrate how research hotspots have evolved， highlight current research trends， and potentially give insights about the future of the field. Fifteen references discovered in the bursts are shown in (Figure\n\n【24】9)， which may be accessed here. Theitem with the highest bursts，“Decoding tumour phenotype by noninvasive imaging using a quantitative radiomics approach\"， can be found in Cluster #3. It has a total of 3.87 bursts.\n\n【25】We constructed a timeline map  showing the cluster of keywords and authors， year by year， using the year-by-year cluster function available on CiteSpace. This allowed us to high-light when the development of research subjects first started. highlights major clusters first， including citing articles and cited references. The largest cluster (#0) has 91 members and a silhouette value of 0.825. It is labelled as comparative ge-nomic analysis by LLR. The major citing article of the cluster is HE， W (2022.0)， An mishap-based interpretation-model-guided classification method for malignant pulmonary nodule . The second largest cluster (#1) has 82 members and a silhouette value of 0.871.

According to estimates， there were 2.1 million new cases of lung cancer diagnosed in 2018， which accounted for 12% of the total can-cer burden worldwide. Artificial intelligence (AI) can replicate mental abilities in analysing， interpreting and understanding sophisticated data. When diagnosing lung cancer， combining AI algorithms with the clinical and biological data already avail-able can enhance lung cancer screening procedures. This study employs a bibliometric approach and knowledge mapping by using CiteSpace and R Biblioshiny to undertake a quantitative and visual analysis of the present state of the art in AI research in lung cancer. Various assessments were made in this study， including those of authorship， country， institution， reference ar-ticle，keyword， and reference journal. China is now in first place among all countries in the area of AI in lung cancer. Frontiers in Oncology journal is the leading one with 83 articles； second on the list is Scientific Reports with 42 articles. The USA published1858 studies as the second country with publications but also impacted on top with the most 14832 citations and an average article citation of 39.76. The Merged network， after analysis on citescore included a total of 970 nodes， and its linkages contained2697 numbers. The item with the highest bursts， \"Decoding tu-mour phenotype by noninvasive imaging using a quantitative radiomics approach\"， can be found in Cluster #3. This datamay illustrate how research hotspots have evolved. The largest cluster (#0) is labelled as comparative genomic analysis by LLR.

{"seq_id": "3cffed64-aba5-47e7-812c-773a957999e4", "title": null, "text": "【0】Background：\n\n【1】Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease that can affect any organ， including the liver. It is manifested by the presence of non-caseating granulomas within involved organs， most commonly the pulmonary lymphatic， and hepatic system. Unlike pulmonary or lymphatic involvement， hepatic involvement is usually asymptomatic and it is un-derdiagnosed. Here， we report a case of a patient with a history of pulmonary sarcoidosis who developed he-patic sarcoidosis.\n\n【2】Case Report： 68-year-old female with pulmonary sarcoidosis with a 2-week history of severe abdominal pain and epigas-tric tenderness presented to our center. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated mild he-patic fibrosis and cirrhosis. A thorough workup was performed including a liver biopsy which showed chronic non-necrotizing granulomas consistent with sarcoidosis. She was started on prednisone and subsequently im-proved. The patient was symptom-free on follow-up 1 month later.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】The majority of patients with hepatic sarcoidosis are usually asymptomatic， with only 5-30% presenting with abdominal pain， jaundice， nausea， vomiting， and hepatosplenomegaly. In rare cases， hepatic sarcoidosis can lead to cholestasis， portal hypertension， cirrhosis， or Budd-Chiari syndrome. Treatment with steroids is the mainstay of therapy； however， in severe cases， patients may require liver transplantation. This case report demonstrates that hepatic sarcoidosis is a serious condition， and if not treated， can lead to portal hypertension and cirrhosis. In patients with sarcoidosis， early detection and longitudinal follow-up is important in preventing overt liver failure.\n\n【5】MeSH Keywords： Cholestasis·Liver Cirrhosis ·Sarcoidosis\n\n【6】The prevalence of sarcoidosis in the United States is estimated to be 1-40 per 100 000 people . Hepatic involvement occurs in 11.5% of patients with sarcoidosis  and the prevalence is twice more likely in African Americans  Hepatic sarcoid-osis is usually clinically silent， however， in severe cases， it can manifest as cholestasis， cirrhosis， portal hypertension， and ul-timately，liver failure .\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】A 68-year-old Caucasian female with pulmonary sarcoidosis， hypertension， and type 2 diabetes presented to the Emergency Department with severe abdominal pain. The pain was dull， constant， and began approximately 1 month prior with pro-gression and exacerbation over the previous 2 weeks.The pain was located in her right upper quadrant and epigastric region without radiation， there was no correlation with food intake or change in position. Associated symptoms were weakness， dizziness， and nausea. She denied any systemic signs of in-fection including fevers， chills， vomiting， and diarrhea. There was no history of viral hepatitis， or alcohol or illicit drug use.\n\n【9】On physical examination， she was normotensive，tachycardic， breathing normally， and saturating well on room air but she appeared to be in moderate distress. Her respiratory exam-ination was benign. Her cardiac examination as also benign except for a mild aortic systolic murmur. Her abdomen was soft and non-distended with hypoactive bowel sounds. She was tender to palpation on her epigastrium and right upper quadrant. Mild hepatomegaly was appreciated on deep palpa-tion. The patient did not have a positive Murphy's sign but did have slight voluntary guarding without rebound tenderness.\n\n【10】Admission lab work demonstrated a cholestatic pattern of liver injury. Other significant labs included， elevated calcium level and 1，25-hydroxy vitamin D . A magnetic reso-nance imaging (MRI) of the liver demonstrated mild fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver with hepatosplenomegaly . A computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen showed scattered calcified granulomas within the lungs， liver， and spleen. The pancreas was normal and there were some enlarged upper abdominal lymph nodes. The patient under-went a thorough workup for etiology of granulomatous liver disease and pertinent negative labs included： anti-mitochon-drial antibody， anti-smooth antibody， antinuclear antibody， and viral hepatitis serology. Finally， a liver biopsy showed chronicgranulomatous hepatitis with compact non-necrotizing granu-lomas， minimal steatosis， and no stainable iron seen in hepa-tocytes in and eosin (H&E stain)， 200x， and Figure 2B， trichome stain， 200x). Fungal cultures， acid-fast bacilli， and gram stain were all negative on biopsy. Cardiac MRI was negative for cardiac involvement of her sarcoidosis. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed showing small gastric sessile polyps but otherwise negative for varices.\n\n| Test  |  | Result  | Reference range  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Aspartate aminotransferase  |  | 23U/L  | (0-41IU/L)  |\n| Alanine aminotransferase  |  | 11U/L  | IU/L  |\n|  | Alkaline phosphatase  | 512 IU/L  | (30-130IU/L)  |\n|  | Total bilirubin  | 1.4 mg/dL  | (0-1.0mg/dL)  |\n|  | PT/INR  | 14.4 sec/1.1  | (12.5-14.7 sec/0.9-1.1)  |\n|  | Albumin  | 2.5 g/dL  | (3.5-5.5 g/dL)  |\n|  | Serum calcium  | 15.5 mg/dL  | (8.5-10.5 mg/dL)  |\n|  | Intact PTH  | 3 pg/mL  | (12-88 pg/mL)  |\n|  | PTHrP  | 2 pmol/L  | (0-3.4 pmol/L)  |\n| Total 25 hydroxy vitamin D2 D3  |  | 24 ng/mL  | (30-100 ng/mL)  |\n|  | 1，25-hydroxy vitamin D  | 151 pg/mL  | (19.9-79.3 pg/mL)  |\n|  | ACE  | <5 u/L  | (9-67 IU/L】  |\n| Anti-mitochondrial antibody  |  | Negative  |  |\n| Anti-smooth antibody  |  | Negative  |  |\n| Antinuclear antibody  |  | Negative  |  |\n| Viral hepatitis serology  |  | Negative  |  |\n|  | Additional tests on liver biopsy  |  |  |\n| Fungal cultures  |  | Negative  |  |\n| Acid-fast bacilli  |  | Negative  |  |\n| Gram stain and cultures  |  | Negative  |  |\n\n【12】Elevated serum calcium， low intact parathyroid hormone (PTH)， and elevated 1，25 hydroxy vitamin D were consistent with hy-percalcemia secondary to sarcoidosis. She had a known his-tory of pulmonary sarcoidosis； however， the hepatic involve-ment made this case noteworthy. Our differential diagnosis for non-caseating granuloma included hepatic sarcoidosis， fungalinfections， tuberculosis， primary biliary cirrhosis， lymphoma， and drug reactions. She tested negative for anti-mitochondrial antibody， fungal infections， tuberculosis， and lymphoma. The patient was not on any medications that have been known to cause non-caseating granulomas， thus raising suspicion for he-patic sarcoidosis， which was ultimately confirmed via histology\n\n【13】The patient was treated with prednisone 30 mg twice a day in the hospital and was discharged on a prolonged predni-sone course. Her symptoms improved， and she was discharged home after an 11-day hospital stay. The patient did not have reoccurrence of her symptoms at a follow-up 1 month later.\n\n【14】The majority of patients with hepatic sarcoidosis are asymp-tomatic， with only 5-30% presenting with abdominal pain， jaundice， nausea， vomiting， and hepatosplenomegaly . In rare cases， hepatic sarcoidosis can lead to cholestasis， portal hypertension， cirrhosis， or Budd-Chiari syndrome .\n\n【15】Patients with hepatic sarcoidosis seldom have elevated trans-aminases and alkaline phosphatase. Hepatic and splenic lesions are seen in 5% and 15% of patients， respectively . Our pa-tient had radiographic evidence of hepatic cirrhosis and portal hypertension but was clinically compensated. Previous studies have failed to prove the correlation of transaminases with dis-ease severity. In those with severe hepatic involvement，higher levels of both transaminases and alkaline phosphatase might be seen . In addition， the patient's esophagogastroduode-noscopy did not show evidence of varices. Hypoalbuminemia and hyperbilirubinemia are rarely seen and are associated with cirrhosis .\n\n【16】Liver biopsy is recommended for patients suspected of having symptomatic hepatic sarcoidosis (e.g.， elevated serum amino-transferase and alkaline phosphatase) . Other diseases that can cause hepatic granulomas， such as fungal infections， tu-berculosis， primary biliary cirrhosis， lymphoma， and drug re-actions， should be excluded. In symptomatic patients， an in-crease in serum angiotensin converting enzyme level might be seen， but levels are normal in 25% of untreated patients .\n\n【17】Hypercalcemia occurs in 11% of patients with sarcoidosis， while hypercalciuria and renal calculi occur in 40% and 10%， respectively . Granulomas contain 25-hydroxyvitamin D-10-hydroxylase， which converts 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1，25 dihy-droxyvitamin D，thus leading to hypercalcemia. Early recognition and treatment of hypercalcemia is important before intrarenal calcium deposition occurs， which leads to renal failure .\n\n【18】In patients with symptomatic hepatic sarcoidosis， treat-ment with steroids is recommended for at least 6 months. Kennedy et al. reported on 63 patients with hepatic sarcoidosis when treated with steroids， out of which one-third had a com-plete clinical response， one-third had a partial response， and one-third had no response . The definitive treatment of symp-tomatic hepatic sarcoidosis is liver transplantation； however， recurrence of the disease is possible in the new organ .\n\n【19】Conclusions\n\n【20】Hepatic sarcoidosis should be considered in patients with un-derlying systemic sarcoidosis presenting with abdominal pain， jaundice， nausea， vomiting， and hepatosplenomegaly. Prior to liver biopsy， other etiologies that may result in hepatic gran-ulomas should first be excluded. Treatment with steroids is the mainstay of therapy for hepatic sarcoidosis， however， in severe cases patients may require liver transplantation.Our case demonstrates that hepatic sarcoidosis is a serious con-dition， and if not treated， could lead to a variety of complica-tions， including portal hypertension， cirrhosis， or Budd-Chiari syndrome. In patients with sarcoidosis， early detection and lon-gitudinal follow-up is important in preventing overt liver failure.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "a73b92a3-1abc-48d1-9520-d023bd264599", "title": null, "text": "【0】ABSTRACT There are many causes of psychosis. Some of them are medically related， while others are psychiatric. In this case， we explore causes of psychosis related to mildly elevated CSF protein in a 27 yo patient with unique physical exam findings： dysphagia， tachycardia， and psychosis refractory to antipsychotic treatment (including a moderate 200 mg dose of Clozapine). Ultimately we did not discover any medically known cause of her psychosis. Still， our final differential diagnosis included immune-mediated encephalitis， possibly due to COVID-19 or an unknown medical cause. We find it unlikely that this patient has a primary psychiatric disorder as they had no clinical benefit from Invega Sustenna， Olanzapine， and a moderate 200 mg dose of Clozapine.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Psychosis， encephalitis， COVID-19， treatment refractory\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Elevated CSF protein with CSF oligoclonal bands is a nonspecific finding that indicates possible dysfunction in the blood-brain barrier， CSF flow， CSF inflammation， or intrathecal immunoglob-ulin production . Abnormal CSF findings (ele-vated LDH， protein， glucose) are often present in both medical and psychiatric illnesses， so changes in the CSF parameters are not pathognomonic for any illness . Oddly， it is also possible to have autoimmune encephalitis and have completely normal CSF . Still more perplexing， coronavirus has previously been implicated in psychosis as early as 2011， and， since the COVID-19 pandemic has begun， several studies have shown that it too can precipitate psychosis (Smith2021) as well as alter CSF markers .\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 27-year-old Hispanic female presented to the ED for psychosis. She has a medical history significant for premature birth (@~24weeks with 2 months in the ICU)， developmental delay (mother reports patient should have been in special education classes)， mild symptomatic COVID infection January 2022， and Hx of left oophorectomy for an unknown ovarian cancer in her teen years. She had no prior psychiatric hx and no family psychiatric Hx of severe mental illness.\n\n【6】Her family states that she was in normal health， could hold a job packing at a warehouse， and had a good relationship with her boyfriend， family， and friends until she was discovered un-conscious on the floor from an unwitnessed fall in her house February 2022 by her 5-year-old son. It was unclear what pre-cipitated this fall and for how long she experienced a loss of consciousness.\n\n【7】After her fall， she began acting bizarrely， staying up late at night， pacing her room， talking about shooting from her past， and saying she would \"kill herself because I cannot sleep.\" She was hospitalized at an inpatient psychiatric hospital for 1 week in March 2022， given two paliperidone injections (254 mg IM and 156 mg IM)， and subsequently discharged， but her psychosispersisted. Finally， she was brought to our ED after biting her boyfriend. At the same time， he was asleep， and her family reported that she had increasingly unprovoked and unexplained aggressive behaviour.\n\n【8】The patient was admitted to neurology to rule out encephali-tis. Bush Francis’s catatonia scale was initially 22， so she was started on Ativan 1 mg PO TID which resulted in respiratory de-pression and no improvement in apparent catatonia， so this was discontinued. However， 26-minute EEG was normal (despite administration of lorazepam)， and her MRI brain with contrast was unremarkable， with no change in signal intensity to sug-gest autoimmune encephalitis. US abdomen showed absent left ovary with normal right ovary as did MRI abdomen and pelvis with contrast.\n\n【9】Extensive laboratory testing (CBC，CMP，UA，UDS， cortisol， urine hCG， AFP， TSH， vitamin B12， folate， syphilis Ab， thiamine， phosphate， magnesium，ANA， CRP， ESR) were all normal.\n\n【10】LP showed elevated protein ，but glucose， opening pres-sure， and cell studies were normal； CSF meningitis panel，coc-cidiomycosis， and west Nile ab were also negative. In addition， paraneoplastic and autoimmune encephalitis labs were negative(both in CSF and serum) with send-out to Mayo Clinic. CSF and serum Oligoclonal bands are at present pending.\n\n【11】The patient was started on empiric treatment for encephali-tis after lumbar puncture， Methylprednisone 1000 mg ⅣV for5 days and IVIG with no improvement in symptoms. Due to dysphagia and weight loss， a peg tube was placed by general surgery， which was subsequently removed by the patient and required replacement. Since the patient continued pulling on her peg tube， she was intermittently placed in 4-point restraints the following month.\n\n【12】She remained selectively mute and non-verbal， answering questions with grunts throughout her stay in April and May. Notably， she was also tachycardic during this time with HR in the low 90s. Because of her continued agitation， she was trialled on Depakote 750 mg PO TID with a trough level of 76. Still， Depakote was discontinued when the patient developed throm-bocytopenia and when it had little effect on her agitation and altered mental status. She was subsequently tried on Ambien10 mg qHS PRN for sleep and Haldol， Propranolol 20 mg q6PRN， and Olanzapine 5 mg PO BID， all with little effect， so the team decided to rapidly titrate Clozapine to 200 mg daily. Un-fortunately， this also had no clinical effect and was tapered and discontinued after another two weeks.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】What do we make of a 27-vear-old female unresponsive to an-tipsychotics with a mild change in their CSF protein and an otherwise completely unremarkable and extensive workup?\n\n【15】We believe several clinical signs point to a primarily medical rather than psychiatric aetiology. These include unresponsive-ness to antipsychotics (especially at an adequate dose for an adequate duration： olanzapine 5 BID， Invega sustenna with adequate loading， and Clozapine titrated to 200 mg)， physical exam findings consistent with medical illness (dysphagia and tachycardia)， acute onset of psychosis after a fall， no family Hx of primary psychiatric disorder， and no prodromal symptoms consistent with schizophrenia or other primary psychiatric psy-chotic disorder. The psychiatric attending managing this case even saw a video of the patient weeks prior to her illness； she seemed happy， personable， and outgoing， with no perceptible illness.\n\n【16】Beyond the thought that this patient's illness is medical rather than psychiatric， there is very little evidence to point to any known illness. The patient did not meet the clinical criteria for encephalitis . Their autoimmune panel was normal， their EEG showed only diffuse wave slowing， which is non-specific， MRI brain as well as abdomen were normal， and an extensive laboratory workup (including lumbar puncture) was also normal， except for a mildly elevated protein-which by itself is very non-specific.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】We are left feeling very unsettled by this case. Sometimes， it seems like there is no clinical evidence to point to a specific diagnosis or treatment. Here is a patient with a very exten-sive workup and empiric encephalitis treatment in addition to schizophrenia treatment with very little clinical improvement.\n\n【19】Summaries of Studies\n\n【20】Zetterberg 2017\n\n【21】Mental disorders or antipsychotic treatment can cause dys-function in the BBB or cerebrospinal flow and a resultant eleva-tion in CSF protein.\n\n【22】Graus 2017.\n\n【23】Absence of antibodies does not exclude the possibility that a disorder is immune mediated.\n\n【24】Classic symptoms of NMDA encepahlitis： abnormal behavior(psychosis) with irritability and insomnia followed by speech dysfunction， dyskinesia， memory deficits， autonomic instability and decreased level of consciousness.\n\n【25】Three levels for autoimmune encephalitis： possible，probable and definite：\n\n【26】·Possible criteria she meets：  subacute onset， AMS， or psychotic symptoms；  new focal CNS findings (i.e. dys-phagia) and  reasonable exclusion of other causes\n\n【27】·FProbable criteria for NMDA she meets if oligoclonal bands are positive\n\n【28】· For patients with negative autoantibodies and meeting probable criteria “detection of new antibodies in serum and CSF in reference labs is important.\"\n\n【29】Bauer 1987\n\n【30】Overall conclusion was that schizophrenics prior to pro-longed antipsychotic antipsychotic have blood brain dysfunction with elevated CSF protein， however only 1 patient in this study of 15 patients had a total protein value higher than our patient.\n\n【31】Orlavska-Waast 2019\n\n【32】(systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on mental illness and CSF)\n\n【33】Schizophrenia spectrum disorders is associated with BBB dysfunction and evenintrathecal production of immunoglobulin\n\n【34】·Total protein (3 studies with 97 patients)\n\n【35】\\- Standard mean difference was 0.41 (95% CI was 0.15-0.67)； no difference from normal controls\n\n【36】·Oligoclonal bands in 12.5% of cases\n\n【37】Zemen 1993\n\n【38】·OCB of IgG provides evidence of the production of antibod-ies but it does not tell you where the antibodies are being produced (CSF vs. Plasma).\n\n【39】\\- If present in CSF and absent in serum then strong evidence of intrathecal response\n\n【40】\\- If present in serum and not CSF then production is in serur\n\n【41】If present in both CSF and serum then likely serum except if CSF has additional bands that serum does not contain\n\n【42】·Causes of OCB： infection， inflammation， paraneoplastic， neoplastic， GBS， peripheral neuropathies， MS， vasculitis， degenerative disorders.\n\n【43】Tandon 2021 CSF studies and COVID 19\n\n【44】· COVID 19 can result in an encephalitis\n\n【45】·CSF protein elevated in all fatal cases (average protein 61) and in 74% of non-severe cases (average protein 56)\n\n【46】· In many cases PCR for COVID was negative for CSF\n\n【47】Seyfurt 2002 (determinants of CSF protein concentration)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "b9fd4140-fa3e-427c-adc3-78a89dfb5ab8", "title": null, "text": "【0】Background：\n\n【1】Due to the anatomical and biomechanical characteristics of the shoulder， traumatic soft-tissue lesions are more common than osseous lesions. Superior labrum anterior-posterior (SLAP) lesions are an uncommon a cause of shoulder pain. SLAP is injury or separation of the glenoid labrum superior where the long head of biceps ad-heres. SLAP lesions are usually not seen on plain direct radiographs. Shoulder MRI and magnetic resonance ar-thrography are useful for diagnosis.\n\n【2】Case Report： A 57-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department due to a low fall on his shoulder. In physical examination， active and passive shoulder motion was normal except for painful extension. Anterior-posterior shoulder x-ray imaging was normal. The patient required orthopedics consultation in the emergency observa-tion unit due to persistent shoulder pain. In shoulder MRI， performed for diagnosis， type Il lesion SLAP was de-tected. The patient was referred to a tertiary hospital due to lack of arthroscopy in our hospital.\n\n【3】Conclusions： Shoulder traumas are usually soft-tissue injuries with no findings in x-rays. SLAP lesion is an uncommon cause of traumatic shoulder pain. For this reason， we recommend orthopedic consultation in post-traumatic persis-tent shoulder pain.\n\n【4】Key words： trauma \\* shoulder pain · superior labrum anterior posterior lesions\n\n【5】The shoulder has a great range of motion in the body， with complete global movement that allows positioning the arm anywhere in space. Due to the high degree of motion capabili-ty of the shoulder complex， it is highly sensitive to any type of trauma. Traumatic soft-tissue lesions are more common than osseous lesions due to the characteristic anatomical and bio-mechanical properties of the shoulder. There are various causes of shoulder pain， often related with rotator cuff (RC) injuries. These problems usually occur with repetitive micro-traumas. Superior labrum anterior-posterior (SLAP) lesions are un-common as a cause of shoulder pain after trauma. SLAP is in-jury or separation of the glenoid labrum superior where the long head of the biceps adheres .\n\n【6】We emphasize the need to consider the diagnosis of SLAP le-sions in post-traumatic shoulder pain in emergency depart-ment patients.\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】A 57-year-old man was admitted to our emergency department due to a low fall on his shoulder. In physical examination，ac-tive and passive shoulder motion was normal except for pain-ful extension. Anterior-posterior shoulder x-ray imaging was normal . A type 2 SLAP lesion was detected in fat-suppressed axial T2-weighted MRI sequences . The patient was referred to a tertiary hospital due to lack of arthroscopy in our hospital.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】SLAP lesion of the shoulder is generally related with a fall dur-ing the abduction of the arm. This rare injury causes persistent pain in the shoulder. Synder et al defined 4 types of lesions and Mohana-Borges et al defined 10 types of SLAP lesions . We diagnosed a type 2 SLAP lesion in our patient. The clinical di-agnosis of SLAP lesions is extremely challenging. History and physical examination is not sufficient for a definitive diagnosis. Although there are tests that are helpful in the diagnosis， phys-ical examination and history are not useful for definitive diag-nose of a SLAP lesion. Reports in the literature describe at least26 maneuvers as useful in helping to make the diagnosis of a SLAP lesion  Cook et al. reported that the strongest pos-itive predictive value and negative predictive value of the these tests were provided by the Kim Test Il and the Labral Tension test.\n\n【11】Plain radiographs are non-diagnostic for SLAP lesions. MRl and MRI arthrography of the shoulder are useful diagnostic tools. Arthroscopic examination is the current method of choice in undiagnosed patients .\n\n【12】SLAP lesions of the shoulder result in functional disorders， bio-mechanical limitations， and persistent shoulder pain. Surgical treatment is required in symptomatic patients. The arthroscop-ic method is sufficient in most patients. Undifferentiated form or bucket handle tears are debrided in the arthroscopicmethod. Complete tears are fixed to the glenoid with anchors. Transplantation of biceps tendon to the intertubercular groove is recommended in multi-fragment degenerative tears . Our case was referred to an arthroscopy center.\n\n【13】Conclusions\n\n【14】Shoulder injuries are generally related to soft-tissue injuries， and plain radiographs are not useful to evaluate soft-tiss ue injuries.

Bone involvement of xanthogranulomatous inflammation， termed xanthogranulomatous osteomyeli-tis (X0)， often presents as a mass-like lesion extending to adjacent structures， which can mimic infiltrative carcinoma.\n\n【2】Case Report： We present a case of XO in the ulna， which mimicked a neoplasm. A 59-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of painful swelling in the right wrist. Plain radiography and CT showed an osteolytic lesion at the dis-tal ulna. MRI revealed a soft-tissue mass with lobulated margins and contrast enhancement. Intense uptake in bone scan and PET suggested malignancy. An excisional biopsy from the representative area resulted in a pa-thology diagnosis of XO.\n\n【3】Conclusions： Gross and radiologic manifestations of XO can mimic neoplasm. XO generally has benign prognosis， con-trary to malignant bone tumor. Therefore， biopsy and histopathological confirmation are necessary for proper management.\n\n【4】Key words： xanthogranulomatous osteomyelitis · inflammatory· ulna·image\n\n【5】Xanthogranulomatous inflammation is a chronic inflammato ry disease histologically characterized by collection of foamy macrophages admixed with polymorphonuclear leukocytes， ac-tivated plasma cells， and lymphocytes of polyclonal origin， in a mosaic-like pattern . The most common sites of involve-ment are the kidney and gallbladder ； however， it can oc-cur in many other organs， including the lymph nodes， colon， appendix，pancreas， urinary bladder， prostate， testis，epididy-mis， endometrium， ovaries， fallopian tubes， vagina， and sali-vary glands. Xanthogranulomatous inflammation rarely occurs in lung， brain， or bone .\n\n【6】Bone involvement of xanthogranulomatous inflammation， termed xanthogranulomatous osteomyelitis (XO)， often pres-ents as a mass-like lesion extending to adjacent structures， and can mimic infiltrative carcinoma . XO may also accompany inflammatory signs of pain， fever， and leukocytosis， due to a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction of cell-mediated immu-nity. Therefore， distinguishing infection from neoplasm is an important first step in diagnosing XO. The differential diagnosis of xanthogranulomatous osteomyelitis includes Langerhans cell histiocytoses， Erdheim-Chester disease， and chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis . Clinical manifestation and ra-diologic findings are important in the decision， as well as histo-pathological diagnosis， which can confirm the diagnosis of XO.\n\n【7】XO is rare and only 6 cases have been reported： 2 in 1984 by Cozzutto et al.， 1 in 2007 by Vankalakunti et al. ， 1 in2009 by Cennimo et al. ， 1 in 2011 by Borjian et al.， and by 1 Kamat et al.  in 2011. To the best of our knowl-edge， this is the seventh reported case of xanthogranuloma-tous inflammation in bone. We report this rare XO case with the radiologic features of simple radiography， PET/CT， and MRI.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 59-year-old man was referred to the orthopedics department of our institution， presenting a 2-month history of right wrist pain with swelling. He had no trauma history or previous sur-gical history of the right wrist. He had a past medical history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and rheumatoid arthri-tis， diagnosed 6 years before. He had been taking antifungal medicine (itraconazole) for 2 months and vitamin A and D for3 months for multiple furunculosis of the face， neck， and axil-la. Upon systematic review， the patient’s right wrist had mild limitation of motion and swelling. Physical examination of his right wrist revealed tenderness with local heat and without motor or sensory impairment. Lab studies showed leukocyto-penia (white blood cell count of 2120 cells/mL with a normal distribution of neutrophils %\\]， lymphocytes %\\]，andeosinophils %\\]， and slightly elevated monocytes %\\])and mild thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 10 800 cells/mL) that had been consistently low due to his history of MDS. Other lab studies， including liver function tests and renal function tests， were within normal limits， and his vital signs were stable， with-out fever. The clinical impression according to his symptoms， signs， and laboratory data could suggest metastasis or myelo-ma involvement， considering his age and prior history of MDS.\n\n【10】Plain radiography of the wrist revealed a bulging mass-like le-sion located at the distal ulna with a round radiolucent lesion of the distal ulna， suggesting an osteolytic mass . CT of the wrist showed a lobulated soft-tissue-density mass about2x2x4 cm involving the ventral-medial side of the distal ulna， with a focal cortical defect of the bone . On MRI， the lobulated mass on the distal ulna displayed low signal in-tensity on T1-weighted image， and high signal intensity on T2-weighted image， and was strongly enhanced by gadolinium in-jection . The lobulated contour， with the extending pattern of the lesion into the adjacent soft tissues and location of the lesion itself， suggested infection， but the adjacent bone marrow edema was relatively minimal. Therefore， a tumorous lesion， such as primary bone tumor， metastasis/myeloma， or lymphoproliferative disease (Castleman’s disease)，seemed more probable， and infection seemed less likely. Whole body bone scan(WBBS) and PET-CT scan were performed to detect any other lesions. The WBBS revealed increased uptake in the right dis-tal ulna， a finding suspicious for a bony tumor. The PET-CT also showed focal intense fludeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the dis-tal part of right ulna， compatible with malignancy， with no oth-er abnormal FDG uptakes to indicate metastasis .\n\n【11】The radiological diagnosis of the wrist lesion focused more on a malignant lesion than infection， but， controversial as this diagno-sis is， confirmation by pathology was recommended. A surgical incisional biopsy of the distal part of right ulna was performed， and microscopic findings showed acute and chronic inflamma-tion， with extensive infiltration of foamy macrophages， most likely consistent with xanthogranulomatous osteomyelitis. The excisional biopsy was used to completely rule out malignancy， since radiologic findings suggested neoplasm ratherthan infec-tion. In the operating room， the exposed distal ulna had a mass lesion that manifested malignant behavior aggressively invad-ing upon enclosing tissue. The lesion was completely excised and curetted out， and the soft tissue and bony tissue from the ulna were sent to the pathology department for histopathologic inspection. Upon gross examination， the tissue presented as an ill-defined mass-like lesion. The specimen had diffuse infiltra-tion of mixed inflammatory cells， including neutrophils， small lymphocytes， and plasma cells admixed with aggregated foamy macrophages on light microscopy. The foamy macrophages had a distinct cytoplasmic border， abundant pale eosinophilic gran-ular cytoplasm， and a small round nucleus .\n\n【12】The final pathologic diagnosis was confirmed as xanthogran-ulomatous osteomyelitis based on the acute and chronic in-flammation， with extensive infiltration of foamy macrophages and formation of granulation tissue.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Xanthogranulomatous osteomyelitis (XO) is a notable disease in terms of its rarity. Only 6 cases of XO have been reported in the literature . Cozzutto et al 1 first reported 2 cases of involvement of the first rib in a 5-year-old boy and the proximal metaphysis of the tibia in a 14-year-old boy in 1984. In 2007， Vankalakunti et al.  reported a case of 50-year-old woman presenting XO in diaphysis of ulna. Cennimo et al. reported a case that manifested as a xanthogranulomatous reaction with culture results positive for Mycobacterium marinum in the index finger and wrist of a 41-year-old sushi chef in 2009. Recently， a case of XO invading 2 separate bones， the metaphysis of theright humerus and the medulla， metaphysis， and diaphysis of the left fibula， in a 14-year-old boy was published by Borjian et al. Another case of XO， which presented as swelling in the right distal tibia， in a 13-year-old boy was reported by Kamat et al. Here， we report the seventh case of xanthogranulo-matous inflammation in bone， a case of a XO in the distal ulna.\n\n【15】We report this case due to its imaging findings on simple radio-graph， CT，MRI， WBBS， and PET-CT， and the importance of dif-ferential diagnosis with malignancy， therefore we could pres-ent various radiologic features of XO. XO is generally benign and curable， but it can mimic malignant bone tumor clinical-ly and radiologically. Our case of XO is remarkable in that the CT and MR images showed an enhancing mass in the ulna， with focal uptake in WBBS and PET-CT， which should be distin-guished from malignant tumors. At present， imaging XO does not suggest a specific finding to make a convincing diagnosis. Therefore， histopathological examination seems to be neces-sary to accurately diagnose XO.\n\n| Case reports  | Region  | Culture results  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cozzutto C.  | Case 1 (15t rib)  | No organisms  |\n|  | Case 2 (proximal metaphysis of tibia)  | No organisms  |\n| Vankalakunti M.， Saikia U.N.， Mathew M. et al.  | Diaphysis of ulna  | No organisms  |\n| Cennimo D.J.， Agag R.， Fleegler E. et al.   | Index finger and wrist  | Mycobacterium marinum  |\n| Borjian A.， Rezaei F.， Eshaghi M.A. et al.  | Metaphysis of the humerus and themedulla， metaphysis， and diaphysis of thefibula  | Staphytococcus aureus  |\n| Kamat G. et al.   | Distal tibia  | Staphytococcus aureus  |\n\n【17】Microscopic differential diagnosis for xanthogranulomatous osteomyelitis includes Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) and Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) . Unifocal LCH may present as a single osteolytic lesion， generally affecting long or flat bones . However， bone involvement usually occurs in pediatric patients， with a median age of 5， and Birbeck gran-ules， a diagnostic hallmark ， were missing in our case， therefore LCH could be ruled out. ECD is a systemic condition characterized by multisystemic xanthogranulomatous infiltra-tion， including bone involvement affecting middle-aged adults. Our patient did not show any other site of inflammation on WBBS and PET； therefore， ECD was ruled out. Accordingly， histopathology should distinguish pseudotumoral XO from bone tumors or other benign conditions.\n\n【18】Conclusions\n\n【19】Xanthogranulomatous osteomyelitis is extremely rare and its preoperative diagnosis is a challenge because it canradiographically mimic a malignant tumor. Xo generally has a benign prognosis， contrary to malignant bone tumor； there-fore， biopsy and histopathological confirmation are necessary tor proper management.\n\n【20】Teaching point\n\n【21】Xanthogranulomatous osteomyelitis (XO) is extremely rare， and its preoperative diagnosis is a challenge because it can mimic a malignant tumor on radiologic examinations， includ-ing simple radiograph， CT， MR， and PET. Gross and radiologic manifestations of XO can mimic neoplasm； therefore， XO needs differential diagnosis from malignancy and histopathological confirmation is necessary for proper management. Although image features can mimic the malignancy， the radiologist must be aware of the possibility of the XO.\n\n【22】Conflicts of interest and source of funding\n\n【23】There is no conflict of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

We undertook a descriptive cross-sectional study of cutaneous biopsy specimens received in our practice， aiming to document the pattern of practice and the range of underlying causative pathologies in skin biopsies of a black African population. A search of our digital archives was conducted and histopathology reports and requisition forms of all skin biopsy cases accessioned between January 1， 2000， and December 31， 2018， were identified. Data were extracted and analyzed. Skin biopsies constituted 10% (2687/26745) of all surgical specimens. Out of the 2547 biopsies included in the study， 62.5%(1602/2547) came from surgery specialities (general， plastic and paediatric surgery) while 37.1%(945/2547) came from the dermatology department. The techniques of biopsy done were excision (63.4% of all biopsies)； incision (0.6%)； and punch (36%). 126 pathologies were diagnosed. The most frequent pathology was squamous cell carcinoma (7.9% of all biopsies) followed by epidermoid cyst (4.9%) and psoriasis (4.6%). 25 diseases entities accounted for 70.4% of all diagnoses. 176 different disease entities were the underlying cause of all the biopsies and only 25 of these accounted for over 70% of all diagnoses. Surgeons submitted more cutaneous biopsies than dermatologists did. There was a strong association between groups of dermatological disease， the technique of biopsy and attending speciality.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Skin biopsies， African skin， Black skin biopsies， dermatopathology\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】The skin， with its associated accessory structures， has the priv-ileged recognition as the biggest organ of the human body， ac-counting for about 16% of total body weight . It is an all-encompassing coat which in addition to many other crucial functions， shields all other body tissues from harmful environ-mental insults. The vast size of the skin， its unique defensive position and constant exposure to hazardous environmentalagents predispose it to numerous injuries and diseases. Over3000 skin diseases are currently documented in the literature. Also， the International Classification of Diseases 11th Re-vision (ICD-11) lists over 800 unique diagnosis codes for skin diseases in its Chapter 14 (Diseases of Skin)， even with skin neo-plasms excluded and many distinct entities incorporated into'other specified'subheadings . It is therefore hardly surprising that skin diseases are among the most common health problems globally and are associated with considerable epidemiological， psychological and economic burdens A\\].\n\n【4】The bedrock of dermatological diagnosis is a clinical assess-ment with a gross morphological examination. However， a skin biopsy is commonly undertaken to evaluate suspected neoplasm or resolve the differential diagnoses of non-specific lesions . A study quantifying the value of skin biopsy in assessing in-flammatory dermatosis reports that histologic diagnosis of skin biopsy provided a working diagnosis for patient treatment inabout 75% of the cases and identified some not previously con-sidered diagnoses in 13% of the cases . Skin biopsy is an invaluable tool in dermatology practice.\n\n【5】The skin of colour and Caucasian skin have differences in incidence and presentation of some dermatological conditions. These differences have been attributed partly to disparities in skin biology， structure and function . Analysis of skin biop-sies does yield data on the pattern and prevalence of skin dis-eases. Current knowledge about the epidemiology of skin dis-ease in our setting is mostly from hospital dermatologic clinic studies . Additional and fuller perspectives about the dermatopathology of black skin can be derived by analyzing skin biopsies. Some skin conditions present to other depart-ments， and some skin biopsies originate from specialities other than dermatology. The present study examines the skin biopsies received in our Histopathology laboratory over 19 years in or-der to determine the range of underlying pathologies in black African skins.\n\n【6】Material and Methods\n\n【7】This is a descriptive cross-sectional study of all skin specimens received at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital， Ituku-Ozalla， (UNTH) from January 1， 2000， to December 31， 2018. UNTH is a university teaching hospital and a tertiary referral centre situated in Enugu state， south-eastern Nigeria， which currently has about a 4.4million people by Nigeria’s National Population Commission projections . Enugu State (6.44°N；7.5E) has a humid tropical savanna climate. The record high and low temperatures are 35 and 20C， respectively， the average sunshine ranges from 3.8hours(July) to 7.3 hours (November)， and the yearly average relative humidity is 56.1%.Enugu state constitutes the major catchment population of UNTH， but people from adjoining states of Anambra， Imo， Abia， Ebonyi and Kogi commonly utilize its facilities. Being a referral centre， it attracts patients from all socioeconomic strata without any bias. The UNTH research ethics committee approved the study.\n\n【8】A search of our digital archives was undertaken， and histopathology reports of all skin biopsies submitted in the pe-riod under review were identified. A skin biopsy was defined as a tissue specimen incorporating the epidermis and dermis with or without the subcutis， removed for diagnostic and/or curative purposes. Biopsies of anal fistula and Bartholin’s cyst， as well as deeper lesions and masses that extended to the skin， were excluded. Also excluded were cases with no demographic information， no clear diagnosis， and cases diagnosed as normal skin. Data were extracted from the histopathology report and the archived requisition forms submitted by the clinician. Data ob-tained included the patient’s gender， age， date of biopsy， type of biopsy， site of biopsy， requesting department and histopatholog-ical diagnosis. Also extracted were clinical information supplied by the clinician， such as duration of sym SyIptoms， distribution of lesions， lesion size， albino status and HV status. Classifi-cation and grouping of diagnoses were done according to the provisions of ICD-11.\n\n【9】Data obtained were analyzed with the Statistical Package for Social Science software， and results were presented in tables of frequencies. Continuous variables were presented as mean with standard deviation—Alpha level of <0.05 was considered significant， and figures were produced with Ggplot2 package of R software.\n\n【10】Results\n\n【11】Out of the 26，745 specimens accessioned within the study period，2，687 (10%) were skin biopsies， translating to an average of 141skin biopsies per year. Of these skin biopsies， 140 cases were excluded from further analysis as they did not meet the inclusion criteria leaving 2，547 specimens as the definitive sample size of this studvV.\n\n【12】The demographic characteristics of patients undergoing skin biopsies are shown in Table 1. More females than males un-derwent skin biopsies， and there was a significant difference between the proportions of the two genders. Fig 1 shows several biopsies by age categories and gender. Fig 2 shows the trend of skin biopsies over the years. The highest number of biopsies per annum  was received in 2011， while the lowest numbers were seen between 2001 and 2005. The staffing problems expe-rienced in our Pathology department at this time may explain the plunging numbers seen in those particular years. Table 2shows the attending or requesting department， type of biopsy done， and region of the body biopsied. The majority (62%) of the biopsies came from surgery specialities， including general， plastic and paediatric surgical specialities， while the Dermatol-ogy department was responsible for 37.1% (945/2547) biopsies.\n\n【13】Table 3 demonstrates the relationship between groups of skin disease， the department(s) to which they presented and the preferred biopsy technique in their investigation. Surgery and dermatology specialities are the key sources of skin biopsies. There was a strong relationship between the nature of skin dis-\n\n【14】December 2018.\n\n| Variable  | Value  | p-value； statistics  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gender Male Female M：F ratio  | 1，147(45%) 1，400(55%) 1：1.2  | p<0.001 (one-sample binomial test)  |\n| Age Mean Age (SD) Mean age (SD) male Mean age (SD) female Age range  | 38.5(19.1)years 39.0(20.1) years 37.1(18.2) years 1.2 months-91 years  | p=0.17； t=1.370 (t-test)  |\n| Age groups (years) 0-4 5-14 15-24 25-34 35-44 45-54 55-64 65-74 75-84 85+ Total  | Count (%) 71(2.8) 187(7.3) 396(15.5) 514(20.2) 392(15.4) 419(16.5) 298(11.7) 185(7.3) 73(2.9) 12(0.5) 2，547(100.0)  |  |\n\n| Variable  | Categories  | Number of cases  | Percent (%)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Attending department  | Dermatology  | 945  | 37.1  |\n| Attending department  | General medicine  | 10  | 0.4  |\n| Attending department  | Surgery  | 1，592  | 62.5  |\n| Attending department  | Total  | 2，547  | 100.0  |\n| Type of biopsy  | Excision  | 1，615  | 63.4  |\n| Type of biopsy  | Incision  | 15  | 0.6  |\n| Type of biopsy  | Punch  | 917  | 36.0  |\n| Type of biopsy  | Total  | 2，547  | 100.0  |\n| Site of biopsy  | Head and neck  | 547  | 21.5  |\n| Site of biopsy  | Upper limbs  | 322  | 12.6  |\n| Site of biopsy  | Trunk  | 390  | 15.3  |\n| Site of biopsy  | Lower limbs  | 490  | 19.2  |\n| Site of biopsy  | Pelvis and perineum  | 256  | 10.1  |\n| Site of biopsy  | Multifocal  | 388  | 15.2  |\n| Site of biopsy  | Not specified  | 154  | 6.1  |\n|  | Total  | 2，547  | 100.0  |\n\n【17】ease， the speciality it presented to and the technique of biopsy. Benign proliferation， cysts and malignant neoplasms presented mostly to surgery specialities and were mainly excised. Also， inflammatory dermatoses showed up at the dermatologic clinic with punch biopsy as the preferred biopsy method.\n\n【18】One hundred and seventy-six  specific diseases enti-ties were diagnosed in the skin biopsies. Table 4 shows the 25most frequent pathologies seen in biopsies of black African skin. These 25 disease entities constituted 1790 (70.4%) of all diag-noses. The remaining 149 diseases accounted for 757 (28.5%) of the diagnoses.\n\n【19】Table 5 compares the most frequent pathologies diagnosed in skin biopsies submitted to the histopathology laboratory with the most frequent diagnoses in a dermatologic clinic as reported in another study .\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】This study analyzed all the skin biopsies， irrespective of source， received at the Pathology department of the University of Nige-ria Teaching Hospital (UNTH)， Enugu， over 19 years and at-tempted to describe their unique attributes histopathological profile. The Pathology department receives and processes all tissue biopsies done in the hospital， including skin biopsies from the dermatology department and cutaneous excision biopsies from other surgical departments. Our study produced some illu-minating insights about skin conditions in a developing tropical black African country. On the theme of demography， the age of patients who had skin biopsies ranged from 1.2 months to91 years， reiterating the profusely reported fact of skin disease being a problem for all age groups. In our study， 3.1the mean age(SD) of those who had skin biopsy was 38.5(19.1) years. This was much higher than the mean ages ranging from 23.5 to 29.5years reported in studies that examined the pattern of skin dis-ease in the dermatologic clinic setting . This much higher mean age for skin biopsies may suggest either clinicians are reluctant to subject younger people to an invasive proce-dure such as biopsy or that prevalent skin diseases of younger people do not often require biopsy in their management. The later scenario finds some support in Landis et al. ， which analyzed the prevalence of skin conditions stratified by age and observed variation of skin disease among age groups. In their study， actinic keratosis and neoplasms were the topmost diag-noses in age groups 45 years and above， while atopic dermatitis， acne and viral warts topped other diagnoses in younger people. The preponderance of females over males in skin biopsies also reflects a common finding in the epidemiology of skin disease as documented in several studies . Some other studies， however， report more males presenting with skin conditions than females .\n\n【22】In our study， there was a strong association between the type of skin disease， the departments they presented to and the type of biopsy employed in their evaluation， as shown in Table 3. Benign proliferation， cysts and malignant neoplasms were pre-sented mainly to surgery departments， and the preferred mode of biopsy was excision. Similarly， inflammatory dermatoses presented commonly at the dermatology department and were punch biopsies. Only 37% of the skin biopsies originated from a dermatology practice. The majority of the biopsies (62.5%) were from various surgery specialities， mostly excision biop-sies. This is quite instructive as it represents a departure from the pattern seen in some advanced health systems such as the United States of America， where the majority of the skin can-cers diagnosed annually are excised in dermatologists'offices. Our findings suggest that dermatologists in our hospital do less surgery than their counterparts in North America. In the United States， dermatology residency features training inmedical dermatology and dermatologic surgery . As a result， Cryosurgery， electrodesiccation， curettage and excision surgeries are among the repertoire of office-based procedures frequently done by dermatologists in the United States . As admitted by a practising dermatologist， dermatology residency training in Nigeria emphasize the medical aspect of the speciality with less exposure in dermatologic surgery， and this may explain the preponderance of skin biopsies from surgery specialities in our sample.\n\n【23】Table 3 Relationship between group of skin diseases， biopsy technique and attending department\n\n| Grouping of

A study  puts the proportion of late presenting cancers in Nigeria at over 70%. Thus most skin cancers at very advanced stages are most likely handled in better-equipped surgical theatres.\n\n【30】Epidemiologic data about skin diseases in Nigeria have mostly come from descriptive studies done in dermatologic clin-ics with few small community-based surveys . Our study discloses that considerable numbers of skin conditions emanate from other departments apart from the dermatologic clinic. This suggests that data derived from the dermatologic clinic alone would underestimate the hospital prevalence and incidence of skin diseases. An all-inclusive hospital-based epi-demiologic study of skin diseases should involve Pathology pae-diatrics， paediatric surgery， plastic surgery， orthopaedic surgery and general surgery specialities in addition to dermatology.\n\n【31】In our study， only 25 disease entities contributed 70.4% of all diagnoses， while 149 diseases accounted for the remaining 28.5%of diagnoses. As expected， the pattern of skin conditions， as seen in the Pathology laboratory， varied significantly with a presenta-tion in the dermatologic clinic. The topmost diagnosis in pathol-ogy laboratory included squamous cell carcinoma， epidermoid cyst， psoriasis， verruca， neurofibroma， lipoma， lichen planus， haemangioma， metastatic carcinoma and cutaneous lupus ery-thematosus， the picture being dominated entirely by tumorous masses， which require surgical excision for treatment， and der-matosis， which needs biopsy for evaluation. In contrast， the most frequent skin conditions in Nigerian dermatologic clinics， as documented in several studies， include tinea， acne， urticaria， atopic dermatitis， pityriasis versicolor， contact dermatitis， seb-orrheic dermatitis， vitiligo， lichen planus， and pityriasis rosea.\n\n【32】Skin diseases are among the most common health problems globally and are associated with considerable epidemiological， psychological and economic burdens. The 2013 global burden of disease report indicates that 15 dermatological conditions alone contributed 41.6 million DALYs (disability-adjusted life years) or 1.79% of the overall global burden of disease. Compared to157 diseases and injuries， skin and subcutaneous diseases were the 18th leading cause of global morbidity and mortality and4th leading cause of non-fatal burden of disease . Also， it was shown that in 2013， 85 million or 27% of Americans consulted a physician for at least 1 skin condition， that the direct health care cost of these consultations stood at $75 billion. That skin disease directly caused 22，953 deaths which translate to 0.9% of all deaths .\n\n【33】Conclusion\n\n【34】Our study documented 176 different histologic entities in black skin biopsies， and only 25 of these constituted over 70% of all diagnoses. Some skin conditions present to diverse specialities， and so hospital studies of the occurrence of skin conditions con-ducted only in dermatologic clinics underestimates the preva-", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "aaea660b-53ec-4ac9-8ae1-fb24e416515d", "title": null, "text": "【0】Background：\n\n【1】The diagnoses initially considered in cases with either a single or multiple mass in the hilus could be bronchial cancer， hamartoma or a metastatic tumor. Unilateral， single or nodular-shaped hilar amyloidosis is seldom observed.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】In a patient in whom amyloidosis cannot be detected by bronchoscopic examination， the diagnosis is achieved by anterior mediastinoscopy. Bronchial submucosa is greatly expanded by an amorphous pale eosinophilic material in the histopathological examination.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】Therefore， amyloidosis might be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients having calcified hilar mass radiologically. We report the findings on CT and MRI of pulmonary amyloidoma may be useful in the differantion from bronchogenic carcinomas and other Lumors.\n\n【6】Key words： Amyloidosis · hilar mass\n\n【7】Although bilateral hilar amyloidosis is more frequ-ently observed ， a single-sided hilar amyloidosis is seldom the case . Unilateral hilar amyloidosis occurs infrequently， and might can easily be confused with other tumors that are more commonly found in this region. Since it is rarely observed in patients with pulmonary symptoms， it is not generally considered in the differential diagnosis. There might be different types of thoracic amyloidosis such as tracheobronc-hial， nodular types or those showing diffuse involve-ment of the lung parenchyma or involvement of the lymph nodes . Those cases which emerge with bilateral hilar enlargement are usually the ones found together with pulmonary parenchymal amyloidosis. We present a rare case of unilateral hilar amyloidosis which was diagnosed via mediastinoscopy.\n\n【8】CASE REPORT\n\n【9】A 52-year-old woman complained of having a dry cough for about 35 years. Her past medical history was essentially negative and the patient’s physical examination and laboratory findings were conside-red normal.\n\n【10】Her P-A chest x-ray revealed a mass occupying the right hilus， which showed a double-contour and calcification . Computerized Tomography(CT) of the thorax demonstrated a soft tissue mass of 6.3x6.5x7.2 cm in size which contained extensive calcifications in the right middle mediastinum. There wasn’t any enhancement of the contrast material. Additionally， there was a calcified right paratracheal lymphadenopathy but no abnormality in the pulmo-nary parenchyma .\n\n【11】Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed a well-defined mass in the middle mediastinum that was slightly hyperintense compared to the muscle tissue on\n\n【12】T1 weighted images and heterogeneous hyperintens on T2 weighted images. There was no enhancement after Gd-contrast administration .\n\n【13】No endobronchial lesion could be observed at the bronchoscopic examination. Although malignancy was not considered with these findings， the patient was referred to the Department of Chest Surgery in order to obtain a biopsy. Mediastinoscopy was performed eventually and amyloidosis was diagnosed.\n\n【14】Initially cervical mediastinoscopy was performed under general anesthesia. At mediastinoscopy a lymph node biopsy was taken from the antecarinal region. From the frozen section it was reported to be an anthracotic lymph node. Mediastinotomy was then performed because of this and a 4 cm piece of right costachondrium was properly excised. After the mediastinal pleura was incised， a 3x3 cm hard fixed mass was observed at the hilus. An incisional biopsy was performed from this mass.\n\n【15】Nodular， well-circumscribed， acellular masses of amyloid were observed in the histopathologic sections of the biopsy specimen . Amyloid masses were deposited in the hilar lymphoid tissues and had A0TY replaced the lymphoid follicules. There was secondary calcification， ossification and histiocytic giant cell reac-tion aganist the masses of amyloid. Lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate was present in the tissue surrounding the amyloid deposits. Deposits of amyloid were stained pink or red with H&E， but stained metachromatically violet with crystal violet. When stained with Congo red they showed a characteristic apple-green birefringence under polarised light .\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n\n【17】Amyloid is an inert eosinophilic proteinaceous ma-terial that is deposited extracellulary in the body.\n\n【18】Intrathoracic amyloidosis is one of the least com-mon forms of amyloid diseases. The incidence of pulmonary involvement in primary amyloidosis has been reported to be between 50%-70% with nodal involvement occuring in approximately 29% of the cases 8J.\n\n【19】Amyloidosis can be primary or be secondary to vari-ous infectious， inflammatory， or malignant condi-tions. Primary amyloidosis (AL) is due to deposition of protein derived from immunoglobulin light chain fragments. It begins in the bone marrow and primarily affects heart， kidneys， tongue， nerves and intestines. Secondary amyloidosis (AA)： This form associated with chronic infectious or inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA)， osteomyelitis， tuberculosis， Hodgkin’s lymphoma， kidney cancer， leprosy， Chron’s disease， AIDS， lupus etc. Mostly affects kidneys， spleen， liver and lymph nodes. Other organs may be affected .\n\n【20】In developed countries， light chain amyloidosis (AL) is the most common type of systemic amyloidosis， while in developing countries another type called AA amyloidosis is more frequent. AA amyloidosis is rare， occurring in less than 1 percent of persons with chronic inflammatory diseases in the United States and Europe， but is more common in Turkey and the Middle East where it occurs in association with familial Mediterranean fever . Amyloidosis lokalized to the respiratory tract are AL in type . Our case has positive immiinohistochemical stain-ing for AL.\n\n【21】Histological confirmation of amyloid through Congo red staining producing red-green birefringence under cross-polarised light remains the diagnostic goldstan-dard. Most tissue specimens， ranging from needle biopsies to open surgical resections .\n\n【22】Primary amyloidosis can only be diagnosed after the secondary form has been excluded.\n\n【23】An endobronchial mass causing bronchial obstruction may be visible both in the primary and the secondary forms of the disease， or the lesion may be just inci-dentally detected at bronchoscopy. Only 30% of the symptomatic patients with primary amyloidosis can be related to pulmonary amyloidosis .\n\n【24】Amyloidosis may involve any portion of the respira-tory tract. Deposits in the tracheo-bronchial tree may cause signs of bronchial obstruction or hemorrage. Diffuse interstitial pulmonary amyloidosis may lead to dyspnea or pulmonary hemorrage. Pleural deposition may be associated with pleural effusion. Tracheo bronchial amyloid or nodular parenchymal amyloid deposition most often occur as localised pulmonary amyloidosis. Localised tracheo-bronchial amyloidosis is uncommon. The lesions may be single or multip-le and consist of submucosal plaques or tumor-like masses. They may cause symptoms such as chronic wheezing， dyspnea，cough， hemophytisis， atelectasis and chronic infection， like the lesions located within the airway lumen .\n\n【25】On bronchoscopic examination， the bronchial mu-cosa may reveal several areas of rigidity and appear pale. Ossification may occur in these areas in time， and may also be defined as ‘tracheobronchopatia osteoplastica’.\n\n【26】Nodular parenchymal amyloidosis is generally asymp-tomatic. It is described as the intrathoracic manifes-tation of the amyloid disease presenting with massive calcific lymph node enlargement and the pulmonary lesions characterised by aggregations of small nodu-les . Hilar amyloidosis cases with or without pri-mary parenchymal involvement have been reported. However， enlargement of hilar lymph nodes in the absence of pulmonary involvement is extremely rare. Hisui， et al.， have diagnosed an amyloidosis case which appeared as a unilateral hilar mass by performing a percutaneous needle aspiration biopsy . Such cases characterised by hilar mass can be generally diagnosed via thoraco-tomy or mediastinoscopy . There are cases which present with a mediastinal mass， either ac-companied by hilar lymphadenopathy radiologically or not .\n\n【27】Unilateral hilar amyloidosis of the mediastinum is an extremely rare contidion. However， there are incidental radiographic findings in asymptomatic individuals. It can easily be observed in the radio-logical examination but the appearance is not very typical.Radiographically amyloidosis may present as bilateral or unilateral hilar enlargement resembling a bronchial carcinoma， sarcoidosis， malignant lymp-homa or angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy. Tumor calcifications can be observed in the P-A chest roentgenogram . A similar view can be also observed in the CT of the thorax . In our case， we have detected a calcified hilar mass both in the P-A chest roentgenogram and in the CT of the thorax.\n\n【28】Matsumoto et al reported that the findings on CT and MRI of a proven pulmonary paranchymal amy-loidoma. They demostrated the low intensity of the le-sions on T2-weighted images may be useful in the dif-ferential diagnosis from bronchogenic carcinoma . To our knowledge， MRI views of primary mediastinal amyloidosis have not been reported previously in the literature. Thus， our case has a special importance from this point of view.\n\n【29】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【30】In conclusion we can say that amyloidosis should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of a cal-cified unilateral hilar mass. If amyloidosis cannot be diagnosed according to the bronchoscopic findings， the correct diagnosis may be achieved by appropriate surgical procedures.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

In this report， we describe the first case of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with EHPVO having underwent pure laparoscopic left hepatectomy with middle hepatic vein (MHV) resection.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 70-year-old woman with a diagnosis of mixed-type HCC or cholangiocarcinoma located in segment 4b was referred to our hospital， and computed tomography revealed EHPVO with cavernous transformation. We suc-cessfully performed pure laparoscopic left hepatectomy with MHV resection by using the individual hilar ap-proach， frequent intraoperative sonography and indocyanine green imaging. In this case， the routine Glissonian approach was impossible due to cavernous transformation growth and the absence of a portal vein. Therefore， frequent confirmation of intrahepatic flow was crucial to avoid intraoperative complications. The patient was discharged with no complications on postoperative day 7. A histopathological examination revealed that the moderately differentiated HCC formed a pseudoglandular pattern and cord-like structures， thereby defined as type ll according to Edmondson’s classification.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】Currently， difficulty scoring systems for laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) usually contain the procedure and location of the hepatic tumor， but they do not contain the variety of anatomical abnormality due to its rarity. However， the false recognition of hilar vessels and biliary ducts in patients with an anatomical abnormality， in-cluding EHPVO， leads to severe injury； therefore， anatomical variety and abnormality are also important fac-tors increasing the difficulty of LLR.\n\n【6】Keywords： Anatomic Variation · Carcinoma， Hepatocellular· Hepatectomy· Laparoscopy· Portal VeinExtrahepatic portal vein obstruction (EHPVO) is one of the most important diseases that causes pre-hepatic portal hy-pertension .Most cases of EHPVO are under 20 years old， and only 20% of EHPVO patients are diagnosed at ages over20 years old. In adult patients with EHPVO， hepatopetal col-lateral pathways rapidly develop with reconstitution of flow into intrahepatic portal branches； therefore， in adult EHPVO， an apparent causal disease cannot be clinically identified， and liver function abnormalities are not always accompanied by portal hypertension symptoms .\n\n【7】Laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) has dramatically advanced in recent years because of technological developments， ad-vances in preoperative assessments， and the publication of guidelines and consensus statements . In addition， the Southampton consensus guidelines for laparoscopic liver sur-gery has concisely clarified LLR indications and implementa-tion . However， LLR demands complex hepatobiliary and pan-creatic surgery experience and excellent surgical technique in the setting of anatomical variations or abnormalities in EHPVO. To date， there have been few reports of hepatocellular carcino-ma (HCC) in patients with EHPVO since 1987 ； furthermore， laparoscopic major hepatectomy for patients with EHPVO has never been reported before. Here， we report the first case of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with EHPVO in a patient who underwent laparoscopic left hepatectomy with middle hepat-ic vein (MHV) resection.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 70-year-old woman who was followed for nonalcoholic fat ty liver disease or hepatic steatosis received abdominal ultra-sonography， and a hepatic mass was detected in the left lobe. She was referred to our hospital for further investigation. Herbody mass index was 24.6 kg/m?， and she had no history of diabetes mellitus. A routine laboratory examination revealed only minor elevations in transaminases and tumor markers as follows： aspartate aminotransferase 31 U/L， alanine amino-transferase 31 U/L， platelet count 17.6×10/pL， carcinoembry-onic antigen 1.5 ng/mL， carbohydrate antigen 19-9 8.0 U/mL， o.-fetoprotein 9.5 ng/mL， and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonistll 58 mAU/mL， d-dimer 1.2 pg/mL，an-tithrombin-lII 86%. She had no infection history of hepatitis virus or alcohol abuse； therefore， common etiologies of HCC were excluded except for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.An ab-dominal ultrasonography examination revealed a hypoecho-ic mass with halos without intrahepatic bile duct dilatation.A dynamic enhanced computed tomography (CT) examination revealed a 5-cm， hypodense hepatic tumor in segment 4B that invaded the MHV . This tumor did not stain in arte-rial phase as do typical HCCs； however， ring enhancement of the tumor was not observed. The portal phase of the CT ex-amination also revealed cavernous transformation from the infrapancreatic superior mesenteric vein to the intrahepat-ic vessels； therefore， a complication of EHPVO was suspect-ed . No radiological signs of liver cirrhosis were observed on CT scan or abdominal ultrasound. Gadolinium-ethoxybenzy.-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid magnet-ic resonance imaging also revealed that the hepatic tumor seemed to be mixed-type HCC or cholangiocarcinoma from the contrast pattern . The tumor showed low in-tensity in the hepatobiliary phase， without dilatation of intra-hepatic bile ducts. The preoperative liver volumetry is shown in Figure 3. We could not find any signs of developing var-ices by esophagogastroduodenoscopy. We did not perform hemodynamic studies because she had no symptoms of por-tal hypertension. From this work-up， she was diagnosed with mixed-type HCC with EHPVO， and we performed laparoscopic left hepatectomy with MHV resection for this patient owing to the necessity of combined resection of the middle hepatic vein. During this operation， indocyanine green (ICG) imaging(PINPOINT； NOVADAQ Technologies， Canada) was used to vi-sualize the demarcation line and branches of hepatic ducts.\n\n【10】The patient was placed in the supine position， and we used a five-trocar technique for usual left-sided laparoscopic hep-atectomy . During hepatic parenchymal transec-tion， the upper limit of pneumoperitoneum pressure was set to 10-12 mmHg. The falciform and left triangular ligaments were transected and cholecystectomy was performed as usual.\n\n【11】Then， we confirmed the root of the middle and left hepatic veins ， and the ductus venosus was clipped and di-vided . Our usual laparoscopic hilar approach is the Glissonian approach； however， EHPVO with cavernous transfor-mation prevented us from dissecting the left Glissonian pedi-cle. Therefore， we used an individual approach in this case. We first identified the left hepatic artery， and it was then clipped and divided . A magnified view revealed that cav-ernous transformation consisted of some small vessels that delivered a hepatopetal flow； therefore， we carefully transect-ed them one by one， using intraoperative sonography to con-firm the intrahepatic blood flow in the right lobe . After transecting these small vessels， the demarcation linebetween the right and left lobes was revealed by ICG imag-ing . Intraoperatively， 2.5 mg of ICG was inject-ed into the vein to examine the perfusion area of the cys-tic vein. The demarcation of stained areas within the hepatic parenchyma was marked by electrocautery to determine the transecting line. Then， parenchymal transection was routine-ly performed along the demarcation line and the MHV， using Pringle's maneuver. We used intestinal clips for Pringle's ma-neuver because they do not obstruct the operating field， un-like a tourniquet. The superficial parenchyma was transect-ed by vessel sealer， and deep parenchyma was transected by clamp-crush technique. We used high-density monopolar sa-line-cooled radiofrequency device for hemostasis. The middle hepatic vein was exposed toward the inferior vena cava and divided at the site of tumor invasion . The root of the middle and left hepatic veins was transected using a lin-ear stapler . Finally， the left hepatic duct was vi-sualized by ICG imaging  and transected using a linear stapler. The resected specimen was obtained from an intraumbilical incision. Frequency and total time of Pringle’s maneuver were 6 times and 103 minutes and 54 seconds，re-spectively. The operating time was 285 minutes， and blood loss was 71 mL. A suction drain remained in place for 3 days， and on postoperative day 7， the patient was discharged with-out any complications. There were no postoperative compli-cations as of 90-day follow-up.\n\n【12】Macroscopic findings of the resected specimens showed that a capsulized tumor 38x26 mm in size was located at segment4 . The MHV was also observed grossly adjacent to the tumor， and tumor thrombosis was noted， with intraluminal coagulative necrosis . A magnified view also revealed that the moderately differentiated HCC formed a pseudoglan-dular pattern and cord-like structures ； therefore， this HCC was defined as type Il according to Edmondson’s clas-sification， and was defined as T4N0M0， stage IlIB according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer classification. The minimum surgical margin from the tumor was about 2mm， but there was no exposure of tumor cells. In Japan， no adjuvantchemotherapy is recommended after curative resection of HCC； therefore， the patient receives intensive follow-up with peri-otic CT examinations. Three months after the operation， the patient showed no signs of recurrence.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】EHPVO is usually recognized as one of the common causes of noncirrhotic portal hypertension . In adults， EHPVO is of-ten diagnosed while evaluating another disease， because some patients with EHPVO have no symptoms of portal hyperten-sion owing to the prompt development of cavernous transfor-mation. There are various speculated etiologies of EHPVO in adults， including trauma， sepsis due to cholangitis and infect-ed pancreatic necrosis caused by severe pancreatitis， umbil-ical vein catheterization， dehydration， myeloproliferative dis-order， coagulation defects， congenital anomalies of the portal vein， malignancy，and cirrhosis ； however， there was no clear history of any cause of EHPVO in this case.\n\n【15】The specific phenomenon of EHPVO is cavernous transfor-mation， which distributes to reduce portal pressure and sup-ply hepatopetal flow. However， the precise role of cavernous transformation is still unclear because there are some cases developing severe duodenal varices that bypass from the su-perior mesenteric vein to the inferior vena cava. In addition. EHPVO sometimes causes ectopic varices in the biliary tract； therefore， cavernous transformation does not always work to reduce portal pressure . Fortunately， there was no history of gastrointestinal bleeding in this case. It is crucial to con-firm these histories and findings because potential portal hy-pertension should be evaluated and treated preoperatively to reduce postoperative complications. With regards to post-operative management in EHPVO patients， frequent abdomi-nal sonography examinations are performed to evaluate hep-atopetal flow to the remnant liver， and we checked enhanced CT examination on postoperative day 7 to confirm the absence of any portal vein thrombi.\n\n【16】There is no clear evidence of tumorigenesis of EHPVO； there-fore， there have been few reports of hepatectomy in cases with EHPVO. To the best of our knowledge， our report is the first case of HCC with EHPVO having undergone laparoscopic left hepatectomy with MHV resection. LLR has rapidly developed worldwide， and hemihepatectomies in LLR are also routinely performed at high-volume centers . Some difficulty scor-ing systems have revealed that the procedure and tumor loca-tion are important factors for LLR . Our previous analy ses also revealed that body mass index and platelet count are also factors influencing LLR difficulty， in addition to the above2 factors . However， anatomical variations and abnormal-ities are not considered influencing factors due to their rarity and surgical risk because critical anatomical abnormalities and anomalies are very rare. For example，the most notable anom-aly of the portal vein is right umbilical portion； the umbilical portion exists between the right anterior and left medial sec-tion in this anomaly . Therefore， the usual Glissonian ap-proach consequently leads to complete portal vein clamping. To avoid incorrect transection of the hilar vessels， we used not the Glissonian approach but the individual approach for hilardissection， and ICG imaging was also a mandatory technique for such an unusual case . In the near future， advanc-es in real-time navigation systems will make LLR a more so phisticated procedure.\n\n【17】Conclusions\n\n【18】We herein report the first case of HCC with EHPVO having undergone laparoscopic left hepatectomy with MHV resec-tion. Currently， LLR with an anatomical abnormality， including EHPVO， is not routinely recommended because these cases have the potential risk of severe intraoperative complications. Only experienced LLR teams can employ various surgical tech-niques and tactful strategies for difficult LLRs. The individual approach for hilar dissection with intraoperative sonography and ICG imaging was crucial to transect the vessels of cavern-ous transformation， and LLRs have some advantages of mag-nified view， close dissection， and controlling intraoperative bleeding by pneumoperitoneum. We have demonstrated that LLR is feasible and safe in patients with EHPVO.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It is a synthetic imidazothiazole derivative which was previously used as an immunomodulating agent for treatment of various connective tissue disorders and colorectal carcinoma. However， it was withdrawn lat-er from the market due to significant toxicity associated with it.\n\n【2】Case Report： We present the case of a 59-year-old male patient with a history of active cocaine use who presented to the hospital with febrile neutropenia and agranulocytosis. He underwent extensive work-up for neutropenia and was suspected to have it secondary to levamisole-adulterated cocaine. He was treated with antibiotics and granulocyte-stimulating factor. His white cell count improved and he was discharged home. He continued to use cocaine after discharge from the hospital. He returned to the hospital 3 weeks later with recurrent neutro-penia and agranulocytosis complicated by septic shock and bowel necrosis which required prolonged antibiot-ics and a bowel resection.\n\n【3】Conclusions： Levamisole-induced agranulocytosis should be considered in patients who present with neutropenia and a his-tory of cocaine use. Physicians should have high clinical suspicion and consider it a potential etiology of agran-ulocytosis when other causes have been excluded.\n\n【4】MeSH Keywords： Agranulocytosis ·Cocaine· Febrile Neutropenia· Levamisole\n\n【5】Cocaine abuse remains a significant health problem in the United States. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health Data for the year 2014-2015， approximately 1.7million young adults ages 18 to 25 years old used cocaine in the past year (approximately 5% of the young adult popula-tion) . For cost-cutting and meeting demand， a number of adulterants are added to cocaine. Of them， the most common is levamisole. Levamisole is a synthetic imidazothiazole deriv-ative， which was initially introduced as an anthelmintic agent in 1966 . In the 1970s， it found widespread use as an im-munomodulating agent for the treatment of various connec-tive tissue disorders and colorectal carcinoma However， in 2000 it was withdrawn due to its toxicity. Levamisole is known to cause severe neutropenia and agranulocytosis . We present the case of a 59-year-old male patient with recur-rent neutropenia and agranulocytosis associated with levam-isole-adulterated cocaine.\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】A 59-year-old male patient presented to the hospital with a3-day history of fever and sore throat. He has a history of active cocaine use. On examination he was alert， oriented， febrile (tem-perature of 39.4℃)，tachycardic (heart rate of 115 beats/min)， and tachypneic (respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min)， with nor-mal blood pressure of 112/72 mmHg. Oropharyngeal exami-nation showed pharyngeal erythema without evidence of ton-sillar enlargement or exudates. Cardiopulmonary examination revealed normal S1 and S2 without any murmur and clear bi-lateral lung fields. Abdominal examination was unremarkable.\n\n【8】Initial lab work showed severe neutropenia with white blood cell (WBC) count of 0.6 cells/mm³ (4-11×10° cells/mm3) and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 24. Hemoglobin and plate-lets count were normal. Kidney and liver function were nor-mal. Urine toxicology screen obtained at the time admission was positive for cocaine. He was managed as a case of febrile neutropenia. Cultures were drawn and empiric antibiotics (ce-fepime) were started. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck showed tonsillar inflammation without any abscess or fluid collection. He was extensively worked up to identify a cause of neutropenia. Serum levels of vitamin B12 and folate were normal. Infectious workup for human immunodeficien-cy virus， hepatitis viruses， Epstein Barr virus， cytomegalovi-rus， and parvovirus B19 were negative. Immunological workup showed normal titers of antinuclear antibody (ANA) and an-tineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) and normal com-plement levels. Peripheral smear showed marked leukopenia. Given a history of cocaine use and a negative workup for com-mon causes of neutropenia， levamisole-induced agranulocytosiswas suspected. Treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was initiated. Over the course of the next few days his white count started improving and returned to nor-mal on the 7th day after admission. He recovered completely and was discharged home.\n\n【9】Three weeks later he presented again to the hospital with the complaints of diffuse abdominal pain， abdominal distension， and bloody diarrhea for the past 4 days. He had continued to use cocaine regularly， with occasional rectal administration of cocaine. On examination he was alert， oriented， afebrile， tachycardic (120 beats/min)， tachypneic (20 breaths/min)， and hypotensive (92/60 mmHg). Initial workup revealed se-vere neutropenia with WBC count of 0.4 cells/mm’and ANC of 16， lactic acidosis with a lactate of 5.6 mmol/L，and an an-ion gap of 23. Urine toxicology was positive for cocaine. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed increased bowel wall thick-ness involving the rectum， sigmoid， and descending colon as well as the caecum and appendix， with adjacent mesenter-ic fat stranding . He was suspected to be in sepsis. Blood cultures and stool studies were obtained. Fluids， pres-sor， and broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam) were started. He was also started on G-CSF for neutropenia. Flexible sigmoidoscopy showed diffuse edema involving the sigmoid colon and rectum， along with patchy severe ulceration concerning for bowel ischemia and necrosis. An exploratory laparotomy was performed， which re-vealed segments of necrotic bowel involving the sigmoid co-lon， rectum， and cecum. Sigmoid colectomy，ileocecectomy with end ileostomy， and descending mucus fistula were performed. Histopathological analysis of the resected bowel showed mu-cosal and transmural ulceration and necrosis consistent with ischemic changes . His blood cultures remained neg-ative and antibiotics were discontinued. His WBC count im-proved， with normalization on the 4th day after G-CSF thera-py. He was transferred to a nursing facility for long-term care.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Levamisole is a known adulterant of cocaine . As of July2009， the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) of the US Department of Justice isolated levamisole in up to 69% of co-caine coming to the United States . Easy availability， cheap cost， and similar appearance makes it a popular adulterant in cocaine. Also， levamisole is known to potentiate the eu-phoric effect of cocaine， which make is a suitable choice as an adulterant . Neutropenia and agranulocytosis are well-recognized adverse effects of levamisole. Agranulocytosis is seen clinically in 2.5% to 13% of patients using levamisole . The exact pathophysiology of levamisole-induced agranulo-cytosis is unknown， but an antibody mediated immune re-sponse causing the destruction of white blood cells has beensuspected . Autoantibodies such as antineutrophilic cy-toplasmic antibodies， antiphospholipid antibodies， and anti-nuclear antibodies have been reported to be associated with levamisole use . Also， studies have identified a great-er occurrence of levamisole-induced agranulocytosis with HLA B27 genotype， suggesting a genotypic susceptibility for devel-opment of this condition . In 2015， Buxton et al. per-formed a case-control study with 8 cases of cocaine-induced agranulocytosis and 26 matched controls， utilizing genotyp-ing assay and novel gene chip technique . They identified a significant association between HLA B27 genotype and co-caine-induced agranulocytosis. Genetic susceptibility with HLA B27 genotype also put these individuals at high risk for recur-rence if they continue to use cocaine.\n\n【12】Reports of agranulocytosis associated with levamisole-adul-terated cocaine use started to emerge in April 2008， when a clinical reference laboratory in New Mexico identified unex-plained cases of agranulocytosis confirmed by bone marrow bi-opsy . Following this， the New Mexico Department of Health did an investigation and identified 11 cases of agranulocytosisassociated with cocaine between April 2008 and November2009. In November 2008， Canadian health authorities in British Columbia and Alberta identified levamisole in drug samples of cocaine users with agranulocytosis. Also， between April2009 and November 2009， public health officials in Seattle， Washington identified 10 cases of agranulocytosis in cocaine users. Since then， a number of cases of agranulocytosis asso-ciated with levamisole-adulterated cocaine have been report-ed in the literature . Knowles et al. identified 42cases of confirmed and probable neutropenia associated with adulterated cocaine in Alberta and British Columbia， Canada from January 2008 to March 2009. Although cocaine-induced neutropenia is not rare， its nonspecific presentation makes it a diagnostic challenge.\n\n【13】Neutropenia is defined as absolute neutrophil count less than1500 cells/microliter. Agranulocytosis literally means absence of granulocytes and is used to indicate severity of neutropenia(absolute neutrophil count of less than 500 cells/microliter). Neutropenia and agranulocytosis can have a wide variety of etiologies， the most common being drug-induced neutropenia.\n\n【14】Other causes include nutritional deficiencies， autoimmune and collagen vascular diseases， congenital and inherited syn-dromes， infections， and malignancies. In some cases， an incit-ing event cannot be identified， and these are idiopathic cas-es. Levamisole-induced neutropenia is a diagnosis of exclusion and is considered once other causes of neutropenia have been ruled out in a patient with a history of cocaine use. Exposure to levamisole can be tested in urine by a gas chromatogra-phy method but the utility of this assay is limited due to the shorter half-life of levamisole (only 5-6 h) . Levamisole-induced neutropenia is reversible upon discontinuation of the drug. However， recurrence of neutropenia and agranulocytosis is common upon re-exposure to levamisole， as seen in our pa-tient， who continued to use adulterated cocaine after his ini-tial hospital discharge and presented again with severe neu-tropenia and a more complex condition.\n\n【15】The recurrence of agranulocytosis was complicated by colitis and bowel necrosis in our patient. Individuals who are exposed to levamisole-adulterated cocaine have a number of risk factors and likely etiologies for colitis and bowel necrosis. Neutropenic enterocolitis is a life-threatening condition， which can occur in patients who are neutropenic and have gut mucosal break-down due to cytotoxic chemotherapy . This may be com-plicated by superimposed bacterial and/or fungal infections， often infiltrating the bowe! wall. Levamisole is known to cause characteristic vasculitis syndrome and immunological abnor-malities with production of autoantibodies . The vasculitissyndrome can involve mesenteric vessels， leading to ischemia and necrosis of the bowel wall. Lastly， cocaine itself has been reported to cause intestinal colitis by producing intense vaso-constriction of mesenteric vessels， leading to reduced blood flow and ischemia . Also， cocaine exerts direct toxic effects on gut mucosa. Considering the high-risk behavior of rectally administering cocaine in our patient and taking into account the histopathological findings of mucosal and transmural ul-ceration with necrosis without evidence of vascu litis or infec-tion， we believe the most likely etiology of colitis and bowel necrosis in our patient was cocaine-induced ischemic colitis. Management of levamisole-induced neutropenia is supportive， in addition to discontinuation of the drug and treatment of as-sociated complications. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor(G-CSF) has been shown to hasten white count recovery and can be a treatment option in these patients.\n\n【16】Conclusions\n\n【17】Levamisole-induced agranulocytosis should be considered in patients who present with neutropenia and cocaine use. Clinicians should be aware of this entity to perform early se-rum and urine levamisole testing for confirmation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

He was diagnosed with compartment syndrome and rhabdomyolysis. His management included emergent fluid resuscitation， fasciotomies， debride-ment of necrotic muscle from his anterior compartment， and delayed primary closure. After six months of in-tensive outpatient physical therapy including the use of blood flow restriction treatments， the patient returned to sports and received a NCAA Division 1 Football scholarship.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】We describe the details of this patient's case and review the literature related to acute exertional compartment syndrome. The occurrence of acute compartment syndrome in the absence of trauma or fracture，though rare， can have devastating consequences following delays in treatment. AECS requires prompt diagnosis and surgi-cal intervention to prevent these consequences. Diagnosis of atraumatic cases can be difficult， which is why awareness is equally as important as history and physical examination. While diagnosis is primarily clinical， it can be supported with direct intra-compartmental pressure measurements and maintaining a high index of suspicion in acute presentations of exertional limb pain.\n\n【5】MeSH Keywords： Anterior Compartment Syndrome· Athletic Injuries · Compartment Syndromes ·Leg Injuries·NecrosisAcute exertional compartment syndrome (AECS) is character-ized by a rise in pressure within a closed fascial space in the absence of a specific traumatic event . This rise in pres-sure can override capillary perfusion pressure leading to a re-duction in myocyte oxygenation and ultimately resulting in myonecrosis and neurologic damage . In comparison to chronic exertional compartment syndrome， which is relative-ly benign and typically a self-limiting condition， AECS is a sur-gical emergency. Many clinicians are aware of the potential for acute compartment syndrome (ACS) in the setting of frac-tures， vascular injury， or significant non-fracture extremity trau-ma. However， there is limited awareness to the risk of ACS in a non-fracture， non-traumatic presentation. Due to its rarity and atypical presentation， the diagnosis is often delayed . Without prompt treatment with fasciotomy， AECS can lead to muscle necrosis and neurovascular injury . Therefore， it is critical for clinicians to maintain a high index of suspicion for AECS in patients with acute presentations of non-fracture， atraumatic limb pain.\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】A 17-year-old healthy African American male high school foot-ball player presented to the emergency department (ED) with the subacute onset of right leg pain and the inability to dorsi-flex his foot. His past medical history was unremarkable. In the week preceding his presentation， he had attended an off-sea-son football training camp. The day prior to his presentation， the patient developed relatively mild anterior leg pain after a strenuous workout but went to bed that evening thinking it was typical post-exercise muscle soreness. He woke the next morning with worsening pain in the anterior leg and the in-ability to dorsiflex his right foot. He denied any constitution-al symptoms such as fevers， chills， sweats， or other musculo-skeletal complaints.\n\n【8】On physical examination， he had a swollen and tense antero-lateral leg， pain with passive dorsiflexion and plantarflexion stretch， inability to dorsiflex the right foot， decreased (4/5) great and lesser toe extension， and decreased sensation to touch over the deep peroneal nerve distribution in the first web space. He maintained normal sensation to the remainder of the foot and ankle. He denied any posterior leg pain and had 5/5 plantar flexion and toe flexion strength. Compartment measurements were performed using an Intra-Compartmental Pressure Monitor (Stryker， Kalamazoo，MI， USA). The anterior compartment pressure measured 54 mm Hg with all others less than 25 mm Hg. Labs demonstrated a creatinine kinase (CK) of 19，011 U/mL (reference range 24-170 U/mL)， AST 293 U/L(reference range 5-40 U/L)， and ALT 112 U/L (reference range4-41 U/L). Radiographs of the leg and ankle were negative for any abnormalities. Subsequent tests during his admission for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase， sickle cell disease， and hemoglobin electrophoresis were all negative. Serum electro-lytes and electrocardiogram were normal.\n\n【9】The patient was diagnosed with acute exertional compart-ment syndrome of the anterior compartment of the right leg with rhabdomyolysis\n\n【10】Treatment\n\n【11】The Internal Medicine Service was consulted for management of his rhabdomyolysis. The patient received intravenous fluid resuscitation with a total of 4 L of isotonic crystalloid (0.9% nor-mal saline) during his time in the ED and was then placed on a maintenance fluid rate of 300 mL/hour. He was taken to the operating room for emergent anterior and lateral compartment fasciotomies six hours after his presentation to the ED and ap-proximately 24 hours after the onset of his initial symptoms.\n\n【12】Surgical technique\n\n【13】Once in the operating theater， general anesthesia was induced. The right leg was prepped and draped in standard fashion and a final timeout was performed. To avoid any additional isch-emia， no tourniquet was utilized during the procedure. Due to his clinical presentation and isolated elevated pressures within the anterior compartment， only the anterior and lateral com-partments were released. The deep and superficial posterior compartments were not entered. An extensive longitudinal in-cision was made midway between the anterior crest of the tib-ia and the fibula. The superficial peroneal nerve was identi-fied as it pierced the fascia to become subcutaneous and was protected throughout the procedure. A transverse incision was made over the lateral inter-muscular septum and the anterior and lateral compartments were released in their entirety. The anterior compartment demonstrated significant tension with bulging of the muscles upon fascial release. The muscles with-in the proximal anterior compartment were dark brown to grey in color and minimally contractile compared to the lateral com-partment muscles which were pink， healthy， and readily con-tractile to stimulation and electro-cautery. There was no evi-dence of any focal traumatic injury or hematoma formation. To avoid unnecessary debridement and allow for maximum po-tential muscle recovery， no muscle was debrided at the index procedure. The incision was left open and a negative pressure wound dressing (V.A.C.， KCI Medical) was applied. The patient underwent two additional irrigation and debridement proce-dures at 48-hourintervals (post-operative day 2 and day 4) with serial debridement of necrotic muscle in the anterior compart-ment. Delayed primary closure was performed at the fourth operation， six days after his initial presentation. Overall， thepatient lost approximate ly 80% of his tibialis anterior muscle and 50% of his extensor hallucis longs (EHL) muscle belly. His extensor digitorum longus and peroneus tertius required only minimal debridement. The lateral compartment muscles re-mained healthy throughout his treatment course.\n\n【14】His rhabdomyolysis improved over the course of the hospital-ization through intensive l fluid resuscitation with normal sa-line administered at a rate of 300 mL/hour. This rate of infu-sion was maintained until the serum CK was below 3，000 U/mL at which point fluid maintenance was discontinued on the fifth hospital day. Urine output remained adequate through-out his hospital course and there was no laboratory evidence of acute kidney injury. His BUN and creatinine at presenta-tion were 11.7 mg/dl and 1.3 mg/dL， respectively. Within 24hours of hospitalization， his creatinine improved to less than1.0 mg/dL (reference range 0.67-1.17 mg/dL).\n\n【15】Rehabilitation\n\n【16】The patient was discharged home in a Controlled Ankle Motion(CAM) boot so that he could begin early weight bearing and range of motion exercises. Outpatient physical therapy began two days after discharge. Initial therapy focused on dorsiflex-ion stretching to prevent the development of equinus contrac-ture， and core and lower extremity strengthening. His sutures were removed at two weeks and he was converted to an Ankle Foot Orthosis (AFO) to maintain neutral dorsiflexion due to his persistent foot drop. The patient’s rehabilitation process in-cluded 3-5 sessions of formal physical therapy per week for four months. These sessions included the routine use of blood flow restriction training at the Center for the Intrepid at San Antonio Military Medical Center. Blood flow restriction training is a form of exercise that utilizes brief and intermittent peri-ods of partially restricted venous blood flow during low load resistance training to improve muscular strength and endur-ance. These loads are typically 20-30% of a patient's single repetition maximum . Over the course of four months， thepatient gradually regained tibialis anterior function with dorsi-flexion strength improving from 0/5 to 4/5 at his most recent follow-up. Upon discharge from therapy， he continued to lack EHL strength (0/5) for which he preferred the use of a toe ex-tension strap to maintain great toe interphalangeal joint ex-tension. He declined any surgical procedures to correct his toe drop (tendon transfer versus interphalangeal joint fusion). He maintained normal lesser toe extension. Six months after his initial presentation， he had 15 degrees of active ankle dorsi-flexion and near normal sensation in the deep peroneal nerve distribution. His only complaint upon discharge was the inabil-ity to actively extend his great toe. He returned to play foot-ball at a very high level and accepted a scholarship offer to play Division 1 Football in college. Refer to Figure 1 for a visu-al timeline of our patient's rehabilitation.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】The differential diagnosis for atraumatic leg pain in an athlete include medial tibial stress syndrome (MTS)， chronic exertion-al compartment syndrome， tibial stress fractures， tendon pa-thology (including tendonitis， tendinosis， and rupture)， nerve entrapment， and popliteal artery entrapment. While AECS is rare， it may lead to severe and devastating consequences in a matter of hours if left untreated . The ability for a cli-nician to promptly diagnose and initiate treatment for AECS is crucial for the prevention of such consequences. We admit there was a delay in diagnosis with our patient due to both a delay in presentation as well as the failure to immediately recognize the compartment syndrome.\n\n【19】AECS was first described in 1943 by P.R. Vogt and since that time approximately 40 cases of true exertional ACS have been reported . ACS has been reported after heavy exer-cise， military training， a variety of endurance sports， and even after brief exercise . In 2004， Hope et al. compiled a re-view of 38 non-fracture ACS and compared these to 113 casesof ACS with fracture . They found that patients with non-fracture ACS were likely to experience up to eight hours in delay for fasciotomy when compared to fracture-related ACS.\n\n【20】In 2015， Livingston et al. reviewed 39 cases of pediatric non-fracture ACS and found that the presence of neurological deficits occurred 33% of the time  as compared to 20%in patients with tibia fracture-related ACS as reported by Shore et al. In one study， 50% of the non-fracture ACS group demonstrated motor weakness at initial presentation， and 63% presented with paresthesia . Livingston et al. dem-onstrated that the incidence of myonecrosis in non-fracture ACS (54%) was significantly higher than fracture-related ACS(4%) . Non-fracture ACS patients also had a lower rate of return to full activity (56%) compared to fracture-related ACS . Risk factors associated with non-fracture ACS include vascular abnormalities， thrombi， blood dyscrasias， anticoagula-tion use， infection， soft tissue injury， illicit drug use， and meta-bolic conditions predisposing to myonecrosis .\n\n【21】In 2016， Livingston et al. reported the largest case series of ex-ertional ACS describing seven cases of AECS in athletes with a mean age of 17 . The average time to decompressive fas-ciotomy in the AECS group compared to a fracture-ACS group was nearly five times longer (97 hours versus 19 hours， re-spectively， with a wide range from 19 hours to 336 hours). Much of the delay was attributed to delayed presentation and incorrect initial diagnosis. Patients who were diagnosed within 24 hours had no evidence of long-term complications. For reference， our patient presented to the ED approximate-ly 18 hours after symptom onset and underwent surgical de-compression within 24 hours. Each of the seven cases in the Livingston et al. series had anterior and lateral compartment releases and only one required a four-compartment release.\n\n【22】After a thorough review of the literature and all information available related to our patient， we feel he most likely devel-oped isolated rhabdomyolysis in the anterior compartment of his right leg. This local muscle injury resulted in focal edema increasing intra-compartmental pressure eventually leading to compartment syndrome. Rhabdomyolysis is the process of cell death leading to spillage of intracellular contents . Further consequences of rhabdomyolysis can include electro-lyte imbalances and cardiac rhythm abnormalities. As are-sult， close monitoring of kidney function， urinalysis， electro-lytes， and electrocardiogram changes is warranted while CK remains elevated. There have been two reported outbreaks of rhabdomyolysis at NCAA Division 1 Football programs in recent years. Thirteen players at the University of lowa were treated for rhabdomyolysis in 2011 during off-season work-outs. There were no reports of compartment syndrome in any of these players . Bhalla and Dick-Perez reported the case of a young athlete developing rhabdomyolysis and bilateralthigh compartment syndrome. Unfortunately， this patient de-veloped renal failure requiring dialysis .\n\n【23】ACS is a clinical diagnosis often supplemented using intra-compartmental pressure (ICP) measurements . Clinically， the classic presentation is unrelenting pain that is not relieved by rest. Pain is often said to be out of proportion to examination. These symptoms are distinctly different from those of MTS， chronic exertional compartment syndrome， and stress fracture， which tend to improve after a brief period of rest . Although our patient presented with pain， it was relatively mild (5/10 pain score and he was capable of unassist-ed ambulation) when compared to other acute compartment syndromes encountered by the senior author. His chief com-plaint upon presentation was the inability to dorsiflex his foot with pain as a secondary issue. Clinicians may be familiar with the six P's of compartment syndrome： pain， pallor， pulseless， paralysis， paresthesia， and poikilothermia. The most common presenting symptoms are pain and paresthesia . Pulselessness， paralysis， pallor， and poiklothermia are often late findings . Patients typically have pain to passive stretch of the affected muscle(s)， and the extremity may be swollen， or the compartments feel tense to palpation . In exertion-al ACS， pain and swelling may be the only presenting symp-toms . Ulmer et al. found a low sensitivity (13% to 19%) but high specificity (97%) for clinical diagnosis of ACS suggesting the importance of maintaining a low threshold for further work-up . In the setting of acute fracture， ICP measurements are at their peak when measured within 5 cm of the fracture site. In non-fracture ACS， the clinician must identify the compart-ment suspected of increased ICP and maintain a low threshold for evaluating multiple compartments . When measuring ICP， a delta pressure <30 mm Hg between diastolic blood pres-sure and ICP should be considered abnormal . Intervention for AECS follows the same principles as fracture-related ACS with emergent fasciotomy of all involved compartments \n\n【24】Conclusions\n\n【25】The occurrence of ACS in the absence of trauma or fracture， though rare， can have devastating consequences following de-lays in treatment. Similar to facture-related ACS， AECS requires prompt diagnosis and surgical intervention to prevent these con-sequences.Diagnosis of atraumatic cases can be difficult， which is why awareness is equally as important as history and physical examination. While diagnosis is primarily clinical， it can be sup-ported with direct ICP measurements and maintaining a high in-dex of suspicion in acute presentations of exertional limb pain.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

She started chemotherapy following the IC-BFM ALL2002 protocol with simultaneous calcitonin， diuretics and aggressive hydration for hypercalcemia， and went into complete remission after the in-duction therapy. After 4 months of chemotherapy， she was diagnosed with relapse associated again with ma-lignant hypercalcemia， and underwent chemotherapy with the relapse protocol. There was no response after the first 2 cycles， so we decided to start her on clofarabine. Due to the severe hypercalcemia and consecutive osteolysis， she developed several bone fractures and needed gypsum immobilization. We started her again on calcitonin， but she developed severe adverse reactions， so we found it necessary to start bisphosphonates， first zoledronic acid intravenously， and afterwards clodronate orally. Consolidation of bone fractures was achieved， but due to prolonged immobilization she developed bedsores， superinfected with Lichtheimia corymbifera. We started posaconazole orally， but she rapidly went into severe sepsis with multiple organ failure. The leuke-mia showed no response to chemotherapy， progressed rapidly and the patient died.\n\n【3】Conclusions： Malignant hypercalcemia is associated with a poor prognosis in leukemia， and might need a more aggressive therapy.\n\n【4】MeSH Keywords： Child·Hypercalcemia · Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-LymphomaMalignant hypercalcemia is a rare finding in the pediatric pop-ulation， the overall incidence being at 0.4-1.3%. Most often it is described in solid tumors， such as Ewing's sarcoma， neu-roblastoma， rhabdomyosarcoma， non-Hodgkin lymphoma，and in rare situations associated to acute leukemia or chronic my-eloid leukemia， mostly in the accelerated or blast phases . The mechanism is most likely humoral and dependent on the parathormone-related protein (PTHrP) . The clinical man-ifestations vary according to the values of hypercalcemia， and can lead to life-threatening symptoms.Most commonly， patients present with nausea， vomiting， and constipation， but high lev-els can also present with arrhythmias and renal failure. Early management of hypercalcemia starts with aggressive hydra-tion， forced diuresis with furosemide， and calcitonin respec-tively . If necessary， therapy with bisphosphonates， such as zoledronic acid， pamidronate， or clodronate， is another option. Dialysis can be instituted if there is no response to medical treatment， or in life-threatening situations . Denosumab， a monoclonal antibody， can be used in refractory disease .\n\n【5】We present the case of a 6-year-old female patient diagnosed and treated in our clinic for acute lymphoblastic leukemia with secondary malignant hypercalcemia.\n\n【6】Case Report\n\n【7】Our 6-year-old patient was first diagnosed in August 2016when she came with malaise， abdominal pain， vomiting， and bloody diarrhea. Clinical examination， peripheral hematologi-cal tests， bone marrow aspirate， and immunophenotyping con-firmed the diagnosis of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia with paraneoplastic hypercalcemia . The ini-tial level of calcium was at 14.9 mg/dL， with signs of tumorlysis syndrome， with high uric acid (9.9 mg/dL) and renal fail-ure (BUN 66 mg/dL and creatinine 1.01 mg/dL). We as well determined the values of PTH and 1，25-OH-vitamin D， which were both decreased.\n\n【8】Intensive chemotherapy was started according to the IC-BFM ALL 2002. Concurrently we administered calcitonin intra-muscularly (4 UI/kg every 12 hours)， abundant hydration(3.000 mL/m²) and furosemide starting with 1 mg/kg/day， and then up to 3 mg/kg/day. Calcium levels started to decrease， and the patient went into complete remission after the in-duction therapy.\n\n【9】After 4 months， during the consolidation therapy， the patient presented again with malaise， vomiting， diarrhea， and high cal-cium levels. Very early relapse was diagnosed by bone marrow aspirate and immunophenotyping and we started intensive chemotherapy according to the IC-BFM ALL 2002 REZ . Calcium levels were high， but this time the patient did not experience tumor lysis syndrome with renal failure .\n\n【10】Table 2.

The patient developed， due to severe osteolytic lesions， a spontaneous bone fracture of the left femur， so we found it necessary to start bisphos-phonates. The patient received an intravenous dose of 2 mg zoledronic acid， developing thereafter moderate hypocalcemia with the need of calcium supplementation for approximately10 days . After the stabilization of calcium levels， we switched to clodronate orally. Unfortunately， she experienced another bone fracture of the contralateral leg and needed a pel-vipedios gypsum immobilization . After 8 weeks of gypsum immobilization association with clodronate， consoli-dation of bone fractures was achieved.\n\n【14】The patient didn't respond to induction chemotherapy， after the first 2 blocks， we declared progressive disease， so third-line therapy with clofarabine was started.\n\n【15】Due to severe pancytopenia， gypsum， and prolonged immobi-lization she developed bedsores， which evolved into necrosis. Cultures were collected and infection with Lichtheimia cor-ymbifera was diagnosed. We decided to start treatment with posaconazole orally， but unfortunately， the patient developed severe sepsis， with multiple organ failure.\n\n【16】At the same time， her leukemia showed no response to che-motherapy with clofarabine and the patient died with pro-gressive disease.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】Malignant hypercalcemia is very rare in children， and has been described mostly in solid tumors and lymphomas. The patho-genesis describes a humoral pattern dependent on the PTHrP. There are 3 different known mechanism， from which the hu-moral pattern is the most common one， where both the PTH and the 1.25-0H vitamin D levels are low and the PTHrP level is high . The other 2 mechanisms， the direct invasion of the bone and the 1，250H-D mediated one， are characterized by low PTHrP level and low PTH level. The level of 1，250H-D is only high in the pattern it mediates . Being unable to determine the level of PTHrP， we only assumed that our case had the humoral pattern， being characterized by both low PTH and 1，250H-D levels.\n\n【19】Studies have underlined the association of malignant hyper-calcemia with a B-precursor phenotype leukemia with aberrant expression of CD13 and CD33， a leucocyte count of less than20 000/mm’ at diagnosis， with the hypercalcemia being pres-ent as well at the time of diagnosis as at the time of relapse. All these were confirmed in our case， as well .\n\n【20】There are some published case reports that link the malig-nant hypercalcemia to the translocation (17；19) . The t(17；19) (q22；p13) translocation generates the E2A-HLF chime-ric transcription factor and is associated with a high risk of re-lapse and poor prognosis， with an event-free survival (EFS) at5 years of 0% . This was confirmed also in our case， as the patient had a very early relapse and the leukemia was refractory even to third-line therapy with clofarabine， leading to the death of the patient.\n\n【21】Treatment of paraneoplastic hypercalcemia depends on the level of calcemia. With only low hypercalcemia protocols recommending the use of calcitonin， diuretics such as furose-mide， concomitantly with aggressive hydration. In cases with high levels of calcemia， or a poor response to the first-line treatment， and nonetheless in life-threatening situations， the use of bisphosphonates is recommended. Bisphosphonates are rarely used in children， because of their early and late potential side-effects. However， pamidronate has been shown to be effi-cient with few side-effects in adults with malignant hypercal-cemia . Studies have shown that hypercalcemia decreases faster if bisphosphonates are used . Little is known about the correct dosage， but there are some suggestions re-garding its administration. Doses range from 0.025 mg/kg to 0.05 mg/kg， and as well-fixed doses of 4 mg of zoledronic acid ， and a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg， with a maximum of 60 mg of pamidronate . We decided to administer only2 mg of zoledronic acid. Even with a smaller amount， the pa-tient still developed hypocalcemia and needed calcium sup-plementation for more than 1 week. We did not experience any cardiac side-effects. Even though we continued to admin-ister clodronate orally after the calcium levels stabilized， the patient still suffered another bone fracture.\n\n【22】Another particularity of our case was the infectious complica-tion with Lichtheimia corimbyfera， a fungus known to infect im-munosuppressed patients. It most commonly affects the cen-tral nervous system (CNS)， but in some particular situations can also infect traumatized skin . In our case， due to her severe pancytopenia secondary to intensive chemotherapy， and the immobilization with pelvipedios gypsum， the patient devel-oped bedsores underneath the gypsum. We started local and systemic treatment with antibiotic and antifungals ointments， a broad-spectrum antibiotic， and voriconazole， respectively. The evolution of bedsores was poor with the development of ne-crosis. Literature studies suggest that the best treatment op-tion for this fungus type is amphotericin B， but this product is not available in our country. Therefore， we decided to start oral posaconazole .\n\n【23】Conclusions\n\n【24】Malignant hypercalcemia may offer， in acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children， a poor prognosis， as was shown in our case report. The limitation of our case report was the lack of possibility to determine the translocation， both due to the ab-sence of a specialized laboratory at the time of diagnosis， and the impossibility to draw enough bone marrow blood at the relapse， because of high fragility of the bone.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Common clinical features in clude purpuric rash， predominantly on the lower extremities. Rarely， extracutaneous manifestations such as low-grade fe ver， malaise， weight loss， myalgias， and arthralgias can devel-op. Symptoms spontaneously improve in most cases. In severe or prolonged cases， treatment with steroids and steroid-spar-ing agents should be considered .\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】This is a 37-year-old woman with no significant past medical history presented with a chief concern of a full-body rash， which started on the medial aspect of her thighs bilaterally 2 weeks prior to presentation. The rash initially presented as small pete-chiae， which subsequently enlarged and spread down the trunk and the upper and lower extremities . Some lesions were coalescing and developed ulcerated blisters. The day after the rash appeared， she presented to an urgent care clinic due to associated sore throat and subjective fever. She tested positive for group A Streptococcus and was prescribed an oral course of amoxicillin-clavulanate 875-125 mg as well as prednisone 40 mg daily. She was compliant with this regimen， without improve-ment of her rash. An outpatient skin biopsy was performed just before the admission， which revealed findings concerning for early leukocytoclastic vasculitis， but no direct immunofluores-cence was performed. Home medications included diphenhydr-amine，cetirizine， ibuprofen， and prednisolone. A physical exam was remarkable for diffuse palpable rash on the trunk and on the upper and lower extremities. Laboratory tests results were notable for neutrophilic leukocytosis up to 21.9 bil/L with a left shift， reticulocytosis with a normal hemoglobin，thrombo-cytosis，elevated ESR， and CRP. Test results for Hl， hepatitis B， hepatitis C， MPO-ANCA， PR3-ANCA， ANA， DNA-ASE B， cryoglob-ulin，and streptolysin O antibodies were negative. Serum levels of complement C3 and C4 were normal. Ferritin and iron stud-ies were within normal limits. Folate and B12 were both low but MCV was normal. No evidence of hemolysis was found on blood smear； schistocytes review， LDH， and haptoglobin were not consistent with hemolysis. IgG，IgA， and IgM were all with-in normal limits. Urinalysis was normal. She was initially start-ed on vancomycin due to concern for bullous impetigo； howev-er， vancomycin was subsequently discontinued， and clindamycin was started. She was also started on intravenous steroids， fol-lowed by transition to oral prednisone. IgA vasculitis and leu-kocytoclastic vasculitis were suspected. Biopsy results were re-ceived 1 week later and did not reveal definitive findings of an acute leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Staining with antibodies to hu-man IgG， IgA， IgM， C3， fibrinogen， and albumin was negative.\n\n【7】The patient improved clinically and was discharged on clindamy-cin and prednisone taper. She was also started on folate and vitamin B12 supplementation. The patient was recommend-ed to follow up in a clinic and monitor for any signs of rash progression.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Cutaneous vasculitis is an inflammation of the small dermal blood vessel walls without systemic vasculitis or glomerulo-nephritis . Since the vasculitis usually involves small super-ficial vessels， urticaria， plaques， papules，and palpable purpu-ra are commonly seen. In addition， inflammation can spread to the vessels of the dermo-hypodermic junction and may re-sult in ulcers， nodules， or livedo. To investigate the type of in-flammatory infiltrate and establish the final diagnosis， a skin biopsy should be performed. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a common manifestation of other vasculitides presenting with similar skin lesions .\n\n【10】Cutaneous lesions can develop in many systemic small ves-sel vasculitides such as cryoglobulinemic vasculitis， Henoch-Schonlein purpura (IgA vasculitis)， antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis， and infectious endocarditis. Therefore， it is reasonable to regard leukocytoclastic vasculi-tis as an “umbrella term\" for many diseases.\n\n【11】Medications such as penicillins， cephalosporins，sulfonamides， phenytoin， biological agents， particularly the anti-TNF-omol-ecules ， and allopurinol may act as haptens and stimulate an immune response triggering the development of vasculi-tis. Cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis may also develop in the settings of infections such as hepatitis B or C， HIV， infective endocarditis， and infected shuts .\n\n【12】During evaluation of a case suspicious for vasculitis skin le-sions， comprehensive history and physical examination areimportant to determine whether the disease is limited to the skin. Complete blood count， complete metabolic panel， urinal-ysis， blood cultures， and immunologic screening (antineutro phil cytoplasmic antibodies， levels of the complement compo-nents C3 and C4， anti-nuclear antibodies， extractable nuclear antigens panel，cryoglobulins， anti-C1-q antibodies， testing for hepatitis B and C) must be ordered due to a very broad dif-ferential diagnosis. Imaging studies depend on the individual patient's presentation . Cutaneous biopsy from the newest lesion and direct immunofluorescence testing are conducted to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【13】In our case， the patient developed purpura and tense bullae on her extremities and lower trunk， but no rash was present on the upper trunk and face. In addition， there was a document-ed history of amoxicillin-clavulanate use secondary to group A streptococcal pharyngitis as well as regular intake of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The patient did not have any systemic symptoms such as fever， hematuria， abdominal pain， or diarrhea； therefore， the disease most likely was lim-ited to the skin.\n\n【14】Initial treatment of leukocytoclastic vasculitis includes dis-continuation of possible offending medications (non-steroi-dal anti-inflammatory drugs in our case). If cutaneous mani-festations are severe， the patient can be started on steroids， immunosuppressants， or rituximab based on the severity ofpresentation. In our case， we treated the patient only with ste-roids. Therapeutic plasma-exchange is performed in complicat-ed cases. In some cases， when the lesions are limited to the skin， only symptomatic treatment is needed .\n\n【15】Conclusions\n\n【16】Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a small-vessel vasculitis associat-ed with infections， autoimmune disorders， and certain drugs； however， it may also be idiopathic. Common manifestations include cutaneous lesions， and biopsy is required to establish a final diagnosis.

A case is presented of pulmo nary histoplasmosis presenting with nonspecific symptoms and hypercalcemia in the setting of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Few cases have previously been reported of pulmonary histo-plasmosis in patients following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation .\n\n【2】Case Report\n\n【3】A 75-year-old man with a history of acute myeloid leukemia(AML)， and resolved hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B vi-rus (HBV) infection received induction chemotherapy with ida-rubicin and consolidation therapy with cytarabine. A follow-up bone marrow biopsy showed complete remission. He under-went allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation fol-lowing a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen with cyclo-phosphamide， fludarabine， and total body irradiation. After144 days， he presented with a five-day history of weakness， fatigue， and slow mentation. He denied skin rash， abdominal pain， diarrhea， shortness of breath， cough， sputum production， or other symptoms. His vital signs were normal， with a blood pressure of 97/58 mmHg， a temperature 36.2℃， a pulse rate of 87 bpm， a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute， and oxygen saturation (O， Sat) of 97% in room air.\n\n【4】On physical examination， he was somnolent， unable to rec-ognize his spouse， but was without focal neurological defi-cit. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain was unremark-able. Laboratory investigations were significant for a white blood cell count (WCC) of 5.2x10/ul， an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 3.3×10/L， a hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dL， hemato-crit of 12.6%， platelet count of 37 x 10 /ul， blood urea nitro-gen (BUN) of 30 mg/dL， creatinine of 1.26 mg/dL， albumin of2.9 g/dL， calcium 11.6 mg/dL， ionized calcium of 1.55 mmol/L， parathyroid hormone (PTH) <6.3 pg/mL， 25-hydroxy vitamin D of 14.4 ng/mL. Fifteen days before admission， his calcium levels were at 9.0 mg/dL. Serologic tests for Cryptococcal an-tigen and Aspergillus galactomannan were negative， and EBV serology was positive. A lumbar puncture test was unremark-able. Treatment began with intravenous cefepime 1 gm bid， normal saline at 150 ml/h per 1L， and the bisphosphonate， pamidronate， administered as a single dose of 90 mg.\n\n【5】Three days later， the patient's clinical status continued to de-cline. He developed a dry productive cough. His O， Sat was 90%， and his mental status declined. A chest CT showed bilateral diffuse lung infiltrates with ground glass opacities .\n\n【6】Treatment with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) at 5 mg/kg tid commenced for possible Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonitis (PJP). Bronchioalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy were negative for PJP， and the CMV viral load was 195IU/mL. Urinalysis for Histoplasma antigen and the Fungitell@assay were positive.\n\n【7】On further review of the patient’s history， he had spent most of his life in the Ohio River Valley area. A provisional diagno-sis of pulmonary histoplasmosis and CMV pneumonitis was made.TMP/SMX was discontinued and treatment with intrave-nous voriconazole (250 mg， bid) and ganciclovir (5 mg/kg， bid) commenced.A left lower lobe transbronchial biopsy showed small budding yeast forms， which showed positive histochem-ical staining for Histoplasma capsulatum . The lung biopsy was negative for CMV.\n\n【8】The diagnosis of pulmonary histoplasmosis was confirmed. The patient's mental status progressively improved as the hyper-calcemia resolved to a calcium level of 8.56 mg/dL. The patient was discharged from hospital on a seven-day course of cip-rofloxacin， a six to 12-week course of voriconazole，and pro-phylactic HBV therapy with entecavir， prophylactic PJP therapy with atovaquone， and prophylactic HSV therapy with acyclovir. At one-month outpatient follow-up， the patient was noted to have persistently elevated liver enzyme levels. Voriconazole was discontinued， and posaconazole， a triazole antifungal agent，\n\n【9】Histoplasmosis capsutatum is shown by lactophenol\n\n【10】cotton blue staining for chitin in the wall of the fungus.\n\n【11】400 mg every 12 hours， was commenced for a duration of 12weeks. Repeat serum and urinalysis for Histoplasma antigen remained negative. The patient's treatment was transitioned to a reduced secondary prophylactic dose of posaconazole. At a two-month outpatient follow-up， the patient remained asymp-tomatic but continued anti-infection prophylactic medications.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】A case report is presented that highlights one of many diverse presentations of histoplasmosis. This patient initially present-ed with the main complaint of altered mental status. General physical examination， review of his medications， and initial laboratory investigations were normal apart from hypercalce-mia. Brain computed tomography (CT) imaging without con-trast was negative for intracranial mass or hemorrhage. Lumbar puncture was negative for infection. However， only when the patient developed respiratory compromise and following fur-ther review of the patient's history， which identified he had lived in an endemic area in Ohio，that a diagnosis of histoplas-mosis was considered. The correlation between hypercalcemia and altered mental status was supported by the improvement in neurologic function when effective treatment commenced.\n\n【14】Although the presentation in this case was atypical， it was consistent with a diagnosis of acute pulmonary histoplas-mosis. Although histoplasmosis can be self-limiting， patients with significant bilateral chest infiltrates or who are immuno-suppressed require active treatment . First-line therapy forpulmonary histoplasmosis is either with amphotericin B， flu-conazole， or itraconazole. Typically， amphotericin B commenc-es at one to two weeks and is replaced by itraconazole for an additional 12 weeks of therapy . In this case， amphotericin treatment was not begun due to the moderate severity of the illness and possible drug interactions. This patient had a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 34%. Voriconazole was chosen as the first-line treatment， due to the black box warn-ing regarding itraconazole in patients with underlying conges-tive heart failure . The triazole antifungal agent， posacon-azole was used as salvage therapy and had a lower profile for causing hepatic damage when compared with voriconazole. The patient continued to be at risk for developing chronic pul-monary histoplasmosis， given his underlying immunodeficien-cy state. Patients treated for histoplasmosis are typically main-tained on antifungal therapy for at least 12-24 months， with follow-up chest CT at 6-monthly intervals . In this case， fol-low-up chest CT  showed a significant resolution of the initial lung abnormalities while the patient was receiving posaconazole maintenance therapy.\n\n【15】There have been at least six previously reported cases of his-toplasmosis associated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . There have been previously published cases of histoplasmosis associated with hypercalcemia . The diagnosis of histoplasmosis relies on a multidisciplinaryapproach that includes histopathology and microbiology ex-amination， urine， and serology antibody tests . Progressive disseminated histoplasmosis can present with hypercalcemia， which is attributed to increased vitamin D production from fungal granulomas . In this case， the differential diagno ses on the initial presentation may have included malignancy and other granulomatous diseases， both of which are associ-ated with hypercalcemia.\n\n【16】Conclusions\n\n【17】A case is presented of pulmonary histoplasmosis associated with altered mental state and hypercalcemia following allo-geneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for acute my eloid leukemia (AML). Although hypercalcemia a rare manifes-tation of histoplasmosis， lack of awareness of this association may lead to a delay in diagnosis and compromise patient out-come. This case report has highlighted the need for aware-ness of the diagnosis of histoplasmosis in patients with allo-geneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation who present with an altered mental state in the setting of hypercalcemia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Packing is the primary factor that helped tobacco companies in their advertisement. Standardized“plain\" cigarette packaging is advocated by Australia， then by World Health Organization (WHO) as a public health policy to reduce youth smoking initiation and promote smoking cessation to prevent and reduce morbidity and mortality caused by smoking. Plain packaging was in Australia's market in December 2012. Several other countries are then implemented plain packaging after facing some legal resistance from opponents. On behalf of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia， the minister of Health agreed upon the WHO initiative to adopt plain packaging as a tobacco control measure. In May 2019， plain packs were available in the Saudi market. Tobacco companies have challenged these public health policies. Additionally， consumers have made massive campaigns against new plain packs， claiming of taste change and quality alteration. The Decision-making of plain packaging is supported by quantitative and qualitative studies. Results are indicating that plain packaging can decrease positive perceptions of smoking and encourage to quit smoking Ministry of health， Saudi Food and Drug Agency and ministry of commerce coordinate work is essential in maintaining the policy and responding to any consumers' concerns. This can be implemented by evolving social media and web-services to raise smoker’s awareness and perception toward their tobacco use. Ensure that tobacco companies comply with international tobacco manufacturing standards. In this review report， we would like to show some evidence that supports and encourage continuing plain packaging and to recommend some solutions for consumer's anger and claims against these new packs.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS cigarettes， health policy， labeling，packaging， plain， plain packaging， smoking， tobacco， tobacco control\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Generic， standardized， neutral， or homogeneous packaging，are all names of what is known as the plain packaging of tobacco. It is referred to use standard packaging for tobacco products， typically cigarettes， with no special colors， images， logos and trademarks that refer to the brand. However the brand name to be included in the package in conditioned size， font and place on the pack， with health warning images and texts which alarm the user of the possible health consequences of using the product.\n\n【4】The outlook of all tobacco packs is to be standard and uni-fied for all brands. The rationale behind this plain packaging ismainly to disproportionate the consumption of tobacco products with the appealing design and colors of tobacco packs. Addition-ally， this aims to restrict the manufacturers' ability to advertise for their tobacco products and attract more young consumers.\n\n【5】In 1989 New Zealand was the first country that suggested the idea of standard plain packaging by using white pack with no logo . However， the first country applied plain packaging was Australia in 1st of December 2012. Packs were dark brown in color and logo-free. With such new striking legislation， a counter act from tobacco producers is highly expected as they fear of decline in their business activity. Although some companies legally sued the Australian government， the government eventu-ally won the court case which end by applying plain packaging from October 2012 . Shortly after， World Health Organiza-tion (WHO) included the plain packaging in their guidelines for tobacco control named“WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco control\"(WHO FCTC).On 31 May 2016， in the world No Tobacco day， WHO authorities asked governments to get ready for applying plain packaging initiative  .\n\n【6】Subsequently several other countries convinced to adopt the idea of plain packaging such as United Kingdom and France in2017，New Zealand， Ireland，Norway in 2018 and Saudi Arabia in 2019 .\n\n【7】Opposition to plain packaging\n\n【8】Some are considering plain packaging and other forms of polices such as tobacco taxes， as a form of social engineering . A study by Philip Morris International pointed that using plainpackaging would push consumer to buy cheaper brands instead of premium ones . Other claims to plain packaging were regarding the monitoring of legal sales in shops and retailers as well as its effect on smuggling . Mainly tobacco industries were against the idea， some even pursued legal actions against the governmental policies of plain packaging. The most famous of them were Phillip Morris and Imperial Tobacco . The arguments of these companies were plain packaging adds more manufacturing cost for factories. Furthermore， it is against the freedom of expression laws stated in the trade standards . However， these tobacco companies were eventually defeated in their lawsuits.\n\n【9】Plain packaging in Saudi Arabia：\n\n【10】Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in September 2018 has declared to WHO. It is going to adopt plain packaging soon to strengthen the available control measures for tobacco control . In May2019， Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) stated that appli-cation is mandatory . Saudi Arabia was the first country in Arab world that applied plain packaging initiative. Shortly after introduction of plain packaging， majority of smokers com-plain about the quality and taste of these products. They claim BT that it might contain wood and other dirty material which might cause health consequences more than cigarettes themselves.\n\n【11】Evidence supportive of plain packaging：\n\n【12】Upon the release of plain packaging in Australia， there was only indirect evidence of its effectiveness. Australian Cancer Council on 24 May 2011， published a review that supports the introduc-tion of plain packaging and its role in reducing the amount of smoking in young people . The review included twenty-four studies over two decades， results suggested that tobacco packaging serve to attract youth for trying cigarettes . Nev-ertheless， it was expected after applying plain packaging that smokers claim that cigarettes taste different and worse . Additionally， important evidence from quantitative and qualitative studies and documents from tobacco industry all were consistently indicate that packaging plays an essential role in tobacco promotion. Prevalence of smoking among Australian teenagers between 2013 and 2016 showed a decline from 3.4%to 1.5% in 12-17 age group and from 10.8% to 4.6% in 18-19 age group respectively  . Attitude toward smoking is proved to be changed by plain packaging . A decrease in overall smoking prevalence and an increase of attempts to quit smok-ing is also proved by implementing plain packaging . Comparative studies between regular branded packages and standards black packages， found the latter to be significantly less attractive to smokers . Furthermore， studies on youth experiences after they were instructed to use plain packaging confirmed that standard packaging increased their negative perception about packing and smoking. Additionally， some behaviors were associated with using plain packaging such as trying to hide or cover the pack， smokeless in groups， not carrying cigarettes while going out， and increased thinking about quitting. Almost half of the study group were adapting a new behavior by decreasing cigarette smoking . It is found that plain packaging makes the health warning in the card-board clearer and more effective to alarm smokers about health effects  . Using plain packaging with large warn-ing graphics significantly impact on smoking cessation. Recently， there is growing evidence that supports plain pack-aging role in tobacco control. Advantages of plain packaginginclude increasing attention and recognition to warning quotes and pictures  . Additionally， plain packaging tends to increase negative feelings about smoking and elevate quit rates . Moreover， standard packs are noticed to be less appealing and decrease brand awareness for tobacco consumers .\n\n【13】Solutions：\n\n【14】Using social media\n\n【15】The popularity of social media is undeniable. In the efforts against smoking， social media can be very beneficial， it targets all audiences. In a study conducted by the University of Water-loo， it was found that 32% of smokers who used web apps to quit smoking were successful in their attempts as opposed to 14% of smokers who used other resources such as telephone helplines. It is also noted that many social media users are young adults. According to the reports， the smoking rate is the highest in young adults compared to other age groups . Social media can be used to increase awareness about the“why\"part of quitting smoking instead of the \"how.\"Plain packaging cam-paigns should be exercised and regulated through social media. It would allow the audiences engaged to view it in the light of ef-fects that smoking causes， which are mentioned in abundance on the plain packages . Moreover， the plain package reduces the“status symbol\" associated with brands of cigarettes and replaces it with what the future of the smoker could be. That would help raise concern among smokers to maintain their self-image on social media， which would ultimately lead to a decrease in the smoking rate. The effect of branding and advertising over the element of customer appeal cannot be negated. It is the color， visual， and visibility of message on the packing of a material that initially inclines a user towards a product. In view of same consideration， the appeal to tobacco packages is resolved to be controlled with the use of plain packaging. By plain packaging， refers to the standardization of color and images intending to build customer belief and cultivate perception objectively. The legislative outline of the implication is covered under article introduces controls to make sure that the branding， advertising， promoting and sponsorship of the segment should not change the basic image of the effect of the use of products. Furthermore， the product packing should not give a fancy look that could relate the product with stats or style. Packaging should remind the user about the negative effect of the product for his health， environment， and the health of the surroundings.\n\n【16】Plain packaging effect based on behavioral science\n\n【17】Scholarly theories and arguments have justified with evidence and research that the decision making of the consumer is built over the factor of the psychological behavior against the product and its perception . There are famous motivational theo-ries that define the purpose and effect of actions that determine the health psychology of the consumer. The few theories that could be quoted in this reference include the Locus of control theory  by Rotter  which justifies that when a user is convinced that he is responsible for the effects of his actions then the response of the user towards a product and its use is all changed. In such an instance the informative images and graphic visual makes it evident that the outcome of the choice is the responsibility of the user. The other theory that could be referred to in support of raising consumer awareness with plain tobacco packing includes the theory of Self-efficacy by Bandura . This theory makes it evident that the belief of the user is connected with the perception of the outcome. In general， the branding and advertisements of tobacco are quite glamorous which gives the impression that the consumer is doing some-thing that could make him feel proud or good. On the contrary， when the plain packaging rules are implied then the actual side effects of the product use are embossed on the memory of the consumer which discourages the habit of smoking slowly and consistently. The attribution theory  also agrees to the stance making it obvious that the branding and promotional visuals or graphics of a product repeatedly strike the subconscious of a user and builds his belief or perception for a commodity. In par-ticular， a reference to tobacco packing， the visuals with warning and depiction of outcomes will build an expectation of the user for the outcome of his choice of smoking. Some of the posts are mentioned below for reference .\n\n【18】Governmental role\n\n【19】The immediate reaction from consumers regarding the taste of cigarettes was also noticed in other places where firstly plain packaging was implemented . However prompt reaction to tobacco consumer’s concern from SFDA would significantly help the decision maker's response. It would reassure con-sumers about the quality of the new plain tobacco products. Consequently， complaints have been filed despite the manufac-turers' insistence that there has been no change to their actual cigarettes， only to the packaging .\n\n【20】SFDA confirmed that it had examined all shipments arriving in the Saudi Arabia to ensure they adhere to regulations. In collaboration with the Ministry of Commerce， SFDA requested tobacco companies to respond to the complaint and sent the in-gredient and the country where cigarettes are manufactured. All have ensured their compliance with manufacturing regulations and packs， not the content is changed to standard ones according to WHO recommendations. Moreover， the SFDA took a sample from the accused tobacco packs to test the existence of any saw-dust material as claimed by consumers. Results were consistent with the standard ingredients of tobacco manufacturing and no results of sawdust material .\n\n【21】Recommendation\n\n【22】With the scientific and cost-effective evidence that supports plain packaging， it is wise to keep the policy acting. Health agencies to collaborate effectively to engage social media to oppose ru-mors and misleading facts with awareness and self-imaging information and quotes， as it proved by behavioral science in manipulating and mitigating consumption of tobacco. It is also noted that many social media users are young adults. According to the reports， the smoking rate is the highest in young adults compared to other age groups. Social media can be used to increase awareness about the “why\" part of quitting smoking instead of the“how\".\n\n【23】Plain packaging campaigns should be exercised and regu-alr lated through social media as it would allow the audiences en-gaged to view it in the light of effects that smoking causes， which are mentioned in abundance on the plain packages. Moreover， the plain package reduces the“status symbol\" associated with brands of cigarettes and replaces it with what the future of the smoker could be. That would help raise concern among smok-ers to maintain their self-image on social media， which would ultimately lead to a decrease in the smoking rate. Ongoing men-toring and supervision by SFDA and ministry of Commerce to ensure genuine tobacco importation and sales activities. Regular samples from tobacco markets to maintain measures of product and taste quality.\n\n【24】Conclusion\n\n【25】Plain packaging plays an excellent role in raising the awareness of future outcomes of smoking by detailing the adverse effects of smoking outright without any misleading statements or infor-mation. This demotivates the smokers from picking up a pack and leaves an image in the mind of the smoker since they look at it again and again. It can be observed that the primary target for plain packaging is young people who are starting or have not been smoking for more than a year. These efforts， combined with social media and the web， will help a lot of smokers to think about the need to quit smoking. Similarly， other adver-tising bans and larger awareness campaigns on social media can reduce the causes of death by tobacco， leading people to a healthier lifestyle change. Lastly， the initial counteract from consumers or producers against the plain packaging of tobacco is seen and expected according to other country's experience. Therefore， the professional and wi1SseP response of the government to the public reaction is essential to implement and maintain plain packaging policy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

In this diet， participants intentionally push themse lves into a state of ketosis and usually do not develop metabolic complications or illness unless put under certain cir-cumstances such as stress and prolonged fasting.\n\n【1】Case Report： We report a case of starvation ketoacidosis in a 60-year-old male with well-controlled diabetes mellitus type l following a strict ketogenic diet who then underwent prolonged fastingConclusions： Although the ketogenic diet with or without periods of fasting might yield short-term weight loss， it has poten-tially dangerous side effects， including ketoacidosis. It is recommended that people， especially those with co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus type ll， consult their physicians before initiating this diet. Clinicians must keep a broad differential when evaluating acute metabolic acidosis.\n\n【2】MeSH Keywords： Acidosis · Diet Fads ·Diet， Carbohydrate-Restricted· Fasting· Ketogenic Diet ·KetosisThe ketogenic diet is a strict nutritional regimen consist-ing of low carbohydrates， high fat， and adequate protein . Ketogenic diets have been used in the treatment of seizure dis-orders， neurodegenerative disorders， and more recently have become mainstream as a method for weight loss， although its weight loss implications have been described as early as the1800s . It can be modified by the addition of intermittent or prolonged fasting which will also restrict caloric intake. By reducing carbohydrate ingestion and exhausting the body's glucose reserve， there is a shift in metabolism into ketogene-sis， primarily by the hepatic oxidation of fatty acids. The ke-tones produced then become an important alternative to glu-cose as the body's energy source .\n\n【3】In certain conditions， this ketosis can develop into overt ke-toacidosis， causing a decrease in pH and serum bicarbonate level， leading to serious illness and hospitalization. While ke-toacidosis is most frequently associated with diabetes melli-tus type l and alcoholism， starvation， particularly in individu-als following low-carbohydrate and/or low-caloric diets， should not be overlooked as a possible etiology. Malnutrition and poor dietary intake are ways to enter a state of starvation that may result in ketoacidosis . Gastric banding has also been asso-ciated with a risk of starvation ketoacidosis . Besides keto-acidosis， the ketogenic diet may lead to electrolyte abnormal-ities， hypoglycemia， acute pancreatitis， and dyslipidemia .\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A 60-year-old male with a history of well-controlled diabetes mellitus type ll presented to the emergency department af ter having a witnessed syncopal episode at home. He was a follower of a vegetarian version of the popular ketogenic diet who engaged in intermittent fasting. While following this strict diet for roughly the past year and increasing his exer-cise， he reported losing 20 pounds and decreasing his hemo-globin A1C (HbA1C) from 11.5% to 7.0%. He decided to chal-lenge himself by going on a multiple day fast by foregoing food and only drinking water. He intended to transition into ketosis at a quicker rate， thereby possibly helping him further manage his diabetes.\n\n【6】After 5 days of fasting， the patient broke his fast by eating soup and taking a chlorophyll supplement， which he usually took， which caused him to vomit and become dizzy. He later syncopized in front of his wife， hitting his head on the shower door and briefly lost consciousness. He presented to the emer-gency department with persistent nausea and vomiting. His only prescription medication was metformin 500 mg twicea day， and he denied alcohol or recreational drugs. He did not take any alkalizing supplements.\n\n【7】On evaluation， he was hemodynamically stable with baseline normal mental function. Physical examination was unrevealing. Laboratory evaluation was notable for glucose 133 mg/dL， serum bicarbonate 19 mEq/L， anion gap 15 mEq/L， venous lac-tic acid 1.8 mmol/L a positive serum acetone in a diluted serum1： 4， plasma osmolality 305 mOsm/kg. sodium 139 mEq/L， and HbA1C 7.0%. A urinalysis had 2+ ketones and was negative for glucose pH from a venous blood gas on admission was 7.20.\n\n【8】Given the patient's history of intentional fasting， mild blood glucose elevation， and lack of alcohol use， the ketoacidosis was most probably due to starvation. He was started on intrave-nous hydration with dextrose 5%-0.9% normal saline. The next day， the patient's pH normalized on an arterial blood gas and anion gap decreased to 9. He reported resolution of symptoms and tolerated an oral diet. He was discharged home with in-structions to follow up with his primary care physician for fur-ther management.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】The ketogenic diet is a strict nutritional regimen consisting of low-carbohydrates， high-fat， and adequate protein that push-es one into a state of ketosis as the body's glucose reserve is depleted. Fat metabolism primarily in liver hepatocytes pro-duces 2 ketone bodies， i.e.， beta-hydroxybutyrate and aceto-acetate， that serve as substrates for energy production. As acid anions， beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate can result in a decreased blood pH (acidemia)， if present in higher levels. A third ketone， acetoacid is produced by the spontaneous decarboxyl-ation of acetoacetate， acetone， and is neutral and cannot al-ter blood pH . Acetone， however， has the ability to cross the alveolar membrane barrier of the lung and can be measured in one's breath， making it a convenient ketone biomarker .\n\n【11】One of the reasons for the increased popularity in the keto-genic diet is its effectiveness in weight loss. In a study that had obese adults undergo a 12-week ketogenic diet， significant weight loss was achieved (-18±9 kg in men versus -11±3 kg in women). There was also decreased emotional eating， increased body image satisfaction， and improved physical importance . Another study that focused on individuals with diabetes mel-litus type ll found that participants who followed a very-low-calorie ketogenic diet compared to those following a hypoca-loric diet had a significant reduction in weight loss and waist circumference and had better glycemic control .\n\n【12】It is hypothesized that using energy from protein in a keto-genic diet is more energy-intensive which results in the lossof more calories . Other proposed methods for weight loss in the ketogenic diet include a reduction in appetite due to a higher satiety effect of proteins， a possible direct appetite sup pression from ketone bodies， and increased lipolysis . By increasing his exercise and following a vegetarian ketogenic diet along with periods of fasting causing ketosis， our patient was able to lose about 10% of his total body weight and bet-ter manage his diabetes.\n\n【13】However， if the caloric intake is too low or a periodic fasting is performed， there is a chance to enter ketosis faster and possibly develop clinically significant ketoacidosis with symptoms such as fatigue， nausea， and vomiting. This is likely what happened to our patient. Other cases of ketoacidosis developing from low carbohydrate and high protein diets， such as the South Beach Diet and the Atkins Diet， have been reported .\n\n【14】Although there is data regarding the short-term success of low-caloric， low-carbohydrate diet， there is only limited data regarding the long-term success of the ketogenic diet - this might be due to the difficulty in maintaining a strict low-carbo-hydrate rule for longer periods of time. In studies on long-term (22 weeks) ketogenic diets in mice， the mice did not lose weight after an initial weight loss and had hepatic steatosis and glucose intolerance from decreased B-cell insulin secre-tion . The high protein and fat diet is also unlikely to be cardioprotective， since it might cause an increase in LDL cho-lesterol and serum triglycerides .\n\n【15】Starvation ketoacidosis is an uncommon cause of acute meta-bolic acidosis. In our patient， our initial differentials were pos-sible diabetic ketoacidosis (due to the fasting followed by vomiting) versus lactic acidosis (secondary to metformin use) versus acidosis due to herbal supplements (that sometimes contain unregulated additives). Through clinical and labora-tory evaluation， we were able to diagnose his fasting while on a ketogenic diet as the cause of acidosis.\n\n【16】In this patient with diabetes mellitus type ll， diabetic keto-acidosis should be considered as the cause of his metabolic acidosis. Diabetic ketoacidosis is typically seen in poorly con-trolled disease， a consequence of the inability to use glucose due to insulin deficiency in type l diabetes or increased insu-lin resistance in type Il diabetes . However， it was believed that the patient's diabetes was well controlled as evidenced by his HbA1C of 7%. He also did not use a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor which has been reported to cause an increased risk of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis. This risk is particularly high for patients who participate in pro-longed fasting， had large weight loss， or have major illness. Furthermore， euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis typically pres-ents with severe metabolic acidosis， while starvation ketoaci-dosis typically presents with a pH above 7.3 and serum bicar-bonate more than 18 mEq/L 15J. Clinicians must remember to keep a broad differential when evaluating patients with acute metabolic acidosis.\n\n【17】Conclusions\n\n【18】Although the ketogenic diet and other low-carbohydrate，high-protein diets with or without periods of fasting might yield short-term weight loss， they have potentially dangerous side effects， including ketoacidosis. It is recommended that peo-ple wishing to start a ketogenic diet， especially those with co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus type ll， first consult their physicians to discuss the risks and benefits. Furthermore， cli-nicians should remember to keep a broad differential diagno-sis when evaluating patients with acute metabolic acidosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Diagnosis requires surgical biopsy and histolog-ical tissue analysis. We describe the ECHO appearance of the solitary fibrous tumor and successful non-inva-sive EBUS diagnosis. This method of diagnosis allowed for surgical planning for resection and allowed us to exclude non-surgical diseases， such as small cell carcinoma.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】A 32-year-old man presented to his primary care physician with worsening intermittent chronic chest pain with recent progressive dysphagia， cough， and dyspnea. Physical examination and routine laboratory work-up were unrevealing. Chest radiograph and computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed a middle mediastinal mass. Flexible bronchoscopy confirmed extrinsic compression of right and left bronchial trees. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) was used to biopsy the mass and the diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumor was confirmed. The patient underwent successful tumor resection and was discharged home after an uneventful postopera-tive period.\n\n【4】Conclusions： Endobronchial ultrasound-directed tissue biopsy is an appropriate modality for suspected solitary fibrous tu-mors of the mediastinum. To our knowledge， this is only the second reported case of SFT diagnosed by EBUS-TBNA. Our case uniquely demonstrates the advantages of pre-surgical diagnosis of mediastinal masses with EBUS-TBNA when the diagnosis SFT is suggested on CT and US imaging.\n\n【5】MeSH Keywords： Biopsy， Fine-Needle·Bronchoscopes· Mediastinal Neoplasms· Solitary Fibrous Tumors·UltrasonographyMediastinal solitary fibrous tumors (SFT) are uncommon，slow-ly growing neoplasms typically diagnosed via surgical biop-sy. The presenting symptoms associated with SFTs are usu ally nonspecific， such as cough， dyspnea， and chest pain . Symptoms can also relate to the tumor location and the com-pressive effects on surrounding structures. SFTs typically have low malignant potential and surgical resection can be curative in most cases . SFTs are most commonly identified by cross-sectional imaging and have an appearance that is not reliably distinguishable from other soft tissue mediastinal tumors. In the absence of clearly pathognomonic imaging characteristics， confirmatory tissue diagnosis is required prior to resection.\n\n【6】The surgical approach for diagnosis can be challenging due to the close proximity of surrounding vascular structures. Endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscopy (EBUS) allows for real-time， minimally invasive fine-needle aspiration of mediastinal masses， and typ-ically has high diagnostic yield. We report the ultrasound char-acteristics and successful diagnosis of a middle mediastinal sol-itary fibrous tumor using EBUS-guided needle aspiration. To our knowledge， this is only the second reported case of SFT diag-nosed with EBUS-TBNA. The prior case report used EBUS in the diagnosis of recurrent SFTs . Our case illustrates the potential of used EBUS in the primary diagnosis of mediastinal masses when the diagnosis of SFT is suggested by CT and US imaging.\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】A previously healthy 32-year-old man presented to his prima-ry care physician with worsening intermittent chest pain for 6months. During the last month， he had developed progressive dysphagia， cough， and dyspnea. He denied constitutional symp-toms. He had smoked cigarettes for the past 16 years. There was no family history of malignancy or cardiovascular disease.\n\n【9】He was referred to his local emergency department for eval-uation. Physical examination and routine laboratory work-up were unrevealing. A chest radiograph showed indeterminate mediastinal opacity. A CT of the chest revealed a large hetero-geneous middle mediastinal mass measuring 15x17×18 cm， without associated lymphadenopathy . There was an-terior displacement of the heart and right pulmonary artery， with compression of the esophagus and adjacent main bronchi.\n\n【10】The patient underwent flexible bronchoscopy， which confirmed ex-trinsic compression of right and left bronchial trees. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) revealed a large， heterogeneous， cystic medi-astinal mass， which was sampled using a 22G needle . Gross examination of the excised specimen revealed a large tan-red to yellow lesion that was multicystic and partially necrotic，weighing 910 grams， and measuring 17.5x15.0x8.0cm . Histologically， the lesion was confirmed to be a solitary fibrous tumor with closely packed spindle cells with mitotic figures. Immunostaining of cells revealed staining positive for CD34 and negative for S-100 and keratin， consistent with SFT. The tumor was classified as high risk based on size， patient age， and number of mitotic figures per high-power field. The patient underwent successful tumor resection. Postoperatively， the pa-tient recovered well and was discharged home.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Solitary fibrous tumors (SFT) are a rare heterogeneous group of benign and malignant neoplasms of mesenchymal origin.\n\n【13】Most SFT are benign， occur both at intrathoracic and extra-thoracic locations， and are most commonly diagnosed be-tween the ages of 50 and 70 . Our patient was relatively young at the time of diagnosis. SFT are typically asymptom-atic and presenting symptoms often occur secondary to com-pression of adjacent structures， as observed in our case. Rare paraneoplastic syndromes have been reported with large tu-mors. Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (Pierre-Marie-Bamberger syndrome) has been described in 10-20% of pa-tients . In rare cases， hypoglycemia can occur secondary to secretion of insulin-like growth factor-2 .\n\n【14】Imaging studies include plain radiography， CT， and MRI. MR an-giography and Doppler ultrasonography have been proposed as diagnostic tools due to the highly vascular nature of these tumors . Definitive diagnosis requires histological analysis， usually via an invasive surgical approach. Diagnosis with en-dobronchial ultrasound-directed transbronchial needle aspira-tion (TBNA) allows for both real-time visualization and biopsy. Our patient's imaging (CT and ultrasound) were consistent in revealing a large multicystic mass， and biopsy confirmed a di-agnosis of SFT prior to surgical resection. This early diagnosis enabled additional time for surgical planning for resection and eliminated non-operative differential diagnoses prior to sur-gery. While EBUS-TBNA can be a valuable tool in the diagno-sis of mediastinal tumors， tissue sampling occurs via an aspi-ration of cells rather than a core biopsy. The cytologic nature of this can be a limitation in terms of overall diagnostic yield.\n\n【15】Microscopically， SFT demonstrates closely packed spindle cells， prominent vascular channels， and zones of hypercellular，hypocellular， and fibrotic areas . Immunostaining of SFT is not specific， but is usually positive for CD34， CD99， and B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)， and negative for S100 and cytokera-tins. Recent studies indicate that SFT has a NAB2-STAT6 fusion gene and nuclear STAT6 immunoreactivity， which may prove to be useful in diagnosis of SFT .\n\n【16】Definitive treatment is surgical resection. Thirty percent of patients have a reoccurrence after surgical resection . Continued long-term follow-up with serial cross-sectional im-aging is recommended， as late reoccurrence has been report-ed (>10 years) . Prognosis is calculated using a risk strat-ification model. Factors associated with an increased risk of metastasis and poor outcome include： larger tumor size (≥15cm)， increased mitotic figures (24/10 high-power fields)， and advanced patient age (255 years). Five-year survival for pa-tients undergoing complete resection is 89-100%.\n\n【17】Conclusions\n\n【18】Endobronchial ultrasound-directed tissue sampling is an ap-propriate modality for suspected solitary fibrous tumors of the mediastinum and can be used to obtain adequate diagnostic tissue specimens. To our knowledge， this is only the second reported case of SFT diagnosed by EBUS-TBNA. Our case dem-onstrates the advantages of pre-surgical diagnosis of medi-astinal masses with EBUS-TBNA when the diagnosis of SFT is suggested by CT and US imaging.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "15f42acc-367e-4ddb-90d0-7b6a6b9ef3ed", "title": null, "text": "【0】Background：\n\n【1】Amyloidosis is a multisystem disease caused by deposition of dysfunctional protein-amyloid-in various organs. The heart is commonly involved， especially in primary (AL) and transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis. Most patients present with restrictive cardiomyopathy along with other systemic features of amyloid deposition. Diagnosing amyloidosis is cumbersome and based on the patient's clinical condition and findings from electrocardiog-raphy， routine laboratory tests， cardiac biomarkers， imaging， and biopsy. Echocardiography (echo) is a widely available diagnostic imaging method that can help raise suspicion of cardiac amyloidosis (CA) if novel param-eters of systolic dysfunction are used， which are based on strain measurement complemented with traditional morphologic and hemodynamic traits. A definitive diagnosis of amyloidosis requires biopsy. It is important to differentiate between AL and ATTR amyloidosis because the treatment approaches for them differ. The prog nosis for CA is still dismal but can be improved with early diagnosis and institution of treatment.\n\n【2】Case Report： Our patients presented with advanced heart failure and subtle clinical signs of amyloidosis. AL amyloidosis was diagnosed based on echo findings and confirmed with bone marrow biopsy. In this report， we describe classic nonspecific echo signs followed by novel parameters of systolic dysfunction.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】Because the symptoms and signs of amyloidosis are nonspecific， the diagnosis requires a high level of clini-cal suspicion. Severe diastolic heart failure should prompt a further search for subtle signs on echo that indi-cate possible amyloid deposition disease. Use of systolic strain analysis increases the specificity of echo for diagnosis of amyloidosis. Echo results combined with specific clinical symptoms and results of a hematology workup can be used to diagnose CA when other， less common tests are not available or invasive testing is not desirable.\n\n【5】MeSH Keywords： Amyloidosis · Cardiomyopathy， Restrictive · Echocardiography\n\n【6】Amyloidosis is the general term for a clinical condition caused by accumulation of different precursor proteins with unstable tertiary structure clumping into insoluble amyloid fibrils， which leads to dysfunction in various organs . Cardiac involvement is crucial， because when present， it is a marker of disease se-verity and indicator of prognosis. The 2 most common causes of clinically relevant cardiac amyloidosis (CA) are light chain amyloidosis (AL)， also called primary amyloidosis， and trans-thyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) . AL amyloidosis is a primary plasma cell disorder that occurs on its own or in association with multiple myeloma . Immunoglobulin light chains have an additional direct toxic effect on myocytes； therefore， the clini-cal presentation is more severe than in ATTR amyloidosis .\n\n【7】The median age at diagnosis of amyloidosis is 64 years，and two-thirds of cases are in men . ATTR amyloidosis results from deposition of the abnormal transport protein transthyre-tin， mainly in the heart and peripheral nerves. The 2 subtypes are wild-type ATTR and mutant ATTR. Wild-type ATTR CA has been increasingly recognized as a cause of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in elderly individuals and will prob-ably become the most common form of CA in that population.\n\n【8】Differentiating between AL and ATTR CA is crucial because the prognosis and therapy for them are completely different . Diagnosis is based on identifying clinical signs of cardiac and extracardiac involvement and on results of laboratory tests， electrocardiography (ECG)， and echocardiography (echo) in all patients with clinical suspicion of CA. A definitive diagnosis of amyloidosis (especially the AL subtype) requires histologi-cal confirmation and typing of the amyloid precursor on tissue biopsy. A biopsy of the clinically involved organ is not always necessay because most patients can be diagnosed based on analysis of an abdominal fat pad aspirate or biopsy of a mi-nor labial salivary gland. Cardiac biomarkers (N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide \\[NT-proBNP\\]and troponin) are cru-cial for diagnosing cardiac involvement. They can be positive even before symptoms occur， have prognostic significance， and increasingly are being used to monitor disease progres-sion and response to treatment. Echo is the mainstay of diag-nostic imaging because of its wide availability and reproduc-ibility . Numerous classic and novel echo signs are relatively specific for CA and the testing also offers prognostic informa-tion . Additional tests， such as magnetic resonance imag-ing (MRI)， scintigraphy with bone tracers， and genetic analy-sis， can be performed on an individual basis and depending on their availability. Early diagnosis is the determinant of prog-nosis， especially in AL amyloidosis， for which antineoplastic therapy should be administered as soon as possible . The amyloidosis subtype and disease stage determine the strate-gy for treatment， which can include chemotherapy， stem celltransplantation (SCT)， and liver transplantation . We present the cases of 3 patients with advanced heart failure who were diagnosed with AL amyloidosis based on their clinical presen-tation and results of echo， laboratory testing， and bone mar-row biopsy. We also discuss the echo parameters for diagno sis of the disease and assessment of prognosis.\n\n【9】Case Report\n\n【10】Patient 1 was admitted for newly diagnosed heart failure with high levels of natriuretic peptides and chronically elevated tro-ponin values . During standard treatment， he had ex-perienced transitory aphasia without structural cerebral dam-age and recovered completely. ECG showed low voltage in the limb leads with a pseudoinfarction pattern in the precordial leads . That finding along with the patient’s clinical presentation (periorbital hematoma， thickened tongue， pro-teinuria below the nephrotic range， and a decreased glomer-ular filtration rate) and echo findings  were highly suspicious for amyloidosis.\n\n【11】Spontaneous echo contrast was detected in the man's heart cavities， possibly explaining his recent cardioembolic cerebral event despite sinus rhythm. Monoclonal protein-immunoglob-ulin G (IgG) and lambda light chains were detected on further hematological workup (serum and urine protein immunofix-ation， serum kappa/lambda free light chain \\[FLC\\] ratio). Bone marrow biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of multiple myeloma：20% CD138+ atypical plasma cells with Congo red-positive am-yloid infiltrates. Chemotherapy was started， but unfortunately， the patient died 2 months later from refractory heart failure.\n\n【12】Patient 2 also presented with a first episode of mainly right-sided heart failure (NT-proBNP 10940 ng/L). She was a sep-tuagenarian and already cachectic upon admission， with gen-eralized edema. Echo revealed advanced-stage restrictive cardiomyopathy with significant reduction in left ventricular systolic function (LVSF) and telltale signs of potential amyloi-dosis . Upon cardiac recompensation， the patient was transferred to the Hematology Department and diagnosed with multiple myeloma (lgG， lambda light chains) with amy-loidosis based on bone marrow biopsy. Clinical and radiologic staging showed additional involvement of the tongue， kidney(proteinuria)， and liver (enlargement and infiltration on com-puted tomography \\[CT\\] scan). After 3 cycles of chemotherapy， the patient died from an ischemic stroke.\n\n【13】Patient 3 had a relatively short history of chronic heart fail-ure with a mildly reduced LV ejection fraction. She deteriorat-ed progressively despite evidence-based therapy. During her last hospitalization for worsening heart failure， a repeat echo raised suspicion for amyloidosis based on morphologic traits，the restrictive left ventricle filling pattern， and a characteris-tic regional reduction in longitudinal strain . One week later， the patient had a thrombosis of the inferior vena cava with a kidney infarction. Further workup fulfilled the crite-ria for diagnosis of multiple myeloma with amyloidosis： mono-clonal lambda light chains in serum and urine electrophore-sis， bone marrow infiltration with atypical plasma cells， Congo red-positive amyloid fibers， and involvement of the heart， liv-er， kidney， and tongue. A cardiac biopsy also was performed but the result was nondiagnostic. The patient currently is re-ceiving chemotherapy in preparation for autologous SCT. The clinical and echo parameters for all 3 patients are summa-rized in Table 1.\n\n【14】Table 1.

Our patients were initially diagnosed in a general hospital that covers a population of 120 000， so the 3 cases are a surprising-ly high incidence in a short time span of 10 months. Median time to diagnosis was 5 months， while other authors have re-ported a median of 10 to 22 months . The small number of patients in our report does not for allow direct comparisons； nevertheless， they were all diagnosed fairly swiftly. The median age of patients with AL amyloidosis is 60， most of whom are men . The diagnosis is suspected when the clinical presenta-tion includes classic findings， such as microvoltage and a pseu-doinfarction pattern on ECG (present in all 3 of our patients)\nand hyperechogenic speckled myocardium on echo . All of our patients had chronically mildly elevated cardiac troponin values， reflecting continuous necrosis of myocytes and signif-icantly elevated NT-proBNP values， which correlated with the clinical picture of advanced heart failure. Cardiac biomarkers are excellent parameters for monitoring disease progression，staging， and determining prognosis. A widely used staging sys-tem from 2004 relied solely on 2 cardiac biomarkers： troponin(T or l) and NT-proBNP . It was revised in 2012， adding the absolute difference in FLCs as a third variable .\n\n【18】Echo done based on a high level of clinical suspicion for the pathology was the key to further workup and achievement of definitive diagnosis in our patients. Biopsy of clinically affect-ed organs or less invasive and， therefore， more widely usedabdominal fat pad aspirate and biopsy of a salivary gland is mandatory for the diagnosis of AL amyloidosis. All of our pa-tients had bone marrow biopsies， which showed clonal plas-ma cells consistent with multiple myeloma and amyloid infil-tration， detected by Congo red staining. One should always keep in mind the differential diagnosis between AL and ATTR amyloidosis. For instance， ATTR amyloidosis can occur with un-related monoclonal gammopathy， such as monoclonal gam-mopathy of undetermined significance， which requires follow up and no chemotherapy.\n\n【19】Peak systolic strain\n\n【20】In all of our patients， the diagnosis of multiple myeloma with amyloidosis was clear and performing additional routine car-diac biopsy would not have affected treatment. Scintigraphy with technetium pyrophosphate (99mTc-PYP)， which tradition-ally has been used as a bone tracer， has 100% specificity to differentiate between AL and ATTR CA， so it could be done to definitively exclude coexisting ATTR (which is highly unlike-ly) . Cardiovascular MRI (cMRI) shows a typical pattern of late gadolinium ehnancement in CA， and it is suggested after echo in a CA diagnosis algorithm . ATTR CA amyloidosis can even be diagnosed without biopsy. Positive scintigraphy with bone-avid tracers (Grade 2 or 3 tracer uptake) in the absence of detectable monoclonal protein in serum or urine providesa reliable nonhistological diagnosis .Unfortunately， cMRI is still not widely available for routine use.\n\n【21】Our cases demonstrate that echo followed by a hematology workup (monoclonal protein detection and bone marrow bi-opsy) is a possible pathway to diagnosis of AL amyloidosis in a large number of patients， obviating the need for routine car-diac biopsy. Most patients with CA have relatively preserved LVSF on presentation. That makes diagnosis of CA even hard-er because most clinicians would expect isolated advanced di-astolic dysfunction . Unfortunately， all of our patients had advanced disease with high amyloid burden and concomitant systolic dysfunction. When myocardial amyloid burden reach-es a certain threshold， cardiac damage is known to become ir-reversible and chemotherapy does not appear to improve out-comes . Two of our 3 patients had cerebral ischemic events despite sinus rhythm. Risk for thrombosis is greatly increased with ventricular diastolic dysfunction and atrial mechanical dysfunction； therefore， anticoagulation should be considered as an option in all patients with CA .\n\n【22】Multiple studies have shown that strain abnormalities can be an early marker of CA， often before symptoms of conges-tive heart failure . Most of the classic echo parameters are relatively nonspecific for CA . An apical sparing pattern of longitudinal strain impairment has high sensitivity (93%) and specificity (82%) for CA . Relative apical sparing also can be seen on 2-dimensional speck-le-tracking echo in patients with more common causes of myo-cardial thickening， such as hypertension and aortic stenosis. Additional information can be gained by analyzing dissocia-tion between relatively preserved left ventricular ejection frac-tion (LVEF) and profoundly reduced global longitudinal strain(GLS)， expressed as LVEF/GLS ratio. This parameter can also be used to differentiate CA from other causes of LV hypertro-phy. An EF/GLS ratio higher than 4.1 has 89.7% sensitivity and91.7% specificity for a CA diagnosis j. Our patients met these criteria. Various prognostic factors can be assessed with echo. Increased septal thickness， E/e’ratio (ratio between early mitral inflow velocity and mitral annular early diastolic veloc-ity)， and reduced LVEF all indicate worse prognosis regardless of the type of amyloidosis . In patients with AL amyloido-sis and preserved LVEF， a GLS value less than-14.81 has been shown to be a predictor of all-cause mortality j. Basal-apex gradient of strain can be expressed as relative regional strain ratio (RRSR). An RRSR higher than 1.19 also predicts high-er mortality or progression to heart transplantation .\n\n【23】Conclusions\n\n【24】CA is the most common cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy and should be considered in all patietns with heart failure whopresent with preserved LVEF. The prognosis is determined by the extent of myocardial damage and total amyloid burden. Overall， it has improved consistently because of advances in diagnosis and treatment. Now even patients with stage 4 AL CA have a median survival of 5.8 months . Shorteningthe time from symptom onset to diagnosis is the key to improving outcomes. Our cases show how full use of echo in conjunction with clinical presentation，ECG， cardiac biomarkers， M protein detection， and bone marrow biopsy can sometimes provide a definitive diagnosis of CA in patients with AL amyloidosis without the need for an invasive organ biopsy. Unfortunately， technical limitations at our center did not permit us to performfuther amyloid typing. Novel， relatively specific parameters such as apical sparing or EF/GLS ratio also should be used. Chemotherapy and autologous SCT is the treatment regimen of choice for AL amyloidosis， particularly when a patient also has heart involvement. Unfortunately， the prognostic param-eters proved reliable in our patients， and only 1 was alive 6months after diagnosis， despite treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

WE is most commonly caused by excessive alcohol use， but also has diverse nonalcoholic etiologies. Here we describe 2 cases of nonalcoholic WE with different etiologies that were initially misdiagnosed due to lack of correlation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings with clinicalinformation.\n\n【2】Case Reports：\n\n【3】Patient A， a 50-year-old woman with recent gastric sleeve surgery， presented with horizontal gaze-evoked nys-tagmus， ataxia， and altered mental status. MRI fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) revealed isolated bilateral， symmetrical， thalamic hyperintensities， initially diagnosed as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.Are-view of imaging and clinical presentation provided an alternate diagnosis of nonalcoholic WE secondary to nu-tritional deficiency. Intravenous (IV) thiamine improved symptoms with resolution of MRI findings 6 months later.\n\n【4】Patient B， a 64-year-old woman， presented with nausea， vomiting， dizziness， altered mental status， and weight loss. MRI FLAIR revealed isolated bilateral， symmetrical， thalamic hyperintensities， initially determined to be ischemia， prompting stroke management. A diagnosis of nonalcoholic WE was suggested， given the patient's low thiamine levels and history of malnutrition， and was confirmed by her excellent therapeutic response to IV thiamine.\n\n【5】Conclusions：\n\n【6】Nonalcoholic WE remains a challenging diagnosis because of the variable clinical presentation， myriad of un-derlying etiologies， and lack of standardized diagnostic laboratory tests. A multidisciplinary approach with close collaboration between the radiologist and clinical care team is critical to narrow down the differential and initi-ate correct management. WE is a reversible disease with catastrophic consequences if it is not recognized and treated promptly.\n\n【7】MeSH Keywords：\n\n【8】Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome · Pulvinar· Thalamic Nuclei· Thiamine Deficiency·Wernicke EncephalopathyWernicke’s encephalopathy (WE) poses a significant diag nostic challenge， especially when the patient does not have a history of alcohol use. The clinical triad of gait ataxia，oph-thalmoplegia， and altered mental status is well established， though it lacks sensitivity (16%) . The Caine criteria  has been developed to help make an early diagno-sis， but a high index of clinical suspicion is still required . Clinicians often rely on ancillary testing， especially neuroim-aging， to narrow down the diagnostic possibilities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has low sensitivity (50%) but high specificity (93%)， thus making it the most reliable confirma-tory test . However， patients with nonalcoholic WE present with highly variable neuroimaging findings， making the diagno-sis even more challenging. In both of our patients， an isolated pulvinar/hockey stick sign was the sole radiological manifes-tation in the absence of other classic neuroimaging features. Awareness of these radiological signs with an appropriate clin-ical context is critical to formulate the appropriate differential diagnosis and avoid unnecessary testing and anxiety for the patient and family members.\n\n【9】Here we describe 2 cases of nonalcoholic WE with different etiologies， both of which were initially misdiagnosed because of lack of correlation of MRI findings with clinical information.\n\n【10】Table 1. Caine criteria.\n\n【11】Must have 2 of 4 signs to diagnose Wernicke’s encephalopathy.\n\n【12】Patient A\n\n【13】Patient A， a 50-year-old woman with a history of morbid obe sity， gastric sleeve surgery (GSS) 3 months prior， and cholecys-tectomy 2 months prior presented with horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus， ataxia， and altered mental status (Videos 1A， 2A). She reported no history of drug or alcohol abuse. Lab workup revealed the following results： white blood cell (WBC) count11， hemoglobin (Hb) 16.3， platelets 346， sodium 152，glucose109， lactate 4.5， aspartate transaminase (AST) 54， alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 95， albumin 4.5， creatinine 1.1， blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 16， thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)3.09，B。 975， ammonia 29， copper 108， and zinc 102. Anti-double stranded DNA， anti-RNP， and anti-Smith antibody pan-els were negative. The thiamine level for this patient was not available because of hospital policy. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed no pleocytosis， glucose 53， or protein 113and was positive for oligoclonal bands and negative for syphi-lis. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed mild diffuse slow-ing (7Hz) intermixed with low-voltage fast activity， signifying mild encephalopathy. A computed tomography (CT) scan did not show any signs of acute intracranial abnormalities. MRI flu-id-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) revealed isolated bi-lateral symmetrical thalamic hyperintensities (pulvinar/double hockey stick sign) ， without diffusion restriction. No contrast enhancement was seen on gadolinium T1-weighted imaging and on FLAIR sequencing， white matter hyperintensi-ties potentially reflecting chronic microvascular disease were seen . No signal changes were seen in the mammil-lary bodies， the wall of the third ventricle， periaqueductal gray matter， floor of the fourth ventricle， or the tectal plate. The ra-diologist raised the possibility of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob dis ease (vCJD)， given the isolated finding of pulvinar/hockey stick sign. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck did not reveal stenosis or vascular malformations.\n\n【14】The patient was started empirically on IV thiamine (500 mg TID). Her horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus improved within2 to 3 days. The mild encephalopathy resolved within 4 to 5days and she returned to her normal cognitive baseline. The patients' gait remained ataxic， but she was able to ambulate with a walker while working with a physical therapist. A diag-nosis was made of nonalcoholic WE due to nutritional deficien-cy (secondary to GSS). The diagnosis was supported by clin-ical improvement following initiation of parenteral thiamine. Further insight into the history revealed that the patient was prescribed oral vitamin supplementation but was noncompli-ant.vCJD was ruled out with a negative CSF real-time quaking-induced conversion assay. She was discharged to an inpatient rehabilitation facility on high-dose ⅣV thiamine (500 mg TID) for persistent ataxic symptoms. Her gait continued to improve with intensive physical therapy. She was discharged home， and due to her increased risk of chronic thiamine deficiency. was given a lifelong prescription for thiamine supplementa-tion (100 mg/d orally). Three months later， follow-up at an out-patient neurology clinic revealed drastic clinical improvement with resolution of nystagmus and ataxia (Videos 1B， 2B). The patient's thiamine level was measured and found to be within the therapeutic range (171.8 nmol/L). An outpatient MRI done6 months after that revealed resolution of the thalamic FLAIR abnormality/hockey stick sign .\n\n【15】Patient B\n\n【16】Patient B is a 64-year-old woman with a history of hyperten-sion， rheumatoid arthritis， and primary hyperparathyroidism status post parathyroidectomy who presented with nausea， vomiting， dizziness， altered mental status， and weight loss. Over the past few weeks， she had been exposed to insecti-cides and bug sprays that were used to try to eradicate a bed bug infestation and she did not connect this exposure with her symptoms. She reported no history of drug or alcohol abuse. Lab workup revealed the following results： WBC 6.1， Hb 13.9， platelets 119，international normalized ratio 1.3， sodium 153， glucose 90， creatinine 1.7， BUN 31， AST 60， ALT 42， albumin2.8， TSH 2.090， B 2496， ammonia 37， copper 86， zinc 66， and thiamine <7. An EEG showed 7Hz diffuse slowing， signi-fying mild encephalopathy， with no epileptic discharges. A CT scan showed no acute intracranial abnormalities. MRI FLAIR revealed isolated bilateral symmetrical thalamic hyperintensi-ties. Diffusion-weighted imaging did not show any restricted diffusion. No contrast enhancement was seen on a gadolini-um chelate-enhanced T1-weighted image. No signal changes were seen in the mammillary bodies， tectal plate， wall of the third ventricle， periaqueductal gray matter， or the floor of the fourth ventricle. Ischemic changes (artery of Percheron stroke) were originally suggested in the differential， but on review by a neuroradiologist， the symmetrical thalamic hyperintensities were recognized as the hockey stick sign . A diagnosisof nonalcoholic WE was considered， given the patient's histo-ry of malnutrition， significant weight loss with low thiamine levels， and radiological findings. She was started empirically on I thiamine (500 mg TID)， and within 2 to 3 days， her al-tered mental status and dizziness dramatically improved. She was discharged home within 3 days， on a regimen of oral thi-amine (100 mg/d). Unfortunately， no post-treatment thiamine levels or neuroimaging were available because the patient was lost to follow-up.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】A broad differential diagnosis needs to be considered when a patient presents with rapidly progressive cognitive impairment. These include infection (HSV-1， Whipple disease)， metabolic syndromes (thiamine deficiency， hypothyroidism)， autoimmune conditions (Hashimoto's thyroiditis， anti-VGKC encephalitis)， vascular disorders (artery of Percheron stroke， top of the bas-ilar artery syndrome)， neurodegenerative conditions (CJD)， and neoplastic etiologies (glioblastoma multiforme and cere-bral metastases) . A patient's clinical features， associated laboratory findings and radiological markers serve as diagnos-tic clues. In our cases， predisposing factors and accompanyingfeatures of ataxia， horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus， and al-tered mental status， plus presence of a pulvinar/double hock-ey stick sign were suggestive of nonalcoholic WE. The diag-nosis was confirmed with an excellent therapeutic response to parenteral thiamine and resolution of radiological signs.\n\n【19】Table 2. Nonalcoholic etiologies of Wernicke's encephalopathy.\n\n【20】WE is reversible and commonly misdiagnosed because of un-derrecognition of nonalcoholic etiologies . It has a male pre-dominance， with a female-to-male ratio of 1： 1.7.Excessive alcohol use remains the most common etiology of WE， with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome being prevalent in 12.5% of al-cohol abusers . Nonalcoholic etiologies  are in-creasingly being recognized.\n\n【21】GSS is increasingly becoming the preferred restrictive bariat-ric procedure for morbid obesity， given that success rates are higher compared to malabsorptive surgeries such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and the side effects are minimal . The incidence of chronic thiamine deficiency associated with malabsorptive procedures is 49%， as compared to 18.75%for GSS . The classic WE triad (ophthalmoplegia， atax-ia， and encephalopathy)， is seen in a substantially higher per-centage of patients (54.2%) after bariatric surgery than with an alcoholic etiology (16%) . This was also seen in our Patient A， who presented with the classic WE triad after undergoing GSS.\n\n【22】Patients with GSS have lower thiamine levels owing to mul-tiple factors. GSS results in decreased hydrochloric acid pro-duction ， which affects absorption of water-soluble vita-mins such as thiamine in the proximal small intestine . Furthermore， GSS involves removal of the fundus and cor-pus， which contain the interstitial cells of Cajal that are re-sponsible for controlling stomach motility . Resection of these segments induces pathological hypermotility， thus af-fecting nutrient absorption and contributing to thiamine de-ficiency . In addition， lack of insight into the risk of devel-oping WE， along with inadequate nutritional education， leadsto 10.3% of post-bariatric surgery patients being noncompli-ant with oral vitamin supplementation . Persistent vom-iting (87.3%) is the most common postoperative cause of WE and physicians should be conscious of this correlation and sup-plement with thiamine via the parenteral route .Our Patient A， however， did not experience postoperative emesisThe European Federation of Neurological Societies and the Royal College of Physicians have recommended I thiamine (500 mg TID) for acute treatment until WE symptoms resolve . The American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery states that patients who have undergone bariatric surgery should re-ceive supplemental I thiamine 200 mg TID to 500 mg QD/BID for 3 to 5 days， followed by 250 mg/d for 3 to 5 days or un-til symptoms resolve . Then consider treatment with 100mg/d orally， until risk factors resolve， although usually， indef-inite treatment is required . However， there is no consen-sus as to the ideal dosage and duration of thiamine supple-mentation .\n\n【23】Patient B's nutritional deficiency was due to long-term expo-sure to insecticides (3 weeks)， which induced persistent vom-iting with a consequent loss of thiamine storage. We hypoth-esize that her sex and a potentially low thiamine level (before exposure to insecticides) may have contributed to the onset of WE. Women are at risk of losing thiamine stores at a high-er rate than men . In addition， it is imperative for physi-cians to know that individuals with low body weight are also at risk of easily losing thiamine stores \n\n【24】Clinical features of WE can be correlated with lesions seen on MRI. Involvement of the brainstem cranial nerve nuclei (Ⅲ& VI)， cerebellar vermis and vestibular nuclei， midline reticu-lar activating system of the thalamus and mammillary bodies correlates with presentation of ophthalmoplegia， ataxia， and altered mental status， respectively . The radiological find-ings associated with mental status changes can be seen as isolated features on MRI ， whereas regions corresponding to vestibular and ocular symptoms can be subradiographic， as noticed in both of our patients . The most prevalent sign of thiamine deficiency is horizontal gaze-evoked nystag-mus . Brainstem nuclei are highly susceptible to thiamine deficiency due to higher metabolic demand and disruption of the blood-brain barrier . This contributes to the devel-opment of horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus as the earliest manifestation of WE . Late signs such as altered men-tal status (memory impairment， delirium， coma) occur when diencephalic and cortical neurons are affected . Caine’s cri-teria of dietary deficiency along with horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus and ataxia should be recognized as early manifes-tations of WE， whereas encephalopathy is identified as a late clinical sign .\n\n【25】Thiamine deficiency is the cornerstone pathological mecha-nism of WE. Patients who have a deficiency for more than17 days require exogenous thiamine supplementation ， while 4 or more weeks of deficiency leads to the onset of WE symptoms . Patient A started to experience symptoms ap-proximately 2 months post-GSS. Patient B presented with WE symptoms secondary to 3 to 4 weeks of continuous exposure to insecticides and intractable nausea and vomiting. Thiamine is involved in multiple biochemical pathways that affect pro-duction of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)， such as the Krebs cycle and the pentose phosphate pathway . ATP deficien-cy causes cytotoxic or vasogenic edema while pyruvate accu-mulation leads to lactic acidosis in susceptible areas in the brain . These include the medial thalami (85%)， third ventri-cle (80%)， periaqueductal gray matter (59%)，mammillary bod-ies (45%)， and the tectal plate (36%). Less commonly affect-ed areas include the cranial nerve nuclei (18%)， periventricular gray matter anterior to the fourth ventricle (7%)， cerebellum(5%)， vermis (4%)， dentate nuclei (1.8%)， and the precentral and postcentral cortices (1.8%) . However， in both of our cases， the medial thalami were the only structures in-volved， thus adding to the diagnostic dilemma.\n\n【26】The thalamus acts as a relay center for sensorineural pathways and is divided into different nuclei . The pulvinar nucleus is the largest and plays a role in visual attention and modification of behavioral responses . The dorsomedi-al nucleus， the largest medial nucleus， is involved in memory，learning， and other cognitive functions . The pulvinar sign is defined as a symmetrical hyperintensity of only the pulvinar thalamic nuclei . A hockey stick sign is defined as concurrent symmetric hyperintensity of the dorsomedial thala-mi and pulvinar nuclei . Pulvinar/hockey stick signs have high specificity for vCJD  but can be seen in various other pathologies . Appropriate identification of these signs on MRI in combination with a patient's clinical presen-tation is critical for appropriate diagnosis and treatment . Patient A was diagnosed with vCJD because of the isolated pulvinar sign. This caused panic for her family and could have delayed therapeutic intervention. Patient B initially had a dif-ferential diagnosis of ischemic changes on MRI， which result-ed in initiation of a stroke management pathway.\n\n【27】Left untreated， WE is potentially life-threatening， with a mor-tality rate up to 20% . It can proceed to irreversible Korsakoff syndrome， characterized by severe global amnesia(retrograde， anterograde， episodic) and confabulation . Chronic thiamine deficiency also can lead to several different types of beriberi (cardiac and neuropathic). Although cardiac(systolic heart failure) and neuropathic (axonal sensory poly-neuropathy) beriberi classically occur chronically， the latter can present acutely with flaccid paralysis mimicking acute inflam-matory demyelinating polyneuropathy . Shoshin beriberi， a subtype of cardiac beriberi， presents as severe refractory hy-potension， tachycardia，hypothermia， leukocytosis， acute kid-ney injury， and lactic acidosis， leading to acute cardiovascular collapse， as described by Tan et al.\n\n【28】We recognize that our report has a few limitations. Thiamine levels were not measured during Patient A's hospital course. Testing for thiamine largely depends upon institutional poli-cies. Measurement of serum thiamine is not widely available due to lack of standardization and has a poor correlation with clinical symptomatology ； thus， diagnosing WE is evenmore challenging. Another limitation to diagnosis of WE in both of our patients was an oversight in performing the head impulse test. This test signifies damage to the brainstem nu-clei (nucleus prepositus hypoglossi and medial vestibular nu-cleus) . Loss of bilateral horizontal vestibulo-ocular re-flex (VOR) with intact vertical VOR has been proposed to be a highly specific predictor of WE . It is important to note that covert saccades are difficult to visualize on physical ex-amination； therefore， the video head impulse test has been developed to ease diagnosis .\n\n| MRI T2-FLAIR hyperintensity  |  | Pathology  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Metabolic  | Nonalcoholic Wernicke's encephalopathy  |  |\n|  | Osmotic myelinolysis  |  |\n| Infectious  | Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease  |  |\n|  | Cytomegalovirus  |  |\n|  | Cat-scratch disease  |  |\n|  | HIV  |  |\n|  | Post-infectious encephalitis  |  |\n|  | West Nile virus  |  |\n|  | Rabies virus  |  |\n|  | Cerebral malaria (Plasmodium falciparum)  |  |\n|  | Thalamic abscess (toxoplasmosis)  |  |\n|  | Japanese encephalitis  |  |\n| Vascular  | Artery of Percheron stroke  |  |\n|  | Deep cerebral vein thrombosis  |  |\n|  | Posterior reversible encephalopathy  |  |\n|  | Top of the basilar artery syndrome  |  |\n| Autoimmune  | Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis  |  |\n|  | Neurosarcoidosis  |  |\n|  | Vacuolar leukoencephalopathy (celiac disease)  |  |\n|  | Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis (non-Hodgkin lymphoma)  |  |\n| Genetic  | Alpers disease  |  |\n|  | Leigh syndrome  |  |\n| Neoplastic  | Bilateral thalamic gliomas  |  |\n| MRI T1 hyperintensity  | Fabry disease  |  |\n|  | Krabbe disease  |  |\n|  | Profound hypoxia of the newborn  |  |\n|  | Fahr disease  |  |\n| DWl hyperintensity  | Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (status epileptic us)  |  |\n\n【30】MRI - magnetic resonance imaging； DW1- diffusion-weighted imaging.\n\n【31】Nonalcoholic WE remains a challenging diagnosis because of its diverse clinical presentations， myriad underlying etiologies， and a lack of standardized diagnostic laboratory tests. As re-ported， approximately 80% of cases of nonalcoholic WE are recognized only at autopsy . MRI signs in conjunction with clinical context can help clinicians make the correct diagno-sis promptly and initiate appropriate management. Clinicians and radiologists should be aware of the fact that isolated in-volvement of the medial thalami (pulvinar/hockey stick sign) can be the sole manifestation of WE.

Insulin treatment is usu-ally needed at some point in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity to achieve the target-ed glycemic control goal.\n\n【2】Case Report： A 35-year-old woman who had gastric banding for morbid obesity 1 year prior presented to the outpatient clin-ic with recent onset of shortness of breath and bilateral ankle edema， which were thought to be of cardiac ori-gin. Band slippage occurred a few months after the procedure， and the patient gained weight rapidly thereafter. She had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 8 years earlier， which was treated with oral hypoglyce-mic medication. Thyroid function tests done 4 months prior to her current presentation revealed normal re-sults. A cardiac assessment showed normal cardiac function with no evidence of heart failure. Repeated thy-roid function testing showed new-onset subclinical hypothyroidism. The patient had started insulin therapy 2weeks before her current presentation， which was probably the main cause of her edema. While continuing in-sulin， the patient’s general condition improved with diuretics therapy， following which she had gastric bypasssurgery.\n\n【3】Conclusions： Insulin-induced edema is an under-diagnosed problem. It should be considered whenever a patient with un-controlled diabetes develops rapid body swelling after initiation of ins ulin therapy. Rigorous research is need-ed to explore the pathophysiology， prevalence， and treatment of insulin-induced edema.\n\n【4】Keywords： Bariatric Surgery ·Diabetes Mellitus·Obesity·Edema\n\n【5】Edema， peripheral or generalized， is a rare complication of in-sulin therapy， which mostly occurs after initiating intensive insulin treatment in patients with newly diagnosed or poor-ly controlled diabetes . Cases of this rare condition have continued to emerge even in recent years ， despite vast improvements in the chemistry and manufacture of insulin molecules.\n\n【6】We present here a rare case showing the overlap of symptoms and signs in a patient with obesity and diabetes who started insulin therapy. Of note， the cause of weight gain in this patient could be intuitively explained by the failure of gastric banding； however， this should not prevent searching for other possible causes of generalized edema. Since insulin-induced edema is a diagnosis of exclusion， it can take a relatively long time to be established. Nevertheless， it should always be considered when no obvious cause of edema is found in such patients.\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】A 35-year-old woman was admitted to the general medical ward with generalized body swelling occurring over a few days. She had morbid obesity (body mass index of 54.8 kg/m2) and had been diagnosed with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus 8 years before， but her diabetic state was poorly con-trolled during the last year. Gastric banding was performed 1year prior to her presentation； however， the procedure failed a few months later because of band slippage. The failure of gastric banding combined with poorly controlled ddiiabetes， pertension， and morbid obesity had necessitated the consid-eration of gastric bypass surgery.\n\n【9】The patient had been visiting the medical outpatient clinic regularly for routine investigations and revision of her med-ications. At her last visit， 2 weeks prior to presentation， her medications were metformin 1g twice daily， gliclazide 120mg (modified release tablets) once daily before breakfast， si-tagliptin 50 mg once daily， valsartan 160 mg once daily， rosu-vastatin 10 mg once daily at bedtime， and ranitidine 300 mg once daily. Because her HbAlc was 12.3%， she was started on insulin glargine 50 units at bedtime in an attempt to achieve satisfactory glycemic control. The patient admitted that she was feeling well before starting insulin therapy， after which she immediately started to observe puffiness of her body and legs. She had no known allergy to specific drugs or allergens and was not on oral contraceptives. She was a stay-at-home mother with 1 child， a 7-year-old son， living with her. She did not smoke or drink alcohol. Her mother had obesity， with long-standing but well-controlled diabetes mellitus.\n\n【10】On examination， she weighed 130 kg； however， her weight 2weeks earlier was 122 kg. She looked slightly dyspneic， lying on the bed with 2 pillows under her head， with a respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min and oxygen saturation of 95% on ambient air. Her pulse rate was 108 beats/min (regular) and blood pres-sure was 146/85 mmHg. Her jugular venous pressure was not visible when she was lying at 45 degrees. Her first and second heart sounds were clearly audible， with no additional sounds. However， the patient had generalized pitting body edema， which was more evident in her lower limbs. There were neither visi-ble varicose veins nor cutaneous changes， and her edematous legs were neither hot nor tender to palpation. Breath sounds were normal to auscultation， with no audible crackles. The ab-domen was soft to palpation， the liver was palpable 2 cm be-low the costal margin without tenderness， and there was no distension， shifting dullness， or guarding of the abdomen. The neurological examination was within normal limits.\n\n【11】As the patient's main symptom was generalized body swell-ing， full laboratory investigations were done，revealing the re-sults shown in Table 1. The chest X-ray showed no evidence of congestive heart failure， cardiomegaly， or pericardial dis-ease. There were no significant electrocardiographic changes. Trans-thoracic echocardiography as well as Duplex ultrasound of the lower limbs showed normal results.\n\n【12】The differential diagnoses of generalized edema considered in this patient included the following： congestive heart failure； constrictive pericarditis； obstructive sleep apnea with pulmo-nary hypertension； renal failure； atypical nephrotic syndrome； hepatic diseases， including liver cirrhosis and Budd-Chiari syn-drome； protein losing enteropathy； pretibial myxedema (hy-pothyroidism)； insulin-induced edema； and idiopathic edema.\n\n【13】The cardiac， renal， and hepatic causes were easily excluded from the differential diagnosis based on the clinical examina-tion findings and results of the investigations that were car-ried out in the preliminary workup. Idiopathic edema usual-ly occurs in women who are premenstrual. Although it is also called cyclic edema， it has no relationship with the menstrual cycle but has a characteristic diurnal pattern with remarkable body weight variations throughout the day . A difference of body weight of more than 1.4 kg in 1 day is considered the key diagnostic feature ofthis condition. It usually requires di-uretic therapy for a relatively long duration and usually recurs upon withholding the treatment . However， a rapid weight gain of 8 kg in 2 weeks after initiation of insulin therapy in our patient， with a complete resolution after a short-term di-uretic therapy， could not be attributed to idiopathic edema.\n\n【14】The new onset of generalized pitting edema in this patient with diabetes could not be explained by the encountered hy-pothyroidism， as the latter manifests by non-pitting edema，\n\n【15】Table 1.

The other medications that the patient had been taking were continued regularly， including insulin.\n\n【19】One week after admission， the edema subsided without the need of further diuretic treatment， and the patient felt well. She was weighed daily， and a reduction of her body weight to123 kg occurred and remained stable without additional di-uretic therapy. Repeated laboratory investigations showed no significant changes compared with index admission， but her albumin level increased from 30 to 37 gm/L A diagnosis of insulin-induced edema was made， with a probable diagnosis of new-onset subclinical hypothyroidism. However， thyroxine therapy was not started during her hospital stay. A multidis-ciplinary team， consisting of an endocrinologist， cardiologist， dietitian， bariatric surgeon， and psychologist， was assigned to prepare the patient for bariatric surgery， when the patient’s condition allowed.\n\n【20】Five months later， the patient underwent Roux-en-Y gastric by-pass surgery. Thereafter， she stopped receiving insulin therapy， as her body weight started to decrease， and her last weight measurement 2 weeks prior to her last visit was 103 kg. She was maintained on thyroxine tablets 75 microgram once daily after confirmation of hypothyroidism， with a TSH levelexceed-ing 10 mlU/L on repeated tests. Her glycemic control seemed to improve， with a HbA1c of 7.4%. A schematic presentationof the timeline of the various pathologies， interventions and outcomes are shown in Figure 1.\n\n【21】Discussion\n\n【22】In the present case of a female patient with a history of poor-ly controlled diabetes， insulin-induced edema was the best acceptable explanation of the rapid onset of edema that oc-curred immediately after the initiation of insulin therapy. Interestingly， most of the reported cases with insulin-induced edema were in female patients with underweight， while this patient had morbid obesity.\n\n【23】Insulin-induced edema (or insulin edema) is a rare condition with a development of rapid generalized edema immediately after receiving insulin therapy. It commonly occurs in individ-uals who are newly diagnosed with diabetes or in those with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes； it is usually a self-limiting con-dition but can recur or progress to frank congestive heart fail-ure . It tends to occur in Black women with underweight and can be associated with low albumin levels and/or de-ranged liver function . It can also occur in patients with type 1 diabetes when they start insulin therapy， regardless of their glycemic control. It was first described by Leifer in 1928in a middle-aged man who presented with diabetic ketoaci-dosis. Leifer suggested that prompt fluid retention is mainly due to the rapid deposition of glycogen in response to initia-tion of insulin therapy .\n\n【24】The pathophysiology of insulin-induced edema has not been fully understood， and it seems that this disorder is under-re-ported， as observed by the limited number of published reports. It is proposed that the anti-natriuretic effect of insulin plays an important role in the mechanism of fluid retention through its significant influence on the transport of electrolytes in the kidney . It appears that it increases tubular sodium reten-tion in the kidney， and transient hyperaldosteronism coupled with hyperglycemia might enhance this effect， particularly in patients with uncontrolled diabetes . This anti-natriuretic action of insulin as a salt-retaining hormone is now unambigu-ous. It is associated with obesity and hypertension through its direct effect on extracellular volume expansion， leading even-tually to volume-loading hypertension . Another theory is that insulin-induced edema may be due to a genetic disor-ders， particularly mitochondrial disorders， such as mitochon-drial tRNA mutation at position 3243 . However， the results of these observations are inconclusive， and further studies are needed to confirm or rule out these associations.\n\n【25】There is no consensus on how to treat insulin-induced edema. Most physicians and endocrinologists adopt a conservative man-agement approach， and most cases respond to this method of treatment. This could be mainly because the majority of cases are diagnosed retrospectively， after exclusion of other disorders with a similar clinical picture. Fluid restriction is important and can be the only treatment measure that is needed in some cases.\n\n【26】Diuretics have been used in the treatment of insulin-induced edema with good results in the majority of patients. Their use could be justified by the fact that insulin is a salt-retaining drug；", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

In the majority of cases， they are related to infections and volume overload. Medications have also been report-ed to cause pleural effusion in the general population， albeit very rarely. Dasatinib-induced pleural effusion has been reported in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia but not in those with HSCT. We here report a case of dasatinib-induced pleural effusion following HSCT for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). The proposed mech-anism of dasatinib-induced pleural effusion involves build-up of fluid due to an immune-mediated vascular insult.\n\n【2】Case Report： A 72-year-old man who received HSCT for ALL was treated with dasatinib to prevent a recurrence. After 6months， the patient was admitted to the hospital for pneumonia， which was observed as bilateral pleural ef-fusion upon chest X-ray. After completing the antibiotics course， he developed recurrent pleural effusion dur-ing hospitalization. Repeated thoracentesis of the fluid revealed an exudative lymphocytic effusion with neg-ative culture and cytology. Dasatinib was withdrawn and the pleural effusion resolved gradually.\n\n【3】Conclusions：\n\n【4】In patients with dasatinib-induced pleural effusions following HCTS， withdrawal of the drug leads to symptom resolution， thereby avoiding unnecessary procedures. This case illustrates that dasatinib-induced pleural dis-ease typically manifests with lymphocytic exudative fluid. Physicians should be aware that pleural effusion is a possible medication-related adverse effect， which may be missed in cases of infection in patients following HSCT.\n\n【5】Keywords： Bone Marrow Transplantation·Dasatinib·Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions·Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation· Medication Reconciliation· Pleural EffusionPleural effusions are common in patients who are undergo ing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)， with a re-ported incidence of approximately 10% based on a large ret-rospective study . The common causes of pleural effusion are infection and volume overload. Rare causes of pleural effu sion include malignancy and graft versus host disease (GVHD). Medication-induced pleural effusion among patients undergo-ing HSCT has not been reported previously. Nevertheless， there is a higher incidence of pleural effusion in patients that are taking medications such as tacrolimus and mycophenolate as prophylaxis against GVHD J.\n\n【6】The incidence of dasatinib-induced pleural effusion in chron-ic myeloid leukemia (CML) ranges from 15-30% . Dasatinib was first approved to treat CML but can also be used to prevent acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) relapse following HSCT . Here， we report a case of dasatinib-induced recurrent pleural effusion in a patient with ALL following HSCT. To the best of our knowledge，this is the first case of this adverse effect in a patient who has undergone HSCT.\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】A 72-year-old man was diagnosed with Philadelphia chromo-some-positive B-type ALL， through the detection of the pe-ripheral BCR-ABL1 fusion gene via fluorescence in situ hybrid-ization (FISH). The finding of more than 90% of blast cells in a bone marrow biopsy supported this diagnosis. The patient was initially treated with dasatinib and a hyperfractionated course of chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide， vincristine， doxo-rubicin， and dexamethasone)； however， this treatment was cut short due to infection. Dasatinib was continued with 1 cycle of POMP (6-mercaptopurine， vincristine， methotrexate， and prednisone)， followed by 5 cycles of intrathecal chemotherapyAfter treatment with dasatinib and during HSCT， the patient's cerebral spinal fluid findings were normal， and no BCR/ABL fusion gene was detected in his peripheral blood. The patient then underwent myeloablative HSCT with a mismatched 7/8unrelated donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant using a conditioning regimen (fludarabine， cyclophosphamide， total body irradiation) followed by postsurgical cyclophosphamide with sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. Dasatinib was re-sumed 4 months before presentation， and he had undetect-ed BCR/ABL 2 weeks prior to admission.\n\n【9】Six months after HSCT， the patient presented with a 10-day history of worsening shortness of breath and a cough. He did not report any orthopnea，paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea， leg edema， or weight change. He also had a fever that had startedthe previous day. No complications following HSCT were not-ed during periodic follow-up visits to an oncologist. He was a nonsmoker with no history of congestive heart failure or tu-berculosis. His home medications included dasatinib (100 mg orally daily)， sirolimus (1 mg orally daily)， and acyclovir (one400-mg oral tablet daily). His vaccinations were up to date， and he had recently received a Hemophilus influenzae and a Pneumovax vaccine.\n\n【10】On physical clinical examination， the patient was febrile with a temperature of 39.5℃. He had tachycardia， tachypnea， and mild hypoxia with oxygen saturation of 89% on room air； there was no leg edema. He had bilateral course crackles with poor air entry bilaterally. His abdomen was soft on palpation and no ascites were noted.\n\n【11】Blood tests indicated a hemoglobin level of 10.5 gm/dL， mild acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL， and mild elevation of his liver enzyme levels. A chest radiograph and chest computed tomography  showed a bi-lateral pleural effusion with possible left-sided infiltration or pneumonia. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed nor-mal left ventricular function with a small pericardial effusion. Pneumonia， bilateral pleural effusion， and small pericardial ef-fusion were diagnosed in the patient. He was started on treat-ment with broad-spectrum antibiotics， including vancomycin(1.5 mg every 12 h)， cefepime (1 mg intravenously every 8 h)， and metronidazole (500 mg intravenously every 8 h) for cov-erage of anerobic bacteria.\n\n【12】The patient's fever resolved on the second day of hospital-ization， and his symptoms improved. His creatinine and liv-er enzyme levels also improved. However， he had significant hypoxia with an increased oxygen requirement. Bilateral tho racentesis was performed to drain the pleural fluid， with ap-proximately 1.5 L of fluid drained from each side. The results of the analysis of the pleural fluid are summarized in Table 1. The patient received a diagnosis of left-sided pneumonia and a bilateral exudative pleural effusion according to Light's cri-teria  with lymphocytic predominance. The pleural fluid culture and cytology were negative. All investigations for infection， including a blood culture， serum Legionella an-tigen test， serum streptococcal antigen test， cytomegalovirus polymerase chain reaction， Histoplasma antigen test， and a-B-d-glucan test， yielded negative results.\n\n【13】Despite completing a 5-day course of antibiotics， the patient continued to require oxygen supplementation； therefore， we decided to repeat the chest computed tomography， which showed reaccumulation of the pleural fluid， predominantly on the right side. Therapeutic thoracentesis was performed.\n\n【14】Given this reaccumulation of the exudative pleural effusion after completing a course of antibiotics， we suspected medi-cation-induced fluid accumulation as the cause of the recur-rent pleural effusion and possible small pericardial effusion in the echocardiogram. The patient was on sirolimus， acyclovir，\n\n【15】Table 1.

Although any of these drugs could potential-ly cause pleural effusion， we decided to stop dasatinib first because patients treated with dasatinib had the highest in-cidence of pleural effusion. Since the patient was in remis-sion with no ABL/BCR fusion detected， an alternative tyrosine kinase inhibitor was not deemed necessary. After dasatinib was withdrawn， oral prednisone of 40 mg daily was initiated.\n\n【18】The patient was discharged from the hospital without requir-ing oxygen， and his chest X-ray on discharge date showed no signs of pleural effusion . A repeat echocardiogram2 weeks later upon the patient's follow-up with his primary oncologist showed trivial pericardial effusion. Given the un-detectable BCR/ABL， dasatinib was still withheld at this time. He had no complaints or abnormal laboratory test results in the following 6 months of follow-up.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】Pleural effusion following bone marrow transplantation can be classified as early onset (less than 100 days following HSCT) or late onset (more than 100 days following HSCT) effusion. Infections and volume overload can cause pleural effusion in either period， but they are more common with ear-ly-onset pleural effusion . Engraftment syndrome is more commonly associated with early-onset pleural effusion， where-as serositis caused by GVHD is more common in late-onset pleural effusion. Fluid overload is the most common noninfec-tious cause of pleural effusion . Chronic GVHD can manifest as a polyserositis-like pericardial effusion with pleural effusion and ascites . Hepatic veno-occlusive disease， a clinical syn-drome that can occur in patients who have undergone che-motherapy and radiation therapy， is characterized by jaundice， abdominal pain， and hyperbilirubinemia， and it can be com-plicated by multiorgan failure and a polyserositis-like pleural effusion . Malignant pleural effusion is rare after HSCT， but it can be seen in refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma .\n\n【21】Drug-related pleural disease is a rare cause of pleural effu-sion， in general， and it has not been reported in patients whohave undergone HSCT until now. Many medications can cause exudative pleural effusions， with the exception of cardiovas-cular medications， which can cause transudative pleural effu-sions . The possible mechanisms of drug-related pleural dis-ease could be a direct toxic effect， allergic reaction， or chemical inflammation . Drug-induced effusions are usually bilater-al and dose related. Some medications such as valproic acid can cause an eosinophilic pleural effusion， and other medica-tions such as dasatinib can cause lymphocytosis. Most drug-induced pleural effusions resolve after the causative medica-tion is stopped .\n\n【22】Several medications that can cause pleural effusion in HCST patients such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in-hibitors (eg， sirolimus) to prevent GVHD  or mycopheno-late or tyrosine kinase inhibitors (eg， dasatinib).\n\n【23】Our patient was taking 3 medications that can potentially cause pleural effusion： acyclovir， sirolimus， and dasatinib . Fluid accumulation-like pleural effusion has been described as a possible adverse effect of mTOR inhibitors such as everoli-mus and sirolimus. The possible mechanisms include inhibi-tion of lymphangiogenesis by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor， which is responsible for endothelial lymphat-ic proliferation .\n\n【24】There has been 1 case of a patient treated with acyclovir who presented with fever and， upon chest X-ray， showed pleuraleffusion and pulmonary infiltrates . The cause of the con-dition was diagnosed by exclusion of infections and pulmo-nary embolism， and the pleural effusion resolved after acy-clovir was stopped.\n\n【25】Dasatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is used to treat CML and Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL to prevent relapse . Dasatinib typically causes exudative pleural effu-sion similar to that caused by infections and can therefore be missed. A common reaction to dasatinib is fluid accumulation. which may present as pleural effusion， pericardial effusion， or ascites . Pleural effusion is found in 10-35% of CML pa-tients taking dasatinib， and the risk increases with high-dose and high-frequency administration . Dasatinib-associated pleural effusion is typically exudative with lymphocytic pre-dominance . Chylothorax is a less common complication of dasatinib therapy .\n\n【26】The mechanism of dasatinib-induced pleural effusion is un-clear， but it is related to the immune system based on obser-vational studies of patients with large granular lymphocytosis， both in the peripheral blood and in the pleural effusion， which were identified as natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells . However， these observational studies were conducted on pa-tients with CML and not on patients who had undergone HSCT. Another possible pathophysiological mechanism could be sec-ondary to tyrosine kinase inhibitors inhibiting platelet-derived growth factor， which is normally involved in angiogenesis and maintaining vessel integrity. Leaky vessels could be a possible histological mechanism underlying fluid accumulation .\n\n【27】The risk factors for dasatinib-induced pleural effusion in CML have been investigated. In general， the incidence of dasatinib-induced pleural effusion is higher in patients with a history of cardiac disease， pre-existing autoimmune disease， or a rash while on therapy . We propose additional risk factors， as illustrated by patients on mTOR inhibitors and mycophenolate in addition to dasatinib following HSCT being at higher risk.\n\n【28】The main treatment options for effusions include dose reduc-tion， temporary drug interruption， or switching to an alterna-tive tyrosine kinase inhibitor . Therapy withdrawal after pneumonia treatment is the primary recommendation in the context of recurrent pleural effusion. Therefore， in the present case， we decided to stop dasatinib， as it is associated with a higher incidence of pleural effusion than sirolimus. Additionally， we did not try to decrease the dose or use alternative tyro-sine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib or bosutinib， since the patient's ALL was in remission with no BCR/ABL fusion gene detected in FISH. Thoracentesis is strongly recommended in patients with massive bilateral pleural effusions with hypox-ia  and to exclude alternative causes， especially in patients with a high risk of infection secondary to recent HSCT， as inthe present case. Steroids may be beneficial，especially in pa-tients with mild to moderate effusions， but diuretics appear to be ineffective .\n\n【29】In our patient， the diagnosis of dasatinib-induced recurrent pleural effusion was suspected after we treated infections and excluded continuing infection and malignancy as possible causes by means of analysis of pleural fluid obtained through thoracentesis. The patient's exudative lymphocyte-predomi-nant pleuraleffusion was attributed to dasatinib； however， his triglyceride level in the pleural fluid was not tested to exclude chylothorax. We stopped dasatinib therapy because of recur-rent pleural effusion. The patient's condition improved signif-icantly， and he was discharged without oxygen requirement.\n\n【30】Conclusions\n\n【31】Although pleural effusion is a known complication of allogenic HSCT， drug-induced pleural effusion in patients who have un-dergone HSCT has not been described previously. Dasatinib-induced pleural effusion in HCST patients may differ from the effusion that develops in CML patients based on the follow-ing 4 points. First， there is a wide range of causes of pleural effusion in HSCT compared with CML. Second， the risk of in-fection could be higher in HSCT than in CML； therefore， tho-racentesis is strongly suggested for patients who have un-dergone HSCT to exclude infection. Third， closer monitoring may be needed when patients start on tyrosine kinase inhib-itors following HSCT. Fourth， complete drug withdrawal rath-er than dose reduction or use of alternative tyrosine kinase inhibitors could be appropriate in HSCT patients if ALL is in remission. This case demonstrates that it is also important to consider drugs as a cause of recurrent effusion following HSCT. Physicians may not be aware of the potential for drug-induced pleural disease because new drugs are continuous-ly being introduced and there is limited clinical experience or knowledge about their adverse effects. Therefore， accurate medication reconciliation by reviewing home medications and adverse effects can prevent patients with pleural disease from undergoing unnecessary procedures such as drainage using an indwelling pleural catheter and could minimize the dura-tion of hospital stay after the common causes of pleural effu-sion have been eliminated.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

The safety， pharmacokinetics， and pharmacodynamics of single and multiple doses of RLS-0071 were evaluated in a first-in-human clinical trial in healthy volunteers.Myeloperoxidase is the major peroxidase enzyme present in neutrophilic granules and contributes to cellular inflammation. Extracellular myeloperoxidase has been as-sociated with chronic inflammation in a variety of diseases， including atherosclerosis. RLS-0071 has previously been shown to inhibit extracellular myeloperoxidase function both in vitro and in vivo in animal disease models. Healthy subjects participating in the RLS-0071-101 study were screened for baseline myeloperoxidase level， leading to the identification of a 21-year-old woman with elevated baseline levels. After randomization， the subject received 9 intravenous infusions of 10 mg/kg RLS-0071. The subject tolerated the peptide infusions well with no adverse changes in vital signs， significantly abnormal clinical laboratory results， or severe adverse events. Analysis of this subject’s myeloperoxidase plasma concentrations demonstrated that her myeloperoxi-dase levels decreased by 43% and myeloperoxidase activity levels decreased 49% after infusions of RLS-0071. The reduction in the patient's plasma myeloperoxidase levels demonstrated a partial return to baseline levels 24hours after cessation of dosing. There were no other clinically meaningful safety observations for this subject. This observation suggests RLS-0071 has the therapeutic potential to moderate plasma myeloperoxidase levels and activity and modulate diseases in which myeloperoxidase contributes to pathogenesis.

RLS-0071， previously referred to as Peptide Inhibitor of Complement C1 (PIC1)， is a dual-targeting peptide being developed for clinical use to moderate humoral and cel-lular inflammation via inhibition of complement activation and neutrophil effectors . This 15-amino acid peptide， origi-nally derived from a region of the astrovirus coat protein， is noted to have limited homology with complement regulatory peptides . RLS-0071 was subsequently discovered to inhib-it myeloperoxidase activity in cystic fibrosis sputa ex vivo . Mechanistically， the peptide inhibits myeloperoxidase's heme ring， which is the enzymatic core， with potency equivalent to ABAH (4-Aminobenzoic acid hydrazide)， the criterion standard for myeloperoxidase inhibition， on a molar basis  .\n\n【6】Myeloperoxidase contributes to the pathogenesis of certain autoimmune diseases like ANCA-associated vasculitis and chronic inflammatory conditions such as atherosclerosis . In atherosclerosis， elevated levels of myeloperoxidase are as-sociated with an increased risk for future major adverse car-diac events (MACEs) such as myocardial infarction or heart failure . Humans that are otherwise asymptomatic are con-sidered at increased risk of developing future MACEs if they have a plasma myeloperoxidase level of >322 pmol/L.\n\n【7】Although the subjects in the RLS-0071-101 study were healthy and relatively young， we identified a subject with higher-than-average plasma myeloperoxidase level measured at baseline. During the study， we enrolled 54 subjects and identified 1 indi-vidual with an elevated baseline myeloperoxidase level among those that received multiple doses of RLS-0071.While the ab-solute myeloperoxidase level was not high enough to consider her at risk for MACEs， it was noticeably elevated when com-pared to the remainder of the study cohort. We postulated that RLS-0071 dosing might lead to changes in myeloperoxidase level， functional activity， or both in that individual .\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】The study was conducted at Altasciences in Canada between January 2021 and August 2021. It was conducted in accordance with the guidelines described in the Declaration of Helsinki and the CIOMS International Ethical and ICH GCP Guidelines. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the local com-petent Regulatory Authority and Institutional Review Board. The study protocol was approved by Health Canada control number 249562. All participants signed written consent forms.\n\n【10】Subject 1504 was a healthy 21-year-old white woman (weight61 kg， height 167 cm， and BMI of 21.7) at the time of enroll-ment in April 2021. Her only medication was an intrauter-ine contraception device， and she had no underlying chronic medical conditions. Subject 1504 received 9 intravenous in-fusions of RLS-0071 each at a dose of 10 mg/kg. The only ad-verse events reported for this subject were mild bruising at the sites of venipuncture. The bruising resolved as expected and was deemed to not be associated with the drug.\n\n【11】Vital signs， including temperature， heart rate， blood pressure， respirations， and oxygen saturations， remained normal through-out the study. The only laboratory abnormalities observed were a mildly low plasma protein concentration on Day 2， 62 g/L， and Day 4， 58 g/L (reference range of 63-80 g/l). The plas-ma protein returned to the baseline range by Day 6 . This pattern of transient， mild hypoproteinemia was seen in most subjects dosed with either active drug or placebo and was attributed to the frequent phlebotomy that occurred dur-ing the first several days of the study， needed to characterize their pharmacokinetic profiles. No other lab abnormalities oc-curred for this subject on blood chemistries， complete blood counts， or coagulation studies. Likewise， she did not devel-op any antidrug antibodies and her autoantibody panel test-ing was negative at screening and remained negative through Day 30 post-infusion. The autoantibody panel included： anti-double stranded DNA， antinuclear antibodies， Cardiolipin IgG， Cardiolipin IgM， Ribonucleoprotein antibody， Sjogren SS-A an-tibody， Sjogren SS-B antibody， and Smith antibody . Additional tests that were negative included： HIV， Hepatitis B， Hepatitis C， COVID-19， pregnancy， and drug screen. Urinalysis tests during the study were normal except for trace ketones on Day 1 and Day 2， as well as trace occult blood on Day 2， which resolved by Day 4. The subject was discharged from the Phase 1 unit on Day 6 and was determined to be in good health upon routine follow-up on Day 30.\n\n【12】Blood was collected by venipuncture into K，EDTA tubes (BD) and placed into a wet ice bath. Tubes were centrifuged at 4℃\n\n| Category  | Test (unit)  | Visit  | Result (flag)  | Clinical significance  | Normal reference range  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| biochemistry  |  | Screening  | 71  |  | 63-80  |\n| General  | Protein  | Day 2  | 62(L)  | NCS  | 63-80  |\n|  | (g/L)  | Day 4  | 58(L)  | NCS  | 63-80  |\n| Urinalysis  |  | Day 6  | 64  |  | 63-80  |\n| Urinalysis  |  | Screening  | Negative  |  | Negative  |\n| Urinalysis  | Ketones  | Day 1  | Trace (A)  | NCS  | Negative  |\n| Urinalysis  | (mmol/L)  | Day 2  | Trace (A)  | NCS  | Negative  |\n| Urinalysis  |  | Day 4  | Negative  |  | Negative  |\n| Urinalysis  |  | Screening  | Moderate (A)  | NCS  | Negative  |\n| Urinalysis  | Occult blood  | Day 2  | Trace (A)  | NCS  | Negative  |\n| Urinalysis  |  | Day 4  | Negative  |  | Negative  |\n| Urinalysis  | Protein-urines  | Screening  | Trace (A)  | NCS  | Negative  |\n|  | (g/L)  | Day 4  | Negative  |  | Negative  |\n\n【14】NCS - not clinically significant； A - abnormal； L-low.\n\n【15】and plasma was recovered， aliquoted， and frozen at -20℃. Frozen plasma samples were shipped on dry ice to ReAlta Life Sciences (Norfolk， VA). To quantify the amount of endogenous myeloperoxidase， plasma was analyzed using a human myelo-peroxidase ELISA kit (BMS2038INST， Invitrogen). To determine myeloperoxidase activity in the plasma， subject samples were analyzed using a fluorescence-based myeloperoxidase assay kit (K745-100， BioVision). Approximately 2 uL of the plasma sample was incubated in the kit’s master mix for 20 minutes at 37°C and read at Ex/Em=353/387 nm.\n\n【16】The subject's plasma samples were measured for myeloper-oxidase concentration utilizing a commercial kit as described above. One subject was identified with an elevated myelo-peroxidase concentration of 142 pmol/L at baseline . Assays were performed in 3 independent experiments for each sample. The plasma myeloperoxidase concentration de-creased from baseline by approximately 43% after 8 doses of RLS-0071 (pre-dose 9). The myeloperoxidase level decreased slightly after the 9ih dose at end of infusion and 1 hour later. The myeloperoxidase level recovered approximately 26% to-wards pre-first dose baseline 24 hours after the final dose. In summary， these data demonstrate a mildly elevated baseline plasma myeloperoxidase concentration that decreased after multiple doses of RLS-0071 and then partially recovered to baseline 24 hours after cessation of dosing.\n\n【17】The subject's plasma samples were also measured for myelo-peroxidase activity in a functional myeloperoxidase assay， in which the peroxidase activity of myeloperoxidase was mea-sured using a fluorescence-based myeloperoxidase assay kit. The plasma myeloperoxidase activity level decreased from baseline by 49% after 8 doses of RLS-0071 (pre-dose9). After the 9th dose of RLS-0071， further decreases in activ-ity were measured at end of infusion (26%) and 1 hour lat-er (46%) compared with pre-dose 9 myeloperoxidase activity levels. At 24 hours after the last dose of RLS-0071 (9th dose)， the myeloperoxidase activity level had increased to nearly the pre-9th dose level. In summary， these data demonstrate an ele-vated baseline plasma myeloperoxidase activity level that de-creased after multiple doses of RLS-0071， decreased further immediately after dosing， and then partially recovered to pre-9th dose baseline after 24 hours.\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】Although healthy and asymptomatic， the moderate elevation of plasma myeloperoxidase in this subject suggests that she had a subclinical inflammatory process of unknown origin. After 9 doses of RLS-0071 at 10 mg/kg administered intrave-nously every 8 hours， myeloperoxidase levels and myeloper-oxidase activity had both decreased， likely reflecting modera-tion of the underlying inflammatory process by RLS-0071.After the 9ih dose of RLS-0071， further decreases in myeloperoxidaseactivity were measured at end of infusion and 1 hour after the dose， but myeloperoxidase levels were unchanged. This is consistent with the mechanism of action of RLS-0071， which rapidly inhibits myeloperoxidase enzymatic activity. Thus， af-ter a dose of RLS-0071， the concentration of myeloperoxidase should not change， but activity of circulating myeloperoxi-dase should be inhibited. The partial return of plasma myelo-peroxidase activity 24 hours after the final dose is consistent with the short in-blood half-life of RLS-0071 of approximately2.7 hours . Likewise， the partial return to baseline of plasma myeloperoxidase concentration 24 hours after the last dose is also explained by the short half-life of the compound.\n\n| Visit  | Test (unit)  | Result  | Normal reference range  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Screening Day -1  | Anti-double stranded DNA (IU/mL)  | <1  | 0-4  |\n| Screening Day -1  | Antinuclear antibodies  | Negative  |  |\n| Screening Day -1  | Cardiolipin IgG antibody (U/mL)  | <1.6  | 0-20  |\n| Screening Day -1  | Cardiolipin IgM antibody (U/mL)  | <0.2  | 0-20  |\n| Screening Day -1  | Ribonucleoprotein antibody (Al)  | 0.2  | 0-1  |\n| Screening Day -1  | Sjogren's SS-A antibody (Al)  | <0.2  | 0-1  |\n| Screening Day -1  | Sjogren's SS-B antibody (Al) Smith antibody (Al) Antidrug antibody Antidrug antibody  | <0.2 <0.2 Negative Negative  | 0-1 0-1  |\n| Screening Day -1  | Sjogren's SS-B antibody (Al) Smith antibody (Al) Antidrug antibody Antidrug antibody  | <0.2 <0.2 Negative Negative  | 0-1 0-1  |\n| Screening Day -1  | Sjogren's SS-B antibody (Al) Smith antibody (Al) Antidrug antibody Antidrug antibody  | <0.2 <0.2 Negative Negative  | 0-1 0-1  |\n| Screening Day -1  | Sjogren's SS-B antibody (Al) Smith antibody (Al) Antidrug antibody Antidrug antibody  | <0.2 <0.2 Negative Negative  | 0-1 0-1  |\n| Screening Day -1  | Sjogren's SS-B antibody (Al) Smith antibody (Al) Antidrug antibody Antidrug antibody  | <0.2 <0.2 Negative Negative  | 0-1 0-1  |\n| Screening Day -1  | Sjogren's SS-B antibody (Al) Smith antibody (Al) Antidrug antibody Antidrug antibody  | <0.2 <0.2 Negative Negative  | 0-1 0-1  |\n| Screening Day -1  | Sjogren's SS-B antibody (Al) Smith antibody (Al) Antidrug antibody Antidrug antibody  | <0.2 <0.2 Negative Negative  |  |\n| Screening Day -1  | Sjogren's SS-B antibody (Al) Smith antibody (Al) Antidrug antibody Antidrug antibody  | <0.2 <0.2 Negative Negative  |  |\n| Screening Day -1  | Anti-double stranded DNA (IU/mL)  | <1  | 0-4  |\n| Screening Day -1  | Antinuclear antibodies  | Negative  |  |\n|  | Cardiolipin IgG antibody (U/mL)  | <1.6  | 0-20  |\n| Day 6  | Cardiolipin IgM antibody (U/mL)  | <0.2  | 0-20  |\n|  | Ribonucleoprotein antibody (Al)  | 0.2  | 0-1  |\n|  | Sjogren’s SS-A antibody (Al)  | <0.2  | 0-1  |\n|  | Sjogren's SS-B antibody (AI)  | <0.2  | 0-1  |\n|  | Smith antibody (Al)  | <0.2  | 0-1  |\n|  | Anti-double stranded DNA (IU/mL)  | <1  | 0-4  |\n|  | Antidrug antibody  | Negative  |  |\n|  | Antinuclear antibodies  | Negative  |  |\n|  | Cardiolipin IgG antibody (U/mL)  | <1.6  | 0-20  |\n| \\*Follow-up  | Cardiolipin IgM antibody (U/mL)  | <0.2  | 0-20  |\n|  | Ribonucleoprotein antibody (Al)  | 0.2  | 0-1  |\n|  | Sjogren’s SS-A antibody (AI)  | <0.2  | 0-1  |\n|  | Sjogren's SS-B antibody (Al)  | <0.2  | 0-1  |\n|  | Smith antibody (Al)  | <0.2  | 0-1  |\n\n【21】\\* Follow-up visit： Up to 27 days after discharge on Day 6 (Day 30±3 days， Day 27 through Day 33).\n\n【22】Table 3.

The decrease in myeloperoxidase level， as well as activity， suggests that RLS-0071 is inhibiting the under-lying inflammatory condition that is leading to the elabora-tion of extracellular myeloperoxidase. This subject was young and apparently healthy， so the underlying inflammatory con-dition was occult. However， young and healthy individuals can have elevated plasma myeloperoxidase levels due to un-derlying unrecognized atheromatous disease and likely oth-er processes that have yet to manifest as illness. It is unclear at this time whether the current initial intravenous formula-tion of RLS-0071 would be logistically feasible for treatment of chronic conditions like atherosclerosis due to the whole-body half-life of approximately 24 hours. Initial clinical trials for this formulation will focus on the treatment of acute in-flammatory conditions in which myeloperoxidase has been shown to play a prominent role in pathogenesis. Development of formulations that are better for treating chronic inflamma-tory conditions is a future goal.\n\n【26】Taken together， these data show temporal correlations for RLS-0071 decreasing both myeloperoxidase concentration， as well as myeloperoxidase activity level after multiple doses， andsuggests that RLS-0071 can have a measurable effect on my-eloperoxidase in humans. Although further studies are need-ed to replicate these findings in other people with elevated myeloperoxidase plasma levels， these results suggest promise for RLS-0071 to moderate markers of underlying inflammato-ry states and potentially reduce the risk for attendant future major cardiovascular events.\n\n【27】Conclusions\n\n【28】This observation suggests RLS-0071 has therapeutic poten-tial to moderate plasma myeloperoxidase levels and activi-ty and modulate diseases in which myeloperoxidase contrib-utes to pathogenesis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

CML is usually diagnosed in the chronic phase. Blast crisis represents an advanced phase of CML. Extramedullary blast crisis as the initial presentation of CML with bone marrow remaining in chronic phase is an unusual event. Further， extramedullary blast crisis with T lymphoid/myeloid bilineal phenotype as an initial presentation for CML is extremely unusual.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】Here， we report the case of a 49-year-old male with rapidly enlarged submandibular lymph nodes. Biopsy specimen from the nodes revealed a characteristic appearance with morphologically and immunohistochemically distinct my-eloblasts and T lymphoblasts co-localized in 2 adjacent regions， accompanied by chronic phase of the disease in bone marrow. The presence of the BCR/ABL1 fusion gene within both cellular populations in this case confirmed the extramedullary disease represented a localized T lymphoid/myeloid bilineal blastic transformation of CML After3 courses of combined chemotherapy plus tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment， the mass was completely regressed with a 3-log decrease in BCR/ABL1 transcript from baseline. Five months after the diagnosis， the patient showed diminished vision， hand tremors， and weakness of lower extremities. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping of ce-rebrospinal fluid revealed the presence of myeloid blasts. An isolated central nervous system relapse of leukemiawas identified. Following high-dose systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy， the patient continued to do well.\n\n【4】Conclusions\n\n【5】The possibility of extramedullary blast crisis as an initial presentation in patients with CML should be consid-ered. Further， an isolated central nervous system blast crisis should be considered if neurological symptomsevolve in patients who have shown a good response to therapy.\n\n【6】MeSH Keywords： Blast Crisis ·Leukemia， Myelogenous， Chronic， BCR-ABL Positive·\n\n【7】Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma · Sarcoma， Myeloid\n\n【8】Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloprolifera-tive disorder， which is characterized by the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome generated by the reciprocal translocation t(9：22)(q34；q11)that results in a BCR/ABL1 fusion gene . Blast cri-sis represents an advanced phase of the disease， arbitrarily de-fined as more than 30% of blasts in the blood or bone marrow. or the presence of extramedullary disease. However， extramed-ullary blast crisis as the initial presentation for CML with bone marrow remaining in the chronic phase has been reported in only 16 reported cases in the past 25 years . The lymph node is the most commonly involved site for the extramedul-lary disease. Immunophenotypic analysis of the blasts shows that 50% of cases with extramedullary disease are classified as myeloid phenotype， 25% as T lymphoid phenotype， and 25%as bilineal phenotype (myeloid and T cell). Surprisingly， no B lymphoid phenotype is reported among CML cases with extra-medullary blast crisis as the initial presentation. Previous re-ports indicated that T lymphoid phenotype is extremely rare， and B lymphoid phenotype (30%)， secondary only to myeloid phenotype (70%)， is another common immunophenotype of the blasts in blastic phase of CML cases .\n\n【9】In this report， we describe the case of a 49-year-old male with CML who presented with bilineal extramedullary (lymph nodes) blast crisis accompanied by chronic phase of disease in bone marrow， and who later developed an isolated central nervous system (CNS) relapse of leukemia. We also show that the extra-medullary blastic disease in this case had a characteristic path-ological feature with the Ph+ myeloblasts located adjacent to the Ph+ T lymphoblasts within the same involved lymph node.\n\n【10】A 49-year-old male was evaluated for rapidly enlarging mass on the left side of the neck at a local hospital in May 2015. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous needle aspiration biopsy of the mass showed the normal structure of tissue was obscure and replaced by diffused infiltration of atypical lymphocytes. Immunohistochemistry detection revealed that these lympho-cytes were positive for CD34， CD7， CD99， and Ki-67 (>50%)， scattered positive for TdT， but negative for PAX-5，CD33， CD64， CD3， CD20， and MPO. The histological diagnosis was precursor T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. Bone marrow aspirate smears revealed active hyperplasia， with 79.6% granulocytes (2.8% my-eloblasts， 6.8% early promyelocytic cells， 20.8% middle pro-myelocytic cells， and 14.4% late promyelocytic cells)， 15.2%erythropoietic cells， and 2.4% lymphocytes. Of these lympho-cytes， atypical lymphocytes were visible. The patient did not receive any treatment.\n\n【11】In June 2015， the patient was admitted to our hospital with complains of night sweating but no fever or weight loss. Physical examination revealed multiple palpable masses on the left side of the neck and submandibular area， with a maximum diameter of 3 cm. The liver and spleen were not palpable be-low the costal margin. Initial examination of peripheral blood counts showed moderate leukocytosis (20 900/ ul) with 9% mid-dle promyelocytic cells， 7% late promyelocytic cells， 53% neu-trophils， 1% basophils， 1% eosinophils， 19% lymphocytes， and10% monocytes. The repeated bone marrow aspirate smears revealed active hyperplasia with G/E ratio of 10.3：1. The lym-phocytes accounted for 12.4%， in which immature lymphocytes were unevenly distributed， with an average of 6.4% .\n\n【12】Flow cytometric immunophenotyping of bone marrow revealed abnormal proliferation of myeloid blasts， which were positive for CD34， HLA-DR，CD117，CD33， and CD7. Chromosome analy-sis identified presence of Ph chromosome in 20 out of 20 cells. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed positive staining for p210 BCR/ABL1 gene rearrangement in83% of interphase cells . The e13a2 BCR/ABL1  fusion transcript was confirmed by quantitative reverse tran-scriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis， show-ing a 16.7% proportion of BCR/ABL1 to ABL1 . There was no alteration in P53 gene. These findings led to the di-agnosis of chronic phase CML. 18F-FDG positron emission to-mography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scanning revealed abnormal FDG accumulation in multiple lymph nodes in the left side of the neck， with moderately high metabolic activity(SUV：7.0)， and high metabolic activity related to the mass in the left submandibular (SUVmax：14.5； Diametermax： 50 mm). A subsequent excisional biopsy of the left sub-mandibular lymph nodes was performed. Hematoxylin and eo-sin (H& E) staining revealed damaged structure of the nodes， and diffused infiltration of 2 populations of blasts with dis-tinct morphology . Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated simultaneous proliferation of blast populations of myeloid and lymphoid lineages in adjacent regions within the same lymph node. The myeloblasts were positive for my-eloid differentiation markers (MPO and lysozyme) but negative for CD5， CD3， CD99， CD117， CD34， and TdT， which was con-sistent with myeloid sarcoma. They were surrounded by lym-phoblasts positive for precursor lymphoid cell markers (CD34and CD99) and pan-T markers (CD5 and CD3)， but negative for MPO and lysozyme， consistent with T cell lymphoblastic lym-phoma . FISH test for p210 BCR/ABLl gene rear-rangement was positive in both cell populations . Therefore， the final diagnosis of Ph+ CML with a bilineal ex-tramedullary blast crisis of myeloid sarcoma and precursor T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma was made.\n\n【13】Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKl) imatinib and induction chemo-therapy using vincristine and prednisone was administered. After the initial course of chemotherapy， the enlarged left neck and submandibular nodes experienced a transient shrinkage before progressive re-enlargement. QRT-PCR monitoring of BCR/ABL1 transcript in bone marrow showed an increased ra-tio of BCR/ABL1 to ABL1 (35.6%)， but mutation of BCR/ABL1kinase domain was not detected by direct sequencing of PCR products. Another TKI， Nilotinib， and combination chemothera-py regimen consisting of mitoxantrone， etoposide， vincristine， prednisone was administered later. After 2 courses of chemo-therapy， the enlarged nodes were completely regressed， with a significant decrease of BCR/ABL1 transcript in bone marrow (the ratio of BCR/ABL1 to ABL1 was 0.03%)， which was confirmed by ultrasound examination and qRT-PCR， respectively. The patient refused the treatment recommendation of allogeneichematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) due to eco-nomic reasons. He was given routine prophylactic intrathecal treatment with cytarabine and dexamethasone from the be-ginning of the second course of chemotherapy. In November2015，he complained of diminished vision， hand tremors， and weakness of lower extremities， but no headache or vomiting. Brain MRI results were normal. Lumbar puncture examination showed markedly increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure(>30 cm H，O). Laboratory tests of CSF revealed significantly el-evated protein level (1716.3 mg/dl) and normal glucose level(4.4 mmol/L) and leukocyte counts (2x10/L). Flow cytomet-ric immunophenotyping of CSF confirmed presence of myeloid blasts positive for CD34 and HLA-DR， but negative for CD117and CD7. The diagnosis of CML with CNS blast crisis was con-firmed， and treatment initiated with intravenous high-dose methotrexate (3 g/m?， every 2 weeks) and intrathecal cytara-bine and dexamethasone (twice a week) was promptly given. Following treatment， the patient’s symptoms were relieved， with normal CSF pressure and negative laboratory test re-sults， and no detectable BCR/ABL1 transcript in bone marrow by qRT-PCR， and to date he continues to be well.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Here， we report an unusual case of CML that presented with an extramedullary nodal T lymphoid/myeloid bilineal blast cri-sis， followed by an isolated CNS relapse of leukemia. This case is unusual in 3 aspects： 1) bilineal extramedullary blast crisis as an initial presentation for CML with bone marrow remain-ing in chronic phase； 2) extramedullary disease with morpho-logically and immunophenotypically distinct cell populations distributed in 2 adjacent regions of the same involved lymph node； and 3) isolated CNS relapse after standard therapy with an initial good response.\n\n【16】Extramedullary blast crisis of CML is defined by infiltration of leukemic blasts in areas other than bone marrow， which has been reported in only 4-16% of CML cases during the disease course . As shown in Table 1， CML cases presenting with a bilineal extramedullary disease with bone marrow in chronic phase are rare， with only 4 reported cases. All of these cases had involvement of the lymph nodes with immunophenotyp-ic analysis of the blasts showing T lymphoid/myeloid bilineal phenotype. Surprisingly， no cases with B lymphoid/myeloid phenotype have been reported.\n\n【17】Among the cases of extramedullary blast crisis at initial diag-nosis showing bilineal phenotype ， there has been only1 case with 1 type of blasts located adjacent to， but distinct from， the other type of blasts with different lineage pheno-type . Chen et al. reported a 14-year-old male who present-ed with CML in blast phase with segregated extramedullarymyeloid sarcoma and T lymphoblastic lymphoma. The patho-logical examination of the lymphadenectomy sample showed T lymphoblasts in the lymph nodes and myeloblasts in the adja-cent soft tissue . The involved lymph nodes in our case car-ried a typical immunophenotype consistent with bilineal extra-medullary disease， showing co-existence of 2 distinct lineages of blasts， but not co-expressing normally exclusive markers on a single type of blast. Both blast populations were positive for BCR/ABL1 translocation， which confirmed extramedullary dis-ease representing a localized blastic transformation of CML. The above observations indicate that T lymphoid and myeloid blasts share common Ph+ progenitors， which may be involved in the development of blastic transformation in CML.\n\n【18】CML in blast crisis often exhibits CNS involvement . Despite achieving an initial major molecular response (3-log decrease in BCR/ABL1 transcript from baseline) to TKl in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy， our case was found to have blasts of myeloid lineage in the CNS 5 months after the diag-nosis， consistent with CNS relapse. As imatinib does not pen-etrate the blood-brain barrier， isolated CNS blast crises havebeen reported in about 20% of patients with CML in blast cri-sis treated with imatinib . Although the second-generation TKIs (nilotinib and dasatinib) have an improved penetration of the blood-brain-barrier， single cases of isolated CNS blast crises have also been reported . Therefore， the CNS has to be regarded as a sanctuary site of relapse for CML.\n\n【19】Conclusions\n\n【20】The possibility of extramedullary blast crisis as an initial pre-sentation in patients with CML should be considered. This may be more important in patients who initially present with lymphadenopathy， particularly those without significant ab-normalities in bone marrow morphology. Cytogenetic and mo-lecular diagnoses are particularly important in this situation. Further， an isolated CNS blast crisis should be considered if neurological symptoms evolve in patients who have shown a good response to therapy. The isolated CNS relapse of leu-kemia can be controlled by high-dose systemic and intrathe-cal chemotherapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It is an ocular condition， usually affecting both eyes. It affects infants， children and women in the reproductive age group. In developing countries， vitamin A deficiency in the diet and associated keratomalacia are major causes of childhood blindness. Purpose： To report the clinical finding of a patient with bilateral keratomalacia arising from severe vitamin A deficiency from a malnourished diet. Patients and methods： Case Report. Results： A two-year-old female with severe malnutrition presented with 3 weeks of watering and tonic blepharospasm affecting the right and left eyes. She exhibited hypertrichosis， severe weight loss， abnormal hairs with complete corneal melt in the right and left eyes and inflamed iris tissue in the right eye. She was treated with a high dose of vitamin A， but the right eye required evisceration and tarsorrhaphy was done in the left eye. Conclusion： The visual morbidity associated with xerophthalmia secondary to vitamin A deficiency can be devastating. Diet-induced vitamin A deficiency is prevalent in developing and war-torn countries. A good history taking and review of systems are valuable in evaluating malnourished patients with corneal melt.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Keratomalacia， Xerophthalmia， Vitamin A deficiency\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Vitamin A deficiency is the leading cause of preventable child-hood blindness. It increases the risk of death from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea. Vitamin A deficiency is estimated to affect more than 250 million children worldwide， with nearly 3 million suffering xerophthalmias yearly. Between a quarter and half， a million go blind. A fat-soluble vitamin，90% of vitamin A is stored in the liver.  Human deficient in vi-tamin A grow poorly， suffers more persistent or severe infections， and subsequently develops characteristic ocular manifestations termed“xerophthalmia\" Vitamin-A is required to maintain specialized epithelia (such as cornea and conjunctiva). Vitamin-A deficiency can be caused by different etiologies and may lead to severe complications， including keratomalacia or melting ofthe corneal stroma， which may result in corneal scarring or per-foration when the deficiency is not treated urgently.  We report a rare case of bilateral corneal melt arising from severe vitamin-A deficiency secondary to malnutrition and a lack of appropriate diet.\n\n【4】Case Report\n\n【5】A two-year-old female child was brought to University Eye Hos-pital (UEH， Kabul， Afghanistan). According to the patient's parent's history， in the last three weeks， the patient has had pro-gressive pain， tearing and tonic blepharospasm that she cannot open her eyes. The child weighed 10 kg and measured 60 cmin height. The patient recourses to iedgbithaer to the provincial hospital. Due to an ophthalmologist's absence， she was referred to University Eye Hospital in Kabul.\n\n【6】The patient parents were living in a remote district under insurgents' control， where no medical facilities were present and even no vaccination campaigns were allowed； it is worth-while that during vaccination campaigns in Afghanistan， sup-plemental vitamin A is also given to children under the age of 5 years. Furthermore， the parents'socio-economic situationwas not good， as the child’s father was disabled with no stable payment； meanwhile， family planning was not observed. At presentation， the patient was cachectic and irritable， the hairs were thin and pale， and hypertrichosis was found. \n\n【7】As Slit-lamp examination was impossible， she was admitted for Exam Under Anesthesia (EUA) the next day. Anaesthesia(EUA) examination revealed diffusely chemotic and keratinized conjunctiva in both eyes (OU) with xerosis but no bitot spots. Both corneas demonstrated total melt from limbus to limbus， with a collapsed anterior chamber. The right eye had a purulent iris affixed to the lens by extensive posterior synechiae. \n\n【8】A diagnosis of X3-B keratomalacia with severe protein-energy malnutrition was made. Treatment was initiated in the form of200.000 units of vitamin-A acetate administered by mouth in divided doses for 2 days and repeated 2 weeks later.\n\n【9】Because of poor visual potential and the risk of sympathetic ophthalmia， the patient's right eye was eviscerated. The patient’s left eye was treated with temporary tarsorrhaphy. The patient was referred to a specialized eye institution for a possible corneal graft. \n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Keratomalacia resulting from vitamin A deficiency is an impor-tant cause of preventable corneal blindness and opacificationand a major cause of pediatric ocular morbidity and severe vi-sual impairment in developing countries.\n\n【12】Vitamin-A deficiency causes a spectrum of ocular diseases known as xerophthalmia， which includes changes in anterior and posterior segments. Conjunctival xerosis with keratinizing squamous metaplasia， loss of goblet cells， and heaped accumula-tion of keratin (Bitot Spots) are characteristic and corneal pathol-ogy can range from mild epitheliopathy to severe keratomalacia resulting in blindness.\n\n【13】In developing countries， family education about a healthy diet and the importance of participation in vaccination cam-paigns in which supplemental vitamin-A is also administered to children under 5 years of age will reduce the risk of vitamin A deficiency and consequent ocular morbidities.\n\n【14】Our case illustrates the importance of obtaining a thorough nutritional history and review of systems in a patient with corneal melt. A high index of suspicion for vitamin A defi-ciency with prompt vitamin A supplementation initiation will prevent severe visual impairment.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】The visual morbidity associated with xerophthalmia secondary to vitamin A deficiency can be devastating. Diet-induced vita-min A deficiency is prevalent in developing and war-torn coun-tries. Therefore， a good history taking and review of systems are valuable in evaluating malnourished patients with corneal melt.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Weakness of the diaphragm with loss of vital capacity is almost universal in IBM. This is almost always asymptomatic. When respiratory complications occur， they are most often due to aspiration. Respiratory failure due to diaphragmatic weakness is exception-ally rare， particularly as the presenting symptom of the disease. It is not currently considered to be a parane-oplastic syndrome.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】Our patient presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure. This is the first such reported case without signs of weakness elsewhere of which we are aware. We suspected IBM based on her history of progressive weakness and findings on electromyography. There was a delay of 5 years in obtaining biopsy for confirmation， during which she presented with recurrent episodes of respiratory failure despite using non-invasive ventilation. An autopsy revealed the presence of papillary thyroid carcinoma with spread to local lymph nodes. On the basis that these co-morbidities are unlikely to have occurred by chance (we estimate 1x101)， we hypothesize that IBM may be a paraneoplastic condition. We acknowledge that proof would require demonstrating a pathogen-ic antibodv\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】IBM should be considered in older patients (age>45) presenting with otherwise unexplained respiratory fail-ure. A workup for possible malignancy in this setting appears reasonable.\n\n【6】MeSH Keywords： Diaphragm · Inclusion Bodies · Myositis· Paraneoplastic Syndromes\n\n【7】Sporadic inclusion body myositis (IBM) is the most frequent acquired myopathy in adults aged over 50 years. Estimates of prevalence (per million population) are 1.0 in Turkey； 4.7in the Netherlands； 10.7 in Connecticut， USA； 14.9 in western Australia； and 71 in Olmsted County， USA， and are approxi-mately 3-fold higher in those over age 50 . Weakness of the diaphragm is now better recognized as being almost univer-sal in IBM. Progressive loss of vital capacity (VC) is character-istic . Despite this， respiratory failure has only previously been described once as the presenting feature of IBM  (the article was published in Spanish and we present a translation in English as Supplementary Material. Furthermore， an asso-ciation with papillary thyroid carcinoma is novel and we pro-pose a paraneoplastic mechanism for this.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】Presentation\n\n【10】Our patient was an African-American woman， born in Haiti， previously well， who first presented to our Institution age 48. There was no significant family history. She was found con-fused at home by her family； this was due to acute-on-chron-ic hypercarbic respiratory failure， which resolved with the use of bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP).\n\n【11】She felt she had been getting weaker over the preceding 3-4years. She noticed this when walking long distances and when climbing stairs. Power was 5/5， including neck flexors. No deep tendon reflexes were elicited， although she was obese. Blood tests were unremarkable apart from creatinine kinase (CK) of 200 (<170 IU/lt). Acetylcholinesterase receptor antibodies(AChR Abs) were negative. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) showed a restrictive pattern with a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 30% of expected.\n\n【12】Nerve conduction studies (NCS) were normal apart from 1 absent F-wave in a peroneal nerve. Electromyography (EMG) showed widespread myopathic units with fibrillations at rest. A myositis， particularly IBM， was suspected at this stage due to her history and EMG findings. She was discharged on nocturnal BiPAP. A muscle biopsy was planned； however， we were unable to con-tact the patient to arrange follow-up in clinic after discharge.\n\n【13】Recurrent respiratory failure\n\n【14】She was admitted again 3 months later with another episode of hypercarbic respiratory failure， which again responded to BiPAP. A muscle biopsy was rescheduled， but she did not attend. The following year she presented elsewhere with respiratoryfailure requiring intubation and admission to intensive care. She spent 18 months in rehabilitation before returning home. She said she was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis (MG) at that time and had been on pyridostigmine 60 mg q6h and prednisone 5 mg daily since. She needed to use a walker or wheelchair for mobility thereafter， and she required home ox-ygen during the day with nocturnal BiPAP.\n\n【15】She presented at our Institution again， aged 53， with 3 days of progressive shortness of breath， requiring use of BiPAP during the day. One week prior， she had run out of her home medi-cines. Power was now 4/5 in the neck flexors and 3/5 in the deltoids； her other muscles remained 5/5. No fatigability was present and there was no ptosis. Reflexes were again absent.\n\n【16】She was treated for suspected community-acquired pneu-monia and for possible exacerbation of MG (methylpred-nisone 1000 mg iv and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg)400 mg/kg/day， both planned for 5 days). AChR R Abs were negative， as were anti-MUSK antibodies. Computerized to-mography (CT) of the chest showed only bibasilar atelectasis.\n\n【17】On day 4 of admission， NCS were performed. There was no sign of fatigability or of an electrodecremental response to repeated stimulation， so her IIg was stopped. EMG showed moderately increased spontaneous activity of the left C5-6paraspinal muscles， with fibrillation. However， the paraspi-nal muscles at C6-7 were normal on the same side. The left deltoid showed increased amplitude. All other muscles test-ed were normal. This was initially interpreted as showing ev-idence of a C5-6 radiculopathy.\n\n【18】She was unable to complete PFTs. On day 10， a steroid taper was started， decreasing from prednisone 60 mg by 5 mg every3 days. Pyridostigmine was stopped without signs of deteri-oration. By day 13， she was stable during the day with inter-mittent use of BiPAP (3 hours on， 3 hours off). Magnetic reso-nance imaging (MRI) was not possible due to her use of BiPAP.\n\n【19】Final admission\n\n【20】She was discharged to rehabilitation and readmitted 3 days later with recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure and acidosis. She was intubated in the Emergency Room. MRl of the brain on day9 of this admission showed a number of foci of restricted diffu-sion in the corpus callosum bilaterally， thought to be due to hy-poxic-ischemic injury at the time she was intubated.MRl of the neck showed degenerative changes but no signs of radiculop-athy or myelopathy. Initially， she was hypotensive and febrile. By day 13， she was sufficiently stable to be extubated to BiPAP.\n\n【21】On day 22 she had a tracheostomy placed due to persistent dependence on BiPAP. She remained ventilator-dependentthereafter. NCS on day 24 showed evidence of superimposed critical-illness neuropathy with significantly lower left medi-an and ulnar motor-evoked response amplitudes. EMG now showed myopathic units in both deltoids and the right bicep muscles (C5-6). The previously documented giant motor units in the left deltoid are were no longer observed.\n\n【22】On day 30， a biopsy of the quadriceps was performed， which confirmed our suspicion of IBM. This is shown in Figures l and 2. Variation in myofiber size was noted with atrophic fibers (up to50% of the specimen) and hypertrophic fibers. Rimmed vacu-oles were seen best on Congo red staining. Sparse chronic in-flammation was seen， with CD3-positive T cells.\n\n【23】Two days later， she became unresponsive and hypotensive， requiring a vasopressor infusion. Throughout the rest of her stay she remained intermittently hypotensive and delirious， responding only to painful stimuli. At 60 days into her ad-mission she developed pulseless electrical activity and died shortly thereafter. An autopsy was performed， which showed severe atrophy and fibrosis of the diaphragm. This was best seen with trichrome staining， showing fibrosis composing up to 80% of the diaphragm， with severely atrophic myofibers coursing through， and separated by， the fibrosis. Incidentally， papillary thyroid carcinoma with metastasis to 2 peri-glandu-lar lymph nodes was also identified.\n\n【24】Discussion\n\n【25】Diagnosis\n\n【26】IBM is a clinical diagnosis， which is confirmed by the findings on NCS， EMG， and biopsy， where possible. Our patient met the first 3 of 4 criteria for clinical diagnosis， given below (criteria from the 2011 European Neuromuscular Centre) ：\n\n【27】· age at onset >45 years；\n\n【28】· duration of weakness >12 months；\n\n【29】· CK <15x the upper limit of normal (ULN))；\n\n【30】·finger flexion weakness > shoulder abduction weakness.\n\n【31】In particular， she was lacking the classic pattern of weakness of finger flexors and/or knee extensors.\n\n【32】Our case appears unique in that she had no sign of weakness anywhere else on exam when she first presented. However， her history of progressive weakness and the initial EMG con-firmed a myopathic process. The degree of involvement of the diagram was strikingly out of proportion to the degree of in-volvement elsewhere. Although we were initially concerned about IBM specifically， the delay in performing biopsy to con-firm this resulted in significant additional uncertainty. This un-derscores the need for close follow-up of such patients pre-senting in crisis.\n\n【33】Similar cases\n\n【34】We were able to find only 5 prior pathologically-confirmed case reports of respiratory failure occurring with IBM . One of these occurred in the setting of HTLV， which we did not suspect (or test for) in our patient . The single other case we found presenting primarily with respiratory failure was in a woman aged 74， who， following an episode of pneumonia，developed recurrent hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring BiPAP. After a course of prednisone 1 mg/kg/day for 2 months， she showed no improvement and ultimately required a trache ostomy. It is unclear from the report whether the patient had weakness that was apparent elsewhere on presentation .\n\n【35】Pulmonary function in IBM\n\n【36】Asymptomatic impairment of respiratory function is common in patients with IBM， with forced vital capacity (FVC) <80% of pre-dicted in 44% (7/16) of patients in one series. Only one case of hypercarbia amongst this group was noted . PFTs (and poly-somnography) have therefore been recommended routinely in IBM. The importance of respiratory involvement as a late/ter-minal event in the course of IBM was highlighted in a series of 64 patients from 2011 . Recurrent aspiration pneumo-nia appears to be the principal problem. Primary respiratory failure was not identified as a late complication in the series.\n\n【37】Treatment\n\n【38】Earlier diagnosis may have changed our approach to treat-ment. Steroids and other immune suppressants are typically used empirically in patients with IBM. In our case， the fact that she presented again with respiratory failure on two occasions when her steroid dose was reduced or stopped suggests that she was deriving some benefit from these. While experience suggests that there are individuals who respond to such mea-sures， this is typically not sustained. Although one series of 8patients showed probable improvement on biopsy following use of prednisone for up to 12 months， this was not accompa-nied by an improvement in muscle strength . Results with other immune suppressants have been disappointing to date， although clinical trials with more novel agents are ongoing.\n\n【39】There may have been some empiric advantage in the use of agents been shown to improve contractility of the diaphragm. Neostigmine and aminophylline have been shown experimen-tally to counteract the impairment of contractility caused by hypercapnia. Thus， her use of pyridostigmine may have been of some benefit， albeit inadvertently as it was prescribed for MG .\n\n【40】BiPAP was beneficial for our patient. Whether this should be routinely employed in those with IBM and involvement of the diaphragm has not been investigated. Such a strategy appears rational and has been shown to improve quality of life in pa-tients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Diaphragmatic stim-ulation of dysfunctional muscle would be unlikely to produce additional gains in respiratory function.\n\n【41】A paraneoplastic disease?\n\n【42】Without an autopsy， the possibility of this being a paraneo-plastic disorder would not have been considered further. As PTC was not diagnosed ante-mortem， we were unable to an-alyze serum to look for a potentially causative antibody. IBM is not currently recognized to be a paraneoplastic phenom-enon， although cases associated with bladder and renal cell carcinoma have been identified . Our patient's IBM qualifies as a“possible paraneoplastic syndrome\" based on expert panel criteria from 2004：“A non-classical syndrome， no onconeural antibodies and cancer present within 2 years of diagnosis” .\n\n【43】Could the co-occurrence of IBM and PTC be simply a matter of chance? For an estimate， we begin with the age-adjusted incidence of thyroid cancer (TC)， which is 12.4/100 000/year in African-American women in the USA . We then reason with the following approximate assumptions：\n\n【44】· TC with metastases to local lymph nodes developed in our patient age 45-49；\n\n【45】·The age group 45-50 accounts for 7.2% of the standardized population (used in age adjustment) ； however\n\n【46】·Newly diagnosed TC may be more common in this age group， accounting for approximately 12% of cases (vs. other age groups) ；\n\n【47】·80% of cases of TC are PTC；\n\n【48】·12-80% of cases of PTC have nodal metastases at presen-tation .\n\n【49】Thus， her annual risk of developing PTC， in this age range， may be given as：\n\n【50】The age-and-sex-adjusted incidence of sporadic IBM in adults age 30 or older has been estimated at 0.41/100，000/year . We assume：\n\n【51】·Sex is approximately evenly matched in the standardized population， i.e. male： female≈1：1.\n\n【52】·20% of cases of IBM are diagnosed in those age <60； there-fore， the incidence in the age group 30-60 is ≈20% of that in those >60 .\n\n【53】·The age group 30-59 accounts for 41.7% of the standard-ized population.\n\n【54】We then calculated her annual risk of IBM， based on her age， as follows：\n\n【55】Thus， the risk of both conditions developing within a year， as is typical for paraneoplastic disorders， is of the order of 1×which we believe is sufficiently unlikely to make chance a re-mote possibility.\n\n【56】Alternatively， we may view the PTC as having been longstand-ing and asymptomatic. PTC， large enough to be detectable by ultrasound， has been estimated to occur in up to 5% of adults. The natural history of such asymptomatic lesions remains un-clear. Although surgery is usually performed， the utility of ex-tensive resection (beyond thyroid lobectomy) has been ques-tioned； the estimated survival rate at 20 years is thought be99% with current approaches .\n\n【57】A paraneoplastic etiology appears more plausible if we consid-er IBM as part of the spectrum ofT cell-mediated autoimmune processes directed at intracellular antigens， particularly derma-tomyositis (DMM) and polymyositis (PM). DMM， PM， and， to a lesser extent， IBM are associated with cancer at rates which exceed that expected due to surveillance bias (with a stan-dardized incidence-ratio for IBM of 2.4 (95% CI 1.2-4.9) . This is particularly true for DMM， and in some patients a para-neoplastic disease course for DMM has been described .\n\n【58】PTC is a rare cause of paraneoplastic syndromes. Spread to lymph nodes， as in our patient， is thought to be a prerequisite for such syndromes. Reported paraneoplastic conditions in pa-tients with PTC are limited to case reports and include DMM(5 patients in total)， PM， propriospinal myoclonus， cerebellar syndrome， acquired reactive perforating collagenosis (a hy-perkeratotic skin disorder)， and a condition resembling adult-onset Still's disease . As in our patient， no pathogno-monic antibodies were identified in these cases.\n\n【59】A possible association between IBM and PTC should be falsifiable， such as with the use of the standard 'One-Sample Proportion Test’ (with a significance， as is conventional， of 5%). As above， we assume that thyroid cancer， of sufficient size to be detectable\n\n【60】Supplementary Materials\n\n【61】Diaz PJ， Garcia SF， Sanchez LJ， Saborido FJ.\n\n【62】Inclusion body myositis with respiratory onset.\n\n【63】Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is a spontaneous， inflammato-ry， idiopathic myopathy which is occasionally hereditary. It af-fects more females than males (3： 1) and is the most com-mon myopathy in the elderly population i.e. over 50 years old.\n\n【64】Weakness and muscle atrophy are painless and can be gener-alized or limited just to the limbs. In 20% of cases weaknessby ultrasound， has a prevalence of around 5% in adults . With any sample size (i.e.， patients with IBM) and an observed prevalence of asymptomatic PTC of 5%， we can conclude there is no association with a power of 95%. We can accept such an association with a power of≈95% with， for example， a sample size of 60 and an observed prevalence of 15% or a sample size of 20 and a prevalence of 22.5%. Such sample sizes have already been achieved in case series of patients with IBM at-tending specialized centers. Thus， to settle the question， an em-piric policy of screening for PTC at the time of diagnosis of IBM could be instituted at a tertiary center for a period of 5-10 years.\n\n【65】Conclusions\n\n【66】This case highlights the importance of early recognition of re-spiratory failure as a possible presenting feature of IBM. As this is a potentially life-threatening manifestation， we suggest that IBM should be considered as a possibility in any patient aged over 45 with new-onset of otherwise unexplained respi-ratory failure. A workup for malignancy appears reasonable on an individual basis. To this end， a CT with contrast， followed by PET/CT， appears reasonable， as is suggested in the workup of suspected paraneoplastic disorders. A thyroid-focused ul-trasound may be a reasonable alternative.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Laboratory tests showed serum creatinine 430.5 umol/L， urea 44.0 mmol/L， potassium 5.7 mmol/L， C-reactive protein 208 mg/L， procalcitonin 8 ng/mL， platelets 14x10°/L， hemoglobin 5.83 mmol/L， and albumin 30 g/L. Due to hemodynamic instability with profound hypotension and the potentially high bleeding risk when doing central venous catheter insertion or using anticoagulants， PD was selected as the AKl treatment. The PD catheter was implanted by the surgical method after the transfusion of platelet concentrate. Automated PD in tidal mode was implemented using 1.5% and 2.3% glucose： basic in-flow volume 1200 mL and a tidal volume of 700 mL. Effective dialysis with ultrafiltration up to 1200 mL/day was achieved. The patient was discharged home in good condition. After 1 month， PD was discontinued due to the renal function returning to its pre-septic state of CKD category G3b.

The great challenge for nephrol-ogists is the need for RRT in AKI patients with liver cirrhosis. Cirrhotic patients needing emergency care for AKI have rel-ative contraindications for extracorporeal RRT and PD .\n\n【6】We describe the case of a patient with 2 severe chronic dis-eases， liver cirrhosis and chronic kidney disease (CKD)， who had a sudden deterioration of renal function due to septice-mia of renal origin. Other health problems were thrombocy-topenia causing a high risk of hemorrhagic diathesis and he-modynamic instability due to septic shock. Additionally， a less popular RRT method， PD， was used for the AKl treatment. We consider our patient as attractive from the clinical point of view because of the coincidence of multiple co-occurring dis-eases (AKI， CKD， thrombocytopenia， urosepsis， liver cirrhosis， type 2 diabetes， hypertension， and hypothyroidism)， of which acute deteriorations (AKl， aggravated thrombocytopenia，and urosepsis) were successfully treated. Our case report may also have an educational value by showing that PD can be a valu-able method for AKI treatment in selected patients with sub-stantial comorbidities.\n\n【7】A 60-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital after experiencing syncope at work.

Her medical history included liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A score， no previous decompensation events due to liver cirrhosis)， thrombocytopenia， type 2 diabetes， hypertension， hypothyroid-ism， and CKD category G3b of unknown origin. Before admis-sion， urine analyses did not reveal proteinuria or erythrocytu-ria. Hepatorenal syndrome type 2 and the abuse of painkillers， mainly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs， were suspect-ed as contributors to CKD. In October 2015， she had gastroin-testinal bleeding due to a vascular malformation detected by gastroscopy in the stomach drain region. Esophageal varices were not found. At that time， the hemoglobin level decreased to 4.59 mmol/L， and blood was transfused. Serum creatinine increased to 220.1 umol/L .\n\n【8】The patient was not a tobacco smoker and did not take psy-choactive substances. Her alcohol consumption was below30 g/week.\n\n【9】At the time of admission， we excluded acute ischemic cardi-ac disease and assessed the status of her already-known dis-eases. For elimination of infection， septicemia， and shock due to sepsis， C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels were mea-sured in serum， and urine and blood samples were cultured. We did not suspect thromboembolic diseases or disseminat-ed intravascular coagulopathy (DIC)； therefore， fibrinogen and D-dimer levels were not assessed.\n\n【10】Table 1.

The Child-Pugh classification  indicated class B and the traditional Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD)  showed a score of 24. As this score was >12， we adjusted it by incorporating the se-rum sodium concentration and also obtained a score of 24.\n\n【15】An abdominal ultrasound scan showed enlarged nodular het-erogeneous liver (sonographic features of cirrhosis)， a trace free fluid around the liver， enlarged spleen (the bipolar dimen-sion of 170 mm)， correct position and size of both kidneys， increased echogenicity of the renal cortex， cortical cysts up to53 mm bilaterally， and collective systems without hydronephro-sis and calculi above 4 mm. Grade 1 ascites (mild ascites only detectable by ultrasound) was diagnosed .\n\n【16】Based on the results mentioned above， we diagnosed AKI stage 3 ， liver cirrhosis with mild ascites， which progressed from class A to B by the Child-Pugh classification， and very severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count ≤20x10°/L). We also suspected sepsis of urinary tract origin (procalcitonin over 2 ng/mL， pyuria). Positive blood and urine cultures for Escherichia coli enabled the final diagnosis of urosepsis co-existing with septic shock and AKI.\n\n【17】Complex treatment was initiated . The most ur-gent medical problem was deciding what kind of RRT to ap-ply. The patient was qualified for PD due to a risk of bleeding during surgery for obtaining vascular access for extracorpore-al dialysis， and unstable blood pressure.\n\n【18】A straight， double-cuffed PD catheter (Tenckhoff type) was surgically implanted under local anesthesia. During the cath-eter insertion， about 1000 mL of amber-colored peritoneal flu-id was evacuated. Platelets were transfused before and during the procedure. Bleeding to the peritoneal cavity was not de-tected， but an abdominal wall hematoma occurred . Automated PD (APD) using a tidal system was performed. We used parameters of the daily APD tida! procedure： treat-ment time about 10 h； retention time： 60 min； primary inflow：1250 ml； tidal inflow： 700 ml； total volume： 6160 ml. Fluids with glucose concentration 1x1.5%5000 ml and 1x2.3%5000ml were used. Ultrafiltration obtained from the procedure was800-1200 ml/day. The abdominal wall hematoma was cOM-pletely absorbed during hospitalization.\n\n【19】We applied intravenous therapy with antibiotics (levoflox-acin， linezolid)， catecholamines， 20% albumins， irradiated platelet concentrate (40 units transfused during hospitaliza-tion)， and irradiated red blood cell concentrate (2 units in to-tal). Medicines associated with comorbidities were adminis-tered orally： levothyroxine sodium (75 pg once daily， linagliptin(5 mg once daily)， esomeprazole (40 mg once daily)， potassium chloride (two 600 mg tablets three times daily)， and carvedilol(6.25 mg twice a day).\n\n【20】As a result of the complex multistep treatment used， there were significant improvements in the patient's condition and labora-tory test results. Despite the substantial deterioration of medi-cal status due to sepsis and AKl， liver function remained stable. The patient was discharged from the hospital with a serum cre-atinine concentration of 189.2 umol/L. APD was continued on an ambulatory basis for 20 days. The PD catheter was removed 50days after the start of PD， without any complications， at a serum creatinine level of 122.0 umol/L and platelet count of 32×10/L\n\n【21】Discussion\n\n【22】Acute kidney injury in subjects with multiorgan failure should be treated with a method individually tailored to the patient. The use of PD in an emergency is not common， possibly due to the lack of availability in a given facility or the staff's in-ability to use this RRT .\n\n【23】Patients with liver cirrhosis， especially those with ascites， requiring urgent RRT， are a unique challenge. This population has relative contraindications for both extracorporeal RRT and PD . Therefore， for AKl treatment in our patient， we initially discussed extracorporeal dialysis techniques and PD.\n\n【24】Extracorporeal methods include conventional intermittent he modialysis (HD) and continuous RRT (CRRT)， as well as slow low-efficiency dialysis (SLED) and slow low-efficiency dai-ly dialysis (SLEDD). The advantage of extracorporeal dialysis techniques over PD is the more efficient and quicker elimina-tion of uremic toxins， potassium， serum ammonia，and water. Therefore， life-threatening hyperkaliemia， severe hypercatab-olism， or pulmonary edema require highly efficient extracorpo-real techniques. However， the related risk of hypotension and bleeding limit their use in cirrhotic subjects .\n\n【25】Hemodynamic disorders occurring during traditional HD may be poorly tolerated in patients with hepatorenal syndrome due to concomitant systemic vasodilatation， increased cardi-ac output， and hypotension . SLED or SLEDD appear to be acceptable RRT methods for use in hemodynamically unsta-ble AKI subjects ， and they could be performed with-out anticoagulation in 86% of dialysis sessions . Patients with liver cirrhosis often develop acquired coagulopathy due to decreased hepatic clotting factor synthesis， increased fibri-nolysis， and quantitative platelet deficiency associated with hypersplenism. These abnormalities increase the risk of bleed-ing during large-vessel cannulation to the access for extracor-poreal RRT. The overall frequency of hemorrhage/hematoma due to image-guided central venous catheter insertion ranges from below 2% to 4%， and it is the most common ear-ly complication of this procedure. Blind catheter insertion ac-counts for 10% of hematomas . Lethal hemorrhagic com-plications of central venous catheter placement were also described . The data do not show that patients subjected to these procedures were at risk of bleeding due to thrombo-cytopenia or coagulopathy.\n\n【26】There are 2 main types of PD： continuous ambulatory PD(CAPD) and APD， which is cycler-assisted. APD is more effec-tive in waste product removal， which optimizes dialysis ade-quacy. One of the APD modalities is tidal APD， which is the preferred treatment modality in subjects with ascites， as it al-lows a controlled outflow of fluid from the peritoneal cavity. Tidal PD also reduces drainage pain because the peritone-al cavity always contains part of the fill volume . Ascites drainage and management improve patients' well-being and quality of life .\n\n【27】Among the shortcomings of using PD in patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites is the possibility of an increased risk of peritonitis and worsening of malnutrition due to protein losswith dialysate. On the other hand， there are reports that an in-crease in hydrostatic pressure in the abdomen during PD ther-apy can slow the appearance of protein-rich ascites， leading to better nutrition . In septic AKI patients without liver cirrho-sis， and showing mild or moderate catabolism， the higher in-tensity of PD did not lower the mortality rate or improve kid-ney function recovery or metabolic control . Therefore， a favorable effect of PD treatment might be obtained with low-er dialysate volumes per session (32-38 Lvs. 40-48 L) .\n\n【28】Abdominal wall hematomas are seldom reported as compli-cations of PD catheter insertion if a surgical method without trocar is used for implantation of classic catheters. In the pre-vious studies on use of PD for AKl in patients with chronic liv-er diseases， no abdominal hematomas were shown ， although bleedings to the peritoneal cavity with the use of tro-car technique for catheter placement were demonstrated . When routine methods were not applied， like the insertion of embedded PD catheters， abdominal wall hematomas were reported in from 0%  to 46% of cases. Surgical revi-sion was needed in 33% of subjects with subcutaneous he-matomas due to implantation of embedded PD catheters . However，embedded catheters are not used for AKI treatment. A simplified one-port laparoscopic technique of PD catheter placement was not found to be complicated with postoper-ative abdominal wall bleeding . A comparison of perma-nent PD catheters (surgically-implanted Tenckhoff， medically-implanted Tenckhoff， and the 2 types of the Toronto Western Hospital catheters) did not reveal any differences concerning abdominal hematomas .\n\n【29】PD is already used for AKl in patients with chronic liver diseas-es  . Evidence of recent bleeding ， hemody-namic instability ， and ascites removal  were among the reasons for use of PD for AKI treatment. Studies evaluat-ing use of PD in a population presenting various etiologies of end-stage renal disease and liver disease concluded that PD has the advantages of direct removal of ascitic fluid， avoid-ance of anticoagulation， and slow and continuous ultrafiltra-tion during equilibration PD techniques， which causes less he-modynamic instability .\n\n【30】In our patient， we used PD for AKI treatment. Compared with extracorporeal RRT methods， the advantages of using PD in our patient included effective restoration and maintenance of hemodynamic stability， less risk of life-threatening bleeding during the performance of dialysis access， and removal of as-citic fluid， if needed， without additional abdominal punctures. CRRT， SLED， or SLEDD were excluded for use in our patient due to the need for good vascular access ， the performance of which we gauged as a potential burden with thrombocytope-nia-related bleeding. The main PD disadvantage in our patient would be a risk of peritonitis. Protein malnutrition was alsoconsidered. We expected that the patient’s state would im-prove due to the complex treatment， quickly obtaining hemo-dynamic stability and amelioration of thrombocytopenia sever-ity. If AKI was reversible in our patient， PD treatment could be discontinued. If the patient needed permanent RRT， PD could be continued without any additional surgery for dialysis access. The initiation of RRT with PD did not preclude its conversion to other dialys is modalities if such a treatment was determined to be better given the new health conditions of our patient.\n\n【31】Table 2.

Although we did not consider liver cirrhosis as a cause of AKI， hepatic-related abnormalities could worsen in a septic state that concomitantly occurred . The patient's prothrombin index being <80%-270%(78%) indicated severe liver fibro-sis but still not cirrhosis . The role played by coagulation defects in the occurrence of bleeding in liver cirrhosis is un-clear . Severe thrombocytopenia， like that in our patient， occurs in 1% of cirrhotic subjects . A platelet count be-low 15x10°/L can cause risk of bleeding with minimal trau-ma . In non-cirrhotic patients with AKl， thrombocytopenia was also an indication for PD. In an 89-year-old woman with acute pyelonephritis， septic shock， atrial fibrillation， and wors-ening renal failure， HD had to be changed to PD due to type Il heparin-induced thrombocytopenia . PD was intensified to avoid installing an HD catheter in a patient with severethrombocytopenia after methotrexate administration . In gram-negative sepsis and AKI， DIC can contribute to a de-crease in platelet count . However， we did not find any evidence of this mechanism in our patient. We did not sus-pect DIC at admission or later， when the patient's status was quickly improving.\n\n【35】In our patient， a substantial abdominal wall hematoma oc-curred due to the classical PD catheter insertion using the sur-gical method， but it must be remembered that she had severe thrombocytopenia. This suggested that bleeding during vein cannulation for extracorporeal RRT and anticoagulation during RRT would be risky. Eventual bleeding during surgical insertion of the PD catheter is usually less dangerous and easier to over-come than potential bleeding during large-vessel cannulation.\n\n【36】Our case shows that tidal PD can be an effective RRT method in cirrhotic AKI patients with hemodynamic instability during sepsis and thrombocytopenia. In the described case， a signifi-cant improvement in the patient's condition was obtained af-ter the complex treatment， including the use of PD. Return of renal function to the status before AKI was achieved； there-fore，RRT could be withdrawn. The treatment turned out to be efficient and free from significant complications. However， it needs to be mentioned that liver cirrhosis in our patient was associated with mild ascites (never previously evacuated)， no hyponatremia， a thrombotic index showing rather severefibrosis than cirrhosis ， and a MELD score of 24 (this score ranges from 6 to 40).\n\n【37】Although urosepsis and AKI resolved and the platelet count increased， liver cirrhosis and CKD were still significant health problems in our patient. As stated in the Case Report section， hepatorenal syndrome type 2 was suspected in our patient be fore admission， among other contributing factors. One of the main criteria for the diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome type 2is serum creatinine level over 133 umol/L in the absence of signs of parenchymal renal disease (proteinuria of over 500 mg/d or hematuria of over 0.50 red blood cells/high-power field) in a cirrhotic patient with ascites . Before AKl and after re-covery from AKl， our patient did not present with serum cre-atinine over 133 umol/L when she was in stable clinical con-dition. However， the risk of hepatorenal syndrome existed in this patient： the probability of hepatorenal syndrome occur-rence was evaluated for 18% at 1 year and 39% at 5 years in nonazotemic patients with cirrhosis and ascites . At pres-ent， hepatorenal syndrome can be improved by vasoconstric-tors， such as terlipressin， in combination with albumin . Terlipressin therapy reversed hepatorenal syndrome types 1and 2 in 48% and 46% of patients， respectively . Our pa-tient could be a candidate for such a treatment in the future.\n\n【38】Conclusions\n\n【39】PD appears to be an effective method of AKI treatment in selected liver cirrhotic patients with sepsis of renal origin. Thrombocytopenia， with a high risk of hemorrhagic diathesis， and hemodynamic instability， suggest choosing PD as a meth-od of RRT in such patients. Further research and reports of ex-perience from other medical centers might help to select PD in similar cases. Despite this， in our opinion， PD is underused in emergency patients with multiple comorbidities.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

It usually occurs in sun-exposed areas； perianal location is rare. The extension to the anal canal is exceptional， only a few cases were reported in the literature. Observation： We report the case of a 58-years-old patient， referred for chronic ulceration of the perianal area. Histopathology revealed an extensive basal cell carcinoma. Wide local excision was performed， with a favourable outcome. Conclusion： the main lesson from this case is that although basal cell carcinoma is exceptional in the perianal region， a biopsy is mandatory for all chronic perianal ulcerations.\n\n【1】KEYWORDS Anal canal， basal cell carcinoma， perianal ulceration\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Perianal basal cell carcinoma is a rare entity， as well as the ex-tension to the anal canal. The diagnosis and the therapeutic management of this condition could be challenging.\n\n【4】Case report：\n\n【5】We report the case of a 58 years old male， unmarried farm worker with low income. The patient had no previous medical history； his primary complaint was an anal lesion evolving for over nine years. The ulceration had a negative impact on both his social and sexual life. No other symptoms were reported by the pa-tient， except intermittent constipation. Different practitioners treated the lesion as anal abscesses， fistulas or fissures. A proctol-ogist referred the patient after performing a biopsy of the lesion. The clinical examination found a 10cmx8cm ulcerovegetative tumour of the anal margin. This lesion extended to the root of the scrotum .The rectal examination revealed the extension of a tumour into the entrance of the anal canal， the testing of the internal and external sphincter tonus found nocontinence problems. The rest of the physical examination was normal. Rectoscopy with staged biopsies was performed， the macroscopic appearance was normal， histology revealed a sim-ple inflammatory reaction without tumour cells in the anal canal. Given the size and the long evolution of the lesion， an extensive workup was carried out (a thoraco abdominopelvic CT scan)； no distant metastases or significant locoregional lymph nodes were found.\n\n【6】A defunctioning colostomy was initially performed，immedi-ately followed by a wide tumour excision. A margin of 1 cm was observed in the perineum， the resection continued in the anal canal up to the pectinate line， taking away the external sphinc-ter. The internal sphincter looked intact， and it was preserved. Additional biopsies were made higher in the anal canal. The pathology report of the surgical specimen confirms the diagnosis of an infiltrating and moderately differentiated ulceronodular basal cell carcinoma. The lateral margins were a tumour free； the tumor infiltrated the external sphincter， the internal sphincter was healthy. A week later， the perineal wound was covered by a thin skin graft. The wound healed three weeks later. Two months after the operation， the patient presented with incom-plete anal stenosis， which required three sessions of dilatation leading to the favourable outcome. The patient was regularly seen for check-ups， he resumed his previous activities right after the last anal dilatation. No recurrence was seen four vears after surgery .\n\n【7】DISCUSSION\n\n【8】BCC is the most common cutaneous carcinomas . They occur most often in elderly subjects， but it is more and more common among subjects in a second or third decade. Although BCC is often seen in exposed areas， the most frequent sites of incidence are not those of maximum solar exposure . It is assumed that in addition to the effects of UV， there is an involvement of the embryological closure zones . The perianal occurrence of basal cell carcinomas is less than 0.5% and excluding patients with genodermatoses (Gorlin syndrome type or xeroderma pig-mentosum)， this frequency is close to 0.27% in the last major published series. The perianal occurrence is rare， the exten-sion to the anal canal is Exceptional . Clinical examination often leads to the diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma characterised by a pearly， rounded， translucent and telangiectatic lesion that spreads progressively . However， in the perianal region， the diagnosis can be delayed from a few months to many years(embarrassed patients tend to delay first medical consultation). The tumor then is typically an ulcerous lesion， bordered by a peripheral rim； At this stage it is unlikely to be confused with an abscess or a fissure； A biopsy is often needed to eliminate more frequent and sometimes more serious tumors： squamous cell carcinomas and verrucous carcinomas that are responsible for almost three quarters of perianal tumors . ， Melanoma， Paget's disease and Bowen’s disease should also be differenti-ated. Cloacogenic carcinoma (basaloid carcinoma) should be eliminated. This carcinoma is locally aggressive； it can also metastasise， and therefore requires a more radical treatment. Sometimes， only the immunohistochemistry confirms the diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma.\n\n【9】Treatment is primarily based on surgery. The resection of a tumour with a safety margin of 10 mm is often sufficient . Radical surgery such as abdominoperineal resection， is rarely needed. Some authors propose neoadjuvant external radiother-apy for locally advanced tumours . For others， it is an al-ternative to surgery in case of surgical contraindications， or if the patient refuses a mutilating intervention. Chemotherapy does not yet have a place in the therapeutic arsenal of basal cell carcinoma. Nevertheless， Imiquimod in topical treatment seems to give promising results for superficial BCC . Fluorouracil cream is being evaluated for the same purpose.\n\n【10】Basal cell carcinoma is generally of good prognosis. It is lo-cally invasive and rarely metastasises： a single case with lymph node metastasis has been reported in the literature . Recur-rence after local excision is very rare： none in the series of Pater-son and Al and only one case in Gibson's ；. Even though the diagnosis is often late， and the treatment is more aggres-sive is the perianal location， the prognosis is still reasonable compared to other histological entities.\n\n【11】CONCLUSION\n\n【12】The perianal location of BCC is exceptional. In advanced stages， only the histology establishes the diagnosis with certainty. Ex-tension to the anal canal is the result of late diagnosis and man-agement.\n\n【13】The takeaway lesson of this case is to highlight the necessity to educate practitioners on the value of performing biopsies over chronic or recurrent lesions of the perianal region.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

This report presents a 60-year-old man from Hong Kong with gingivitis and poorly controlled diabetes who visited his chiropractor with low back pain 2 weeks following mild COVID-19 and was diagnosed with paraspinal， psoas， and epidural abscess due to S. oralis.\n\n【2】Case Report： The patient tested positive for COVID-19 when asymptomatic， then had a mild 10-day course of the illness，followed by low back pain 1 week later， prompting him to visit his primary care provider， who diagnosed sciat-ica and treated him with opioid analgesics. He presented to a chiropractor the following week， noting severe low back pain with radiation into the gluteal regions and posterior thighs， difficulty with ambulation， and mild neck pain. Considering the patient's diabetes， widespread symptoms， and weakness， the chiropractor ordered whole-spine magnetic resonance imaging， which suggested possible multifocal spinal abscess and referred him urgently to a spine surgeon. The surgeon conducted testing consistent with bacterial infection， and referred to an infectious disease specialist， who confirmed S. oratis spinal infection via lumbar paraspinal needle biopsy and culture. The patient was first treated with oral antibiotics， then intravenous antibiotics in a hospital. Over4 weeks， his spinal pain improved， and laboratory markers of infection normalized.\n\n【3】Conclusions： This case illustrates an opportunistic pyogenic spinal infection including paraspinal， psoas， and epidural ab-scesses caused by S. oratis in an immunocompromised patient following COVID-19 illness.\n\n【4】Keywords： Back Pain·Chiropractic·COVID-19·Epidural Abscess · Psoas Abscess\n\n【5】Spinal infections can affect the intervertebral disc， body， spi-nal canal， or adjacent paraspinal tissue . When caused by bacteria other than tuberculosis， they are termed pyogen ic spinal infections . Patients with pyogenic spinal infection typically present with neck and/or back pain . However， such patients may be a challenge to diagnose as only about half will present with a fever， and only a minority have neu-rologic deficits . Pyogenic spinal infection is important to detect early as it has a mortality rate of 2-20% even in devel-oped countries .\n\n【6】Pyogenic spinal infections affect between 1： 100 000 and1： 250 000 individuals per year . Well-described risk factors for pyogenic spinal infection include immunocompromise， di-abetes mellitus， substance abuse， chronic infection such as HIV， malnutrition， long-term systemic steroid use， and spine surgery . Pyogenic spinal infections are most common in the lumbar region ， and are multifocal in 35% of cases， af-fecting more than 1 spinal region .\n\n【7】Streptococcus oralis is a gram-positive bacterium that is a member of the Streptococcus mitis family， also called the Streptococcus viridans group， and is part of the oral micro bi-ota . S. oralis can spread via the bloodstream to the brain， spinal cord， and spine， which may be triggered by spinal in-strumentation or anesthesia  or dental infection . This bacterium can cause opportunistic infections in immunocom-promised individuals .\n\n【8】According to a Search of PubMed and Google Scholar on August17，2022， and citation tracking of identified articles， 15 cases of pyogenic spinal infection occurring in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) had been published . Authors have suspected that patients with COVID-19 may be more susceptible to pyogenic spinal infections due to immune dys-regulation， immune suppression， or lymphocytopenia . However， in one series， the authors suggested spinal infection arose due to immune suppression induced by a medication used to treat COVID-19 (tocilizumab) . In general， opportunis-tic secondary infections are common in those with COVID-19， and a recent systematic review found that 16% of COVID-19patients develop a bacterial superinfection .\n\n【9】As chiropractors are portal of entry providers that often man-age spinal pain ， they may rarely encounter patients with spinal infection . However， given the potential rise in cases of pyogenic spinal infections related to COVID-19， an aging population， drug use， or spine procedures ， and con-sidering these patients may present with back or neck pain as an isolated finding ， it is possible patients with this con-dition could seek chiropractic care. Accordingly， we present acase of pyogenic spinal infection following COVID-19 illness that was initially misdiagnosed， and only identified after vis-iting a chiropractor.\n\n【10】This report presents a 60-year-old man from Hong Kong with gingivitis and poorly controlled diabetes who visited his chiro-practor with low back pain 2 weeks following a mild COVID-19illness and was diagnosed with paraspinal， psoas， and epidur-al abscesses due to S. oralis.\n\n【11】Case Report\n\n【12】Patient Information\n\n【13】A 60-year-old Asian male factory owner with a history of poor-ly controlled diabetes and gingivitis initially tested positive for Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) in March 2022 when as-ymptomatic as part of a screening program required for his work， considering he traveled regularly. Testing was conduct-ed at a Hong Kong Community Testing Centre maintained by the Department of Health and involved nasopharyngeal swab and polymerase chain reaction testing through an accredited laboratory .He had an uncomplicated course of COVID-19illness， with mild symptoms of cough and congestion， and de-veloped a fever for 3 days. He recovered while under quaran-tine at home over a span of 10 days， subsequently returning to work . He did not require a visit to the hospital， supplemental oxygen， or any antiviral or other specific medi-cal treatment for COVID-19. He was also initially tested for in-fluenza， which was negative. He had no history of COVID-19vaccination.\n\n【14】One week after recovery from COVID-19， the patient developed low back pain. As his pain symptoms began to radiate into the lower extremities， he visited his primary care provider. This pro-vider diagnosed the patient with bilateral sciatica and treat-ed him with an opioid analgesic (tramadol) without success.\n\n【15】The following week， the patient presented to a chiropractor in a multidisciplinary office reporting progressively worsen-ing low back pain and bilateral gluteal pain with associated numbness and paresthesia in the gluteal region and posterior thighs. He rated his pain an 8 out of 10 on the numeric pain scale. He reported excruciating pain when walking and had difficulty climbing stairs and walking for more than 5 min. He also noted mild localized neck pain. The patient denied any history of trauma， arthropathy， constitutional symptoms in-cluding fever， night sweats， chills， or weight loss， but did en-dorse chronic episodes of diarrhea.\n\n【16】The patient injected insulin subcutaneously (Mixtard 30) twice a day and took metformin per os 3 times a day， but had failedto adhere to the dietary recommendations for diabetes. He also had been diagnosed with gingivitis but had no recent dental procedures. He previously had a self-limiting episode of neck pain 10 years prior， and cervical and shoulder radiographs at that time identified mild osteophytes at the lower cervical re gion. He had no history of tuberculosis or contact with individ-uals with tuberculosis， and no history of spinal instrumentation or injection. He was a non-smoker and was a social drinker.\n\n【17】Clinical Findings\n\n【18】On examination by the chiropractor， the patient was apyrex-ial with an oral temperature of 36.8℃ and his cardiopulmo-nary and abdominal examinations revealed no abnormalities. There was hypertonicity and mild tenderness along the cervi-cal and lumbar paraspinal muscles. Motion palpation identi-fied restriction and tenderness at the C4/5，T1/2，and T3/4/5spinal levels and sacroiliac joints bilaterally. Muscle strength was graded 4/5 for hip flexion bilaterally with pain (Medical Research Council Scale)， while the sensory examination and muscle stretch reflexes were normal. The patient's active cer-vical spine range of motion was mildly limited without an in-crease in pain. However， his active lumbar range of motion was severely limited with pain in all tested planes of motion(ie，flexion， extension， and lateral flexion).\n\n【19】As the patient had low back pain with radiation， severe pain， weakness， reportedly poorly controlled diabetes， lack of re-sponse to previous treatment， and severely limited range of motion without specific trauma， the chiropractor considered spinal stenosis as a working diagnosis yet also wanted to as-sess for severe spinal pathology such as cancer or infection. Given the patient's concerns involved both cervical and lum-bar regions， the chiropractor ordered a whole-spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)， which was performed the same day of consultation at the facility's imaging center.\n\n【20】MRI of the whole spine revealed lesions in the cervical and lumbar posterior paraspinal regions， the psoas muscles bilat-erally， and lumbar epidural space . The radiologist suggested these findings were consistent with inflammatory changes， and could represent a multifocal abscess， malignan-cy， or myositis， and， less likely， paraspinal muscle and epidur-al hematomas. Although there were degenerative changes at the L3/4 intervertebral disc， there was no evidence of spon-dylodiscitis or vertebral osteomyelitis， as the endplates had reduced short tau inversion recovery (STIR) signal， consistent with fatty bone marrow.\n\n【21】The chiropractor then conferred with the orthopedic spine sur-geon within the multidisciplinary office and together they for-mulated a differential diagnosis. Spinal infection was consideredthe primary working diagnosis given the imaging findings of a paraspinal， psoas， and epidural inflammatory lesion， and the patient's background of diabetes， despite an absence of imag ing features of spondylodiscitis. Myositis related to COVID-19was also considered given the potential for this to include im-aging features of paraspinal inflammation .Metastasis and hematoma were less probable. While these may involve the epidural space and paraspinal muscles， the imaging findings were not as consistent with these diagnoses . The sur-geon recommended seeing the patient urgently， and the pa-tient saw the spine surgeon 3 days after obtaining the lumbar MRI. The surgeon ordered several laboratory tests to evaluate for potential infection.\n\n【22】Tests revealed elevated acute-phase reactants， including a C-reactive protein (CRP) at 85 mg/L (normal <5)， erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 95 mm/h， and procalcitonin of0.09 ng/mL (normal <0.07). The white blood cell count waselevated at 10.7×10/L (normal 3.7-9.4)， with 78.7% neutro phils (normal 41.5-73.8%)， suggestive of bacterial infection. The patient's red blood cell (RBC) and morphology testing showed a low RBC count of 4.18×1012/L (normal 4.3-5.8)， low hemo-globin at 12.2 g/dL (normal 13.3-17.5)， and low hematocrit at35.5% (normal 40.0-51.0)， while platelets were increased at470x10/L (normal 127-350)， suggestive of infection-related hemolysis and reactive thrombocytosis. The patient's HbA1c was also elevated at 7.6% (normal 4.0-6.0%)， which was sug-gestive of poor long-term glucose control.\n\n【23】Given the concerning signs suggestive of pyogenic spinal in-fection， including paraspinal， psoas， and epidural abscesses， the surgeon accordingly referred the patient to an infectious disease specialist， who the patient saw 8 days later. The in-fectious disease specialist ordered further testing， and while waiting for results， conferred with the spine surgeon， who re-filled the patient's prescription for tramadol.\n\n【24】A routine throat swab and culture were conducted， which re-vealed commensal flora. Considering the patient’s history of di-arrhea， a stool culture was also conducted， which was normal. A urine examination and culture， Widal test， and melioidosis se-rology testing (lgG， IgM) were normal. The QuantiFERON-TB test was borderline elevated (TB 1 Ag minus nil control 0.37； TB 2Ag minus nil control 0.44； normal <0.35)， suggestive of possible Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection， while the chest radiographwas normal. As the QuantiFERON-TB test can produce false-pos-itive resu lts ，and the patient had no history of， contact with， or other signs of tuberculosis， the infectious disease specialist considered this screening test to be a false positive. The spe-cialist also recommended a biopsy and culture of the paraspinal lesion； however， this was delayed upon request of the patient.\n\n【25】Throughout the course of testing with spine surgery and in-fectious disease， the chiropractor remained in contact with the patient via daily telemedicine and monitored the patient's symptoms. The patient reported a brief improvement in abil-ity to walk and climb stairs 2 weeks after initial presentation， which was followed by a relapse of symptoms.\n\n【26】During the fourth week after initial presentation to the chi-ropractor， the patient consented to a fine-needle biopsy of the lumbar paraspinal lesion. The histopathology report not-ed evidence of moderate acute inflammation， with some fi-brous tissue and skeletal muscle fibers， with foca! fat necro-sis and fibrosis， and no evidence of malignancy. On a gram stain there were 2+ white blood cells， yet no stained bacteria were evident. Culture of the biopsy material revealed S.ora-lis. Considering this finding， the specialist concluded that an oral source of S. oralis had disseminated to the spine， causing paraspinal， psoas， and epidural abscesses， likely related to the patient's gingivitis. Based on the results of antibiotic sensitiv-ity testing， the infectious disease specialist then treated the patient with oral clindamycin (150 mg) and levofloxacin (250mg) for 2 weeks while considering surgical options.\n\n【27】The patient's episodic back pain initially reduced after admin-istration of antibiotics but relapsed 6 weeks after initial pre-sentation to the chiropractor. The chiropractor， who remained in contact with the patient， referred the patient to a nearby hospital for urgent attention， where he was admitted as an inpatient. Reportedly， his laboratory testing remained abnor-mal with signs of ongoing infection. The medical team accord-ingly began a 6-week course of intravenous cephalosporins.\n\n【28】By the fourth week of intravenous antibiotics， the patient re-ported his laboratory tests had returned to normal， including markers of infection and anemia， and he felt significantly im-proved. The chiropractor had 2 virtual/telemedicine visits with the patient at weeks 2 and 4 of his hospital stay， and demon-strated exercises (pelvic tilts， gluteal stretches， and cat-cow quadruped exercise) to the patient. The patient was able to complete these exercises daily without an increase in symp-toms. He also began to walk regularly and no longer had in-creased symptoms with ambulation， although he did have residual mild neck and low back pain. The patient provided written informed consent for the publication of this case re-port， including his clinical details and imaging tests.\n\n【29】Discussion\n\n【30】This case illustrates a 60-year-old man with gingivitis and im-munocompromise related to diabetes who developed multi-focal cervical and lumbar pyogenic infection (ie， paraspinal，psoas， and epidural abscesses) shortly after COVID-19 illness. Accordingly， this case reinforces previous associations be-tween immunocompromise and opportunistic pyogenic spi-nal infection ， and adds to the growing literature showing that COVID-19 illness is another potential risk factor for these types of infections .\n\n【31】In the current case， the source of the pyogenic spinal infec-tion was confirmed as S. oralis， a commensal bacteria normal-ly occurring in the oral flora， which has been associated with opportunistic infections . It is likely that this bacte-rium spread hematogenously to the spine from the mouth. Bacteremia and end-organ infection is possible even with rou-tine dental hygiene such as toothbrushing， especially in those with gingivitis and immune compromise (eg，diabetes) such as in the current case . Further， the patient’s recent COVID-19may have been a risk factor for development of pyogenic spi-nal infection .\n\n【32】Detection of pyogenic spinal infection relies on a thorough history and examination， with attention to any red flags such as fever， drug use， immune compromise， or focal neurolog-ic deficit . Laboratory testing， including CRP， ESR， blood count， and procalcitonin， may be useful markers of spinal in-fection . In addition， blood and urine cultures should be obtained prior to antibiotic therapy in those suspected of spi-nal infection . MRI with gadolinium contrast is the criterion standard test to diagnose spinal infection due to its high sen-sitivity and specificity . For cases with equivocal or uncer-tain imaging findings， positron emission tomography CT with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose may be used . Ultimately， bacte-riological or microscopic examination of the site of spinal in-fection is necessary to confirm the diagnosis， as other testing can be unreliable .\n\n【33】Use of whole-spine MRl， as in the current case， remains some-what controversial for screening purposes given the low prob-ability of identifying serious pathology ， added cost， and increased scanning time . However， a recent review pro-posed that whole-spine imaging is useful and appropriate for evaluating suspected spinal infection as well as “skip lesions”involving multifocal spinal disease ， as in the current case. In the setting of the current case， MRI was readily available， which facilitated obtaining whole-spine MRI. Further， chiro-practors in Hong Kong can order MRI ， a management step which appeared to speed the process of identifying the pyo-genic spinal infection.\n\n【34】Antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment for pyogenic spinal infection . While the route of administration and duration of antibiotics are not well agreed-upon in the literature， a re-cent review concluded antibiotics should be used for a mini-mum of 6 weeks . When the specific bacterial agent cannotbe identified， empiric antibiotic therapy is recommended . However， when a specific agent is diagnosed， target therapy can be performed . Aspiration/drainage of spinal abscesses may be needed when they are of a larger size， which can be done surgically or percutaneously . Surgery is typically con-sidered when antibiotic treatment has failed， imaging findings show worsening， or there is spinal instability or deformity .\n\n【35】Practitioners that triage patients with spinal pain， such as chi-ropractors， should be aware that patients with pyogenic spi-nal infection may not have any overt signs of infection such as fever . Accordingly， these providers must have a high index of suspicion of risk factors for infection and other red flags such as persistence of symptoms despite previous con-servative care . Further， spinal infections are a contraindi-cation to spinal manipulative therapy ， which could exac-erbate an underlying spinal infection . Providers such as chiropractors should always refer patients suspected of pyo-genic spinal infection for urgent medical care， given the po-tential morbidity of this condition .\n\n【36】As an individual case，these findings may not be broadly gen-eralizable. Although COVID-19 appeared to be a risk factor in this patient's spinal infection， it is possible it was merely a co-incidence of timing. While larger studies have shown a gener-al association between COVID-19 and opportunistic infection， further epidemiologic research is needed to determine if this association also applies to pyogenic spinal infections. Gadolinium contrast was not used in the patient's MRI， but it seemed unnecessary to repeat the MRl with gadolinium due to the several imaging abnormalities that appeared in the non-contrast images. Instead， laboratory testing and biopsy became the next most important diagnostic steps. Although chiroprac-tors in the United States and Hong Kong can order MRI ， this may not be the case in other countries. Accordingly， chi-ropractors in other regions may have a different management strategy more reliant on referral. Certain clinical records， in-cluding a gram-stain photomicrograph and detailed inpatient notes describing the patient's intravenous antibiotic therapy， were unavailable upon request.\n\n【37】Conclusions\n\n【38】This case highlights a 60-year-old immunocompromised man with poorly controlled diabetes and gingivitis who developed low back pain 1 week after recovery from a mild course of COVID-19 illness， which was diagnosed as an opportunistic pyogenic spinal infection with multifocal involvement including paraspinal， psoas， and epidural abscesses caused by S. oralis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Multiple factors are associated with an increased risk of invasive aspergillosis， including persistent neutropenia， impaired lymphocyte engraftment following bone marrow transplantation， cytomegalovirus disease， respiratory virus infection， cytotoxic chemo-therapy， and Aspergillus colonization. Unfortunately， attempts at fungal isolation are often unsuccessful.\n\n【2】Case Report：\n\n【3】We describe a 15-year-old girl with a known case of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with unusual cause of chest infection accompanied with a persistent radiological finding that worsened with time despite multiple levels of intervention. The optimal treatment was unclear， given that all cultures were negatives and the condition did not improve. Very interesting radiological findings will be elaborated in this case. Despite the typical ra-diological findings， we struggled to confirm the underlying cause of lung infection， which was demonstrated to be Aspergittus furigatus by thoracoscopy and lavage. Eventually， when the patient started to improve， cat-astrophic bleeding occurred， confirming the angio-invasive nature of this organism.\n\n【4】Conclusions：\n\n【5】IPA is still associated with very high morbidity and mortality. A high index of suspicion is needed for such cas-es. We recommend lavage on the third or fourth day of febrile neutropenia illness in patients who did not show clear improvement with the standard neutropenia protocol， and we suggest considering combined antifungal therapies at an earlier time point. IPA is angio-invasive and can lead to catastrophic bleeding. Earlier surgical intervention might be considered， especially in refractory localized aspergillus.\n\n【6】Keywords： Febrile Neutropenia · Hemoptysis · Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis ·Pulmonary Aspergillosis\n\n【7】Abbreviations：\n\n【8】PA- pulmonary aspergillosis； IPA - invasive pulmonary aspergillosis； CT -computed tomography； RLL - right lower lobe； ANC -absolute neutrophil count； WBC - white blood cell count； BAL-bron-chioalveolar lavage/bronchoalveolar lavage； GM-galactomannan；IVIG-intravenous immunoglobulin； GCSF - granulocyte colony-stimulating factorAspergillus spp. are widespread in the environment and are commonly isolated from both the outdoor environment (eg， soil， plant debris) and indoor environments，including hospitals. Pulmonary disease is caused by Aspergillus furnigatus， which is the most common pathogen . PA is associated with a high mortality rate (generally 45%) and requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent dissemination and death . The dis-ease is characterized by angioinvasion，arteriolar thrombosis， and hematogenous dissemination. Pathologically， pulmonary findings include necrotizing bronchopneumonia， hemorrhag-ic pulmonary infarction， micro-abcesses， solitary abscesses， lobar pneumonia， and tracheobronchitis . Invasive pulmo-nary aspergillosis (IPA) is a severe disease and can be found in severely immunocompromised patients， critically ill patients， and those with chronic pulmonary diseases . Chronic nec-rotizing aspergillosis (CNA) is locally invasive and is mainly ob-served in patients with mild immunodeficiency or chronic lung disease . Symptoms of IPA are usually nonspecific and usu-ally mimic bronchopneumonia： fever unresponsive to antibi-otics， cough， sputum production， and dyspnea. Patients can also present with pleuritic chest pain (due to vascular invasion leading to thromboses that cause small pulmonary infarcts) and hemoptysis . Immunocompromised patients，especial-ly those with prolonged and profound neutropenia， are prone to systemic fungal infections， particularly invasive aspergillo-sis (IA) . Early mycological detection of Aspergillus species is the cornerstone for prompt diagnosis， appropriate treat-ment strategy， and improved survival of patients with IA .\n\n【9】We present the case of an immunocompromised patient with febrile neutropenia， respiratory symptoms not responding to antibiotics， and a persistent radiological presentation suggest-ing invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.\n\n【10】Case Report\n\n【11】A 15-year-old girl with a known case of acute myeloid leuke-mia (AML) for the last 6 months received a regular course of chemotherapy (daunorubicin， cystine arabinoside， L aspara-ginase). Seven days later， after chemotherapy， she developed fever and cough. She was noted to be neutropenic (WBC 0.1/mm3，ANC 0.0/mm3). She was admitted with febrile neutrope-nia treated empirically with vancomycin and ceftazidime. One week later， she continued to be febrile and did not respond to a change in the antibiotics to peptazocilline， gentamicin， and metronidazole and prophylactic doses of fluconazole to treat mycoses. This regimen was changed to a standard dose of am-photericin B. At the end of the second week， the patient was still febrile and neutropenic (ANC 0.0/mm) and started to ex-perience respiratory distress. Her admission chest X-ray wasentirely normal. Serial X-rays showed significant opacities in the lower lobes， and a trial of IVIG and GCSF was added to the am-photericin B regimen， with little improvement. Pulmonary con-sultation was performed. Necrotizing pneumonia was expect-ed with viral infection， fungal infection， and TB. Bronchoscopy and lavage revealed an erythematous airway with increased secretions. Microscopy， Gram staining， and cultures were all negative (including pneumocystis stains and fungal cultures)，and GM was negative from BAL (GM was not taken as a blood sample). Azithromycin and acyclovir were added after lavage， and the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for cardiorespiratory monitoring because of hypokalemia and in-creasing respiratory distress requiring oxygen supplementation only. The chest X-ray showed lower-zone infiltrates .\n\n【12】The patient was unwell， with the following vital signs： temper-ature， 38.8℃； heart rate， 120/m； respiratory rate， 30/m； satura-tion， 88% on room air， and 98% with 0.5 l/m. Vesicular breath sounds and scattered bilateral lung crackles were observed， especially at the posterior aspect of the chest. Other system-ic exam results were normal， with some pallor and mild hep-atomegaly noted. The initial blood work indicated leukopenia(WBC 0.1/mm’， neutrophils 0/mm). The Hb level was 10 g/dl and the platelet level was 150/mm3. Electrolytes were with-in normal limits， and the viral screen was negative. Her initial atrial blood gas readings revealed mild respiratory acidosis(pH 7： 34， PCO， 42， HCO， 25 mmHg). The chest X-ray showed significant bilateral lung infiltration in the middle and low-er zones. Blood cultures were negative， and the CT chest was alarming， with halo signs suggestive of invasive pulmonary as-pergillosis . Later， during hospital weeks 3-4， the le-sion progressed to a typical air-crescent sign ，and the infection progressed to a globular enhancing mass consis-tent with pseudoaneurysm formation .\n\n【13】The patient was initially admitted for febrile neutropenia and administered i.v. antibiotics. Her respiratory condition was mon-itored， as she started with mild cough and tachypnea. Despite starting the neutropenia protocol and further trials of multiple antibiotics over 4 weeks， her condition did not improve. In fact， radiological images worsened with time. Conference meetings were held to discuss the potential treatment options， and the team decided to prepare for transthoracic lung biopsy in the operating room. The patient was later developed a complica-tion of mild pneumothorax that was treated conservatively.\n\n【14】The histopathology confirmed the presence of hyphae consis-tent with Aspergillus and no evidence of malignancy . The antifungal drugs were changed to AmBisome (liposomal amphotericin) and caspofungin. The patient's temperature de-creased， and WBC counts started to increase. The patient start-ed to show clear clinical improvement. During hospital week8， the patient showed significant clinical improvement； she was afebrile and had a normal WBC count. Unfortunately，she suddenly experienced a massive hemoptysis of greater than400 ml at night. Bleeding was anticipated due to pseudoan-eurysm formation， in keeping with the angio-invasive nature of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The work-up for coagula-tion defects was negative， and platelets were normal. Other potential differential diagnoses， such as broncho-arterial fistu-la， pulmonary infarct or embolism， and organizing pneumonia， were considered. This patient was urgently taken to the oper-ating room for a right lower lobectomy with a right upper lobewedge resection as a mycotic aneurysm. She received 3 units of packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma. During the postoperative course， she was connected to a BIPAP device for 1 night and responded well. She remained hospitalized for i.v. treatment with AmBisome and caspofungin for 3 months. A repeat CT scan showed marked improvement. AmBisome was discontinued due to concern about renal adverse effects. and caspofungin continued to be administered. The duration of the treatment was several months until total recovery， in-cluding both clinical and radiological resolution， was obtained. Repeated CT was considered  and our patient was maintained on caspofungin.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a serious medical condition in pa-tients with hematological or oncological malignancies， and the mortality rate is increasing， reaching 40-50% in patients af-ter chemotherapy and 80-90% in patients after hematopoi-etic stem cell transplantation . It is well known that earlier treatment is associated with better survival， but the definitive diagnosis is difficult and often delayed . It is also impor-tant to understand the disease progression of IPA and how to manage immunodeficient patients with pulmonary infiltrate.\n\n【17】We report our case with prolonged and refractory febrile neu-tropenia that did not respond to multiple adjustments of antibiotics.\n\n【18】Although pulmonologists were involved slightly late in this case， further lavage was negative for any organisms. Such a finding places a huge burden on treating physicians and on the fam-ily， given that no clear diagnosis could explain the persistent fever. A high index of suspicion of IPA needs to be considered in the case of immunodeficient patients with fever and short-ness of breath， as noted in our case. Moreover， the initial im-ages were nonspecific. Generally， CT findings of IPA are very informative， and the finding may include well-circumscribed lesion(s) with or without a surrounding \"halo\" of ground-glass gray attenuation， air-crescent sign， and cavity formation ， all of which were positive at different stages and the diagno-sis made late， during hospital week 4. A lung CT scan should be performed in a high-risk child with febrile neutropenia >96h or with focal clinical findings. However， the appearance of any new infiltrate in chest CT in children with prolonged fe-brile neutropenia not responding to broad-spectrum antibiot-ics is a warning for potential fungal infection . The air-cres-cent sign is frequently not seen in neutropenic patients， but can appear during the recovery phase . The key in our case was that the lesion progressed from halo signs to air-cres-cent signs despite good antifungal therapy， raising the con-cern of choices of antifungal therapies. However， the incidenceof cavitation in the pediatric population appears to be signifi-cantly less than that in their adult counterparts. The air-cres-cent sign appears as a crescent-shaped area of radiolucen-cy in a region of nodular opacity. Air crescents and cavitation are typically observed in older children . However， the halo sign appears as ground-glass opacity surrounding a pulmo-nary nodule and is less specific than the air-crescent sign for invasive aspergillosis. Radiographic findings in patients with IPA include a nodule (the earliest radiographic sign)， consolida-tion， wedge-shaped infarcts， and cavitation. The involvement of infective progression in the formation of a globular enhanc-ing mass consistent with pseudoaneurysm formation indicates the angio-invasive nature of the organism. However， pulmo-nary hemorrhage is expected in the presence of large cavitat-ing lesions or consolidations located close to larger pulmonary vessels. Although it can be associated with cavitation that oc-curs with neutrophil recovery， as noted in our case， when the patient started to show some clinical improvement and res-olution of neutropenia while on the i.v. antifungal regimen， she developed severe hemoptysis. Aspergillus species are not usually recovered from the blood， but are rarely (in less than10% of patients) isolated from respiratory secretions such as sputum， and bronchoalveolar lavage can yield false-negative results . In a study showing multiple bronchoscopies per-formed in immunocompromised children， the galactomannan(GM) assay in BAL fluid had a minimal impact on the clinical decision. and antifungal agents were continued despite a neg-ative GM result in BAL fluid， as in our case . The criterion standard in the diagnosis of IPA is tissue biopsy obtained by thoracoscopic or open-lung surgery (histopathological exami-nation) . This procedure is difficult to perform in critically ill patients with significant respiratory compromise and thrombo-cytopenia . Galactomannan， a carbohydrate constituent of the Aspergillus cell wall， can also play a role in screening high-risk patients and assessing response to therapy . Serum GM assays are not routinely performed in the oncology unit due to cross-reactivity and false-positive results for patients on beta lactam drugs， such as piperacillin and tazobactam . Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become a promising di-agnostic tool for the early detection of IA . Galactomannan assays and PCR were not performed for our patient.\n\n【19】Combined antifungal therapy and early surgical excision is a feasible and effective strategy in pediatric patients with IA. Given that early definitive diagnosis is difficult， empiric admin-istration of antifungal agents has become a standard of prac-tice in neutropenic patients who remain persistently febrile despite broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy . Surgical resection of the cavity and removal of the fungal mass are in-dicated in patients with recurrent hemoptysis . However， surgery is often conducted either as an emergency proce-dure to prevent massive hemoptysis before marrow recov-ery or as an elective procedure after neutropenia resolution.\n\n【20】Patients with localized pulmonary aspergillosis treated with both antifungal drugs and early lung resection showed a re-duced progression of fungal disease at 6 months and a better overall survival compared to patients treated only with anti-fungal drugs. Resection of the fungal lesion (before bone mar-row recovery) might reduce the risk of death related to arte-rial perforation . Caspofungin and L-amphotericin B were comparable in tolerability， safety， and efficacy as empiric an-tifungal therapies for persistently febrile neutropenic pediat-ric patients， and both are known as primary antifungal regi-mens for IPA in neutropenic patients. In the present patient， these regimens were administered during the 4th week of ill-ness . A new broad-spectrum antifungal triazole，voricon-azole， has been approved as the initial treatment of invasive aspergillosis and is considered the drug of choice in many pa-tients with IPA. Patients receiving voriconazole had a higher favorable response rate at week 12 (53% versus 32% in pa-tients receiving amphotericin B) and higher 12-week survival(71% versus 58%) . Voriconazole is available in both intra-venous and oral formulations. In our case， double-agent anti-fungal therapy with AmBisone and caspofungin response re-sulted in improvements in fever and increased WBC counts. In our case， the response to therapy was complete， as all the symptoms and signs of fungal infection disappeared. The op-timal duration of antifungal treatment for invasive aspergillo-sis has not been established in pediatric patients. Aspergillus is slow growing and more difficult to eradicate because the duration of therapy can be several months. Lung resection can clear fungal infection in approximately 80% of patients. Mid-to long-term survival can be achieved if the underlying hematologic disease is under control .Our patient was urgently taken to the emergency room for a right lower lobec-tomy with a right upper lobe wedge resection for the mycotic aneurysm preceded by massive hemoptysis， which can be ex-plained by the angio-invasive nature of the disease. The con-dition was controlled in the operating room by blood transfu-sion， and surgical excision exhibited a smooth postoperative course. The patient remained on combined i.v. treatment with AmBisome and caspofungin for 3 months， then stepped down to caspofungin for 3 more months when she showed com-plete resolution of the respiratory symptoms， accompanied by marked resolution of the radiological findings.\n\n【21】Conclusions\n\n【22】IPA still has very high morbidity and mortality rates. A high index of suspicion is needed for such cases. Febrile neutrope-nia is a major risk factor for opportunistic infections， including fungal infections. We recommend lavage in the third or fourth day of illness in patients who do not show clear improvement in febrile neutropenia and suggest consideration of combined antifungal therapies as soon as possible. Radiologists can helpanticipate certain complications， such as air-crescent signs. IPA is angio-invasive and can lead to catastrophic bleeding. Earlier surgical intervention might be considered， especially in refrac-tory localized Aspergillus or if there is a question of angioinva-sion. Serial case conferences are recommended for such pa tients to discuss the best therapeutic option； full recovery is possible despite the high mortality rate.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

In 2007， a Zika virus outbreak in French Polynesia was as-sociated with neurologic complications， especially Guillain-Barre syndrome . In 2015， the first cases of Zika virus were reported in Brazil. An unexpected rise in congenital micro-cephaly was noticed， and a link between these 2 occurrences was proposed . This association was subsequently con-firmed， and the congenital Zika syndrome was described . Viral transmission occurred primarily through mosquito bites， although sexual passage through semen where the virus can persist for up to six months， vertical transmission through the placenta， and by transfusion of blood components was also confirmed . Zika virus was also been reported in breast milk， although this mode of transmission to the newborn is still controversial .\n\n【7】We now report a case of secondary microcephaly in a baby whose mother was positive for Zika virus only in her breast milk and who delivered a prior baby with severe microcephaly.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 30-year-old female became pregnant again 19 months after delivery of a baby with severe microcephaly. The first baby， a girl， was positive for lgG antibody to Zika virus and to chikun-gunya virus although the mother was antibody-negative to both. The second pregnancy was uncomplicated with 5 normal ges-tational ultrasounds. A female baby was delivered by cesarean section at a gestational age by ultrasound of 39 weeks and by last menstrual period of 39 weeks and 6 days. Birth weight was2650 g (z score=-1288)； length 47 cm (z score=-1.2831)and head circumference 33 cm (z score=-0.379). All these parame-ters were considered normal by INTERGROWTH-21 standards. Both mother and baby were negative by STORCH (acronym for disease group comprising syphilis， toxoplasmosis，other infec-tions， rubella， cytomegalovirus infection， and herpes simplex). Blood， saliva， urine， and colostrum were collected for labora-tory examinations. Analysis of samples by reverse transcrip-tase -polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed the pres-ence of Zika virus only in breast milk. Both mother and baby were Zika virus-negative by serology and RT-PCR.\n\n【10】The infant was exclusively breastfed since delivery. A re-evalu-ation at 23 days after birth revealed that the baby's head cir-cumference remained at 33 cm (z score=-2.330). This lack of head growth was consistent with a diagnosis of secondary mi-crocephaly  as defined by the World Health Organization.\n\n【11】Other possible causes of microcephaly such as abnormal ven-tricles， craniosynostosis， congenital hypothyroidism， were excluded.\n\n【12】A final evaluation， at 7 months 29 days showed a weight of8.1 kg； length 68.5 cm and head circumference 40.5 cm， with z scores of 0.20；-0.02； -2.10， respectively. This continued re-duced head growth confirmed the diagnosis of secondary micro-cephaly. Additional neurological examinations were all normal.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】After the 2015 Zika virus outbreak in Brazil， many cases asso-ciating microcephaly with Zika virus infection were reported. Subseguent studies were conducted to define the mechanism(s) of mother-fetal transmission and identify additional neurologi-cal consequences for the fetus. Considering that Zika virus can be transmitted vertically or intrapartum/perinatally， it is diffi-cult to define when transmission occurs.\n\n【15】Colt et al. reported the presence of Zika virus RNA in breast milk from 3 infected mothers. Two of the babies had evidence of Zika virus exposure by serology and/or by its transient de-tection in urine. All 3 babies remained healthy and asymptom-atic . In the present case， while there was no molecular or immunological evidence of Zika virus in the newborn. Her de-velopment of secondary microcephaly only after delivery， the exclusion of other apparent causes， and the development of Zika virus-related severe microcephaly in a previous baby from the same mother strongly suggests that the baby became in-fected with Zika virus that affected brain development after ingestion of breast milk. Reasons for the mother’s failure to respond immunologically to Zika virus are unknown. She was not immunosuppressed and had normal levels of antibodies to other infectious agents. The mother's possible exposure to other flaviviruses might have masked or diminished her immune response to Zika virus reinfection prior to her sec-ond pregnancy and a possible mechanism for intra-familial transmission of Zika virus might have been Zika virus persis-tent infection in her partner’s semen. It remains to be deter-mined if Zika virus was present in her milk as a free virus or was associated with macrophages， lymphocytes，or other cells. Unfortunately， in the present case we were unable to evalu-ate these possibilities.\n\n【16】Differences in the severity of microcephaly in the 2 babies might have been due to the simultaneous present of a sec-ond flavivirus， chikungunya virus， in the first but not the sec-ond neonate. Concurrent infection by more than one flavivirus has been shown to alter immune responses .\n\n【17】Detection of Zika virus exclusively in breast milk after a sec-ond delivery， coupled with the child being born healthy but developing microencephaly only 1 month after delivery which persisted to date， was consistent with the possible transmis-sion of Zika virus to the baby in breast milk and the initia tion of neurological damage only after birth. The World Health Organization continues to support breastfeeding， considering the benefits of this practice， even for those mothers with sus-pected or confirmed Zika virus infection . Further studies are needed to better define the dynamics of Zika virus trans-mission via breast milk and its potential harm to newborns.\n\n【18】Our data were obtained under the Cohort Zika Jundiai Consortium， already approved on ethical committee (CAAE53248616200005412)； Research Ethics Review Committee(WHO ERC)， World Health Organization (ZIKV100/2018).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}

Accelerated CAV leads to al-lograft failure within 1 year after receiving a normal angiogram result. Viruses can contribute to CAV develop-ment， but CAV after SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been reported to date.\n\n【2】Case Report： A 48-year-old man， 5 years after OHT for non-ischemic cardiomyopathy， was admitted to the Cardiac Care Unit with 3 days of abdominal pain， dyspnea， and palpitations. His medical history included hyperlipidemia and in-sulin-dependent diabetes. He was compliant with all medications. Two months prior， he had a mild COVID-19case. An echocardiogram and coronary angiogram 6 and 9 months prior， respectively， were unremarkable.\n\n【3】Right and left heart catheterization demonstrated increased filling pressures， a cardiac index of 1.7 L/ml/m， and diffuse vasculopathy most severe in the LAD artery. Flow could not be restored despite repeated balloon-ing and intra-catheter adenosine. Empiric ionotropic support， daily high-dose methylprednisolone， and plas-mapheresis were started. A few days later， the patient had cardiac arrest requiring venoarterial extracorporeal membranous oxygenation. Given CAV's irreversibility， re-transplantation was considered， but the patient had an episode of large-volume hemoptysis and remained clinically unstable for transplant. The patient died whileon palliative care.\n\n【4】Conclusions： Our patient developed accelerated CAV 2 months after having COVID-19. While CAV has known associations with certain viruses， its incidence after SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. Further research is needed to deter-mine if prior SARS-CoV-2 infection is a risk factor for development of CAV in OHT recipients.\n\n【5】Keywords：Full-text PDF\n\n【6】Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a serious complication for orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) recipients. The patho-physiology of CAV is thought to be due to the recipient's im mune system reacting to the donor’s foreign heart tissue， leading to concentric fibromuscular hyperplasia of the intima of the coronary vasculature of the transplanted heart . CAV can be devastating for many OHT recipients as its onset can be early， presenting within years of the transplant， and is per-vasive and angiographically detectable in approximately one-third of OHT patients within 5 years and in almost halfwithin10 years . CAV is difficult to manage， with no strongly effec-tive treatment， often leading to aggressive percutaneous cor-onary intervention or redo heart transplantation. Accelerated CAV is characterized by an even worse prognosis， leading to allograft failure within 1 year . The risk of CAV is increased by traditional， non-immunogenic risk factors (eg， age， obesity， male sex， diabetes， and hyperlipidemia)， immunologic risk fac-tors， and donor-specific risk factors . Notably， viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) have also been implicated in CAV. Acute COVID-19， due to infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)， has been associated with increased risk of mortality for OHT recipients ， but to date， no association has been demonstrated between SARS-CoV-2 infection and CAV. We re-port， to the best of our knowledge， the first case of accelerat-ed CAV in an OHT recipient after COVID-19.\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】A 48-year-old man with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyop-athy status-post OHT 5 years prior presented to the Emergency Department with a 3-day history of palpitations， shortness of breath， and chest and epigastric pain . His past medical his-tory was notable for an OHT (donor and recipient were CMV-and HCV-negative)， insulin-dependent diabetes， and hyperlipid-emia. His post-transplant course was notable for only 1 episode of resolved acute cellular rejection early after transplantation and mild COVID-19 illness， defined as COVID-19 not requiring anti-viral medication or hospitalization， 2 months prior to pre-sentation. He was adherent to his immune suppression regi-men， which included tacrolimus and mycophenolate. He also took aspirin， glimepiride， metformin， rosuvastatin， and flucon-azole. He was unvaccinated against COVID-19. He reported no use of tobacco， alcohol， or recreational drugs. Echocardiograms and coronary angiograms were obtained annually for moni-toring of the transplanted graft. The echocardiogram obtained6 months prior， and all previous echocardiograms， were nor-mal except for mild mitral regurgitation and mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. All prior coronary angiograms in-cluding the latest， from 9 months prior， obtained for annualscreening of the transplanted graft， showed no significant epi-cardial coronary artery disease. His vital signs were notable for an increased heart rate of 130 beats per minute， a blood pres-sure of 124/96 mmHg， a respiratory rate of 26， and an oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. His physical exam was notable for distended neck veins and right upper quadrant and epi-gastric pain. He was fully alert and oriented. Initial laboratory studies revealed a normal complete blood count and normal renal function. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis and eleva-tions in transaminases were present. Serum troponin I was elevated to 10.6 ng/ml (normal <0.04 ng/ml). Tacrolimus lev-el was within his therapeutic goal. Electrocardiogram showed junctional tachycardia.\n\n【9】The patient was given 1 liter of intravenous (I) fluids， aspi-rin 325 mg， acetaminophen 1 gm， and morphine 4 mg IV. He then underwent an expedited right and left heart catheteriza-tion. Mean pulmonary artery pressure was 37 mmHg，and car-diac index was calculated at 1.7 L/min/m²and 1.6 L/min/m² by thermodilution and Fick methods， respectively. Angiographic evaluation of the coronary arteries was notable for diffuse vasculopathy with severe disease in the first obtuse margin-al branch， first diagonal artery， and the apical left anterior de-scending (LAD) artery . The right coronary artery (RCA) also showed signs of vasculopathy and had 20% stenosis. Flow was unable to be restored to the LAD artery despite attempts at ballooning and administration of intra-coronary adenosine.\n\n【10】Methylprednisolone 500 mg daily and a milrinone 0.2 mcg/kg/min infusion were started. The next day， an endomyocardial biopsy was obtained， which revealed pAMR1 antibody-me-diated rejection without evidence of acute cellular rejection. Plasma exchange was then initiated for a planned 5-day course. Methylprednisolone was transitioned to a prednisone taper. The patient appeared to improve and milrinone had begun to be weaned when he had a cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity initially then ventricular fibrillation. Advance cardiovas-cular life support was performed for 30 minutes until venoar-terial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) could be initiated. Following ECMO， the patient's course was complicat-ed by large-volume hemoptysis， multiple episodes of ventric-ular arrhythmia， and severely elevated pulmonary pressures.\n\n【11】Over the next several days the patient's mental status im-proved， and he was extubated. However， he then experienced recurrent large-volume hemoptysis. A bronchoscopy revealed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage presumed to be secondary to el-evated pulmonary pressures in the setting of continued acute heart failure. Unfortunately， his hemoptysis was not able to be controlled and he was considered too unstable for cardi-ac transplantation. The patient died on hospital day 29 after transitioning to palliative care. Figure 2 summarizes the time-line of events.\n\n【12】The family requested an autopsy study， which revealed severe cardiac allograft vasculopathy and acute myocardial infarction. All epicardial coronary arteries and their branches showed in-volvement of CAV， with maximally up to 90% stenosis of the distal LAD artery， left circumflex artery， and RCA. Microscopic examination showed concentric intimal proliferation of the LAD artery with sparing of the elastic lamina， and an intramyocar-dial artery with intimal proliferation and sparse mural chron-ic inflammation . The myocardium showed near-cir-cumferential， subendocardial-sparing coagulative necrosis of the left ventricle， with hypereosinophilic cytoplasm， loss of nu-clei， edema， hemorrhage， and focal inflammation， consistent with acute myocardial infarct from global ischemia .\n\n【13】There was no evidence of acute cellular rejection or antibody-mediated rejection. The lungs showed patchy organizing pneu-monia with evidence of acute hemorrhage.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】We describe a case of accelerated CAV that developed several years after initial transplantation， possibly attributable to the patient's recent mild COVID-19 infection. We discuss how in the context of normal diagnostic testing 6-9 months prior to the development of CAV， the patient's recent COVID-19 may have contributed to his rapid progression of CAV， leading todeath. We also review the latest evidence for the detection and management of CAV.\n\n【16】COVID-19 illness can present with a wide range of clinical out-comes. Given their immunos uppressed status， OHT recipients faced COVID-19-related fatality rates of up to 25-30% prior to widespread vaccination efforts . CAV may increase the risk of mortality from COVID-19 in OHT recipients， but whether COVID-19 can precipitate accelerated CAV remains unknown.\n\n【17】CAV most commonly progresses over years following a trans-plant， with 8% of patients having angiographically detect-able CAV within 1 year， 32% within 3 years， and 43% within10 years， thus allowing time for detection and treatment . In contrast， accelerated CAV classically develops within 1 year after an inciting event or trigger and in some cases can oc-cur within months of a normal angiogram . CAV is thought to be driven by endothelial cell injury triggering host immune factor recruitment， which in turn leads to smooth muscle pro-liferation in the intima of the vessel wall. Identified triggers of cell injury include viral infections and ischemia-reperfusion injury， as well as classic risk factors such as hyperlipidemia， diabetes， and hypertension . It is unclear what causes acceleration of the rate of CAV.\n\n【18】In our case， the patient was 5 years post-transplantation and had a completely normal angiogram and echocardiogram 9and 6 months prior， respectively， before presenting with car-diogenic shock due to severely stenosed coronary arteries. Given the temporal distance from his transplant， rapid pro-gression at this time point was unusual， although his pre-ex-isting hyperlipidemia and diabetes may have increased his risk. Additionally， although not yet associated with CAV， it is pos-sible the patient's SARS-CoV-2 infection 2 months prior may have represented an inciting trigger for the rapid development of CAV. In other words， in this vulnerable patient with pre-ex-isting risk factors for the development of CAV， the patient’s recent infection with SARS-CoV-2 may have catalyzed the ac-celerated development of CAV.\n\n【19】On endomyocardial biopsy， accelerated CAV may present with concentric intimal proliferation and inflammation resulting in an almost 100% luminal occlusion within intramyocardial cor-onary microvessels . Histologically， the hallmarks of accel-erated CAV include active intimal and transmural vasculitis. peri-adventitial inflammation， and in some cases， shallow mu-ral thrombus . Autopsy of our patient showed similar find-ings， although no mural thrombus was present.\n\n【20】While no direct evidence implicates COVID-19 in the devel-opment of accelerated CAV， COVID-19-induced graft dysfunc-tion has been associated with corneal， kidney， liver， and lung transplants.\n\n【21】In a 32-year-old man with a prior keratoplasty and COVID-19， Singh and Mathur describe the mechanism behind acute graft rejection of the corneal transplant as initial invasion via at-tachment to specific angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors present in corneal and conjunctival epithelium， fol-lowed by “cytokine storm” . This form of immune system dysfunction presenting as overproduction of proinflammatory markers such as interleukin (IL)-1， IL2，IL-6， and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-o and an increased rate of differentiation to CD4+T lymphocytes overwhelmed the naturalimmune regulation of the cornea， resulting in graft destruction .\n\n【22】Similarly， 2 patients with COVID-19 after kidney transplant had elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP)， erythrocyte sedimentation rate， and IL-6， suggesting a hyperinflammato-ry state in the development of graft dysfunction . This phenomenon of allograft rejection following COVID-19 was also described in liver transplant patients. However， to the best of our knowledge， no study has yet described the development of lung allograft failure after COVID-19 infection despite the virus's predilection for the lung and the presence of elevated serum D-dimer， IL-6， lactate dehydrogenase， and CRP in this population . Our patient acquired a mild SARS-CoV-2infection (not requiring anti-viral medications or hospitaliza-tion). In greater than 50% of cases of mild COVID-19， inflam-matory markers (eg， IL-6， CRP， ferritin) are elevated； therefore， our patient may have developed CAV secondary to the incit-ing inflammation from COVID-19.\n\n【23】Potential Mechanisms for COVID-19-Induced Accelerated CAV\n\n【24】After heart transplantation， patients are placed on an immu-nosuppressive pharmacologic regimen to prevent the develop ment of CAV mediated by an immune response to the donor's foreign heart tissue. This regimen usually includes a calcineu-rin inhibitor (eg， tacrolimus)， mycophenolate， and occasionally a proliferation signal inhibitor (eg， sirolimus or everolimus) . Unfortunately， this intentional suppression of the immune sys-tem can predispose OHT recipients to contract COVID-19 via a reduced ability to combat the infection.\n\n【25】Wh SARRSS-CoV-2 infects the susceptible host， evidence sug-gests that the virus enters endothelial cells via binding of its spike protein to the ACE2 receptor in tissues with high ACE2expression， such as the heart . Endothelial cells nor-mally participate in inflammatory reactions and procoagulant responses， but ACE2-mediated entry of SARS-CoV-2 into en-dothelial cells can cause endothelial overactivation and dys-function.\n\n【26】Specifically， COVID-19-induced endothelial dysfunction can lead to increased autoimmunity via overactivationof proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1， IL-2， IL-6， and TNF-o . This cytokine storm results in an inflamed endo-thelium， increased vessel permeability， a hypercoagulable state， and excessive leukocyte chemotaxis .\n\n【27】In fact， studies have shown that increasing levels of circulat-ing endothelial cells in COVID-19 patients are directly corre-lated with increased proinflammatory cytokines from acute infection through the recovery phase， suggesting that endo thelial dysfunction not only leads to production of cytokines but is also propagated by cytokines .\n\n【28】Although these changes may be reversible initially， in the set-ting of persistent endothelial dysfunction the increased im-mune response to donor tissue can lead to development of intimal proliferation，increased intimal thickness， and luminal occlusion characteristic of CAV.\n\n【29】Importantly， the mechanism outlined above can be induced by both mild and severe cases of COVID-19. Serologic testing of patients with mild and severe COVID-19 have yielded sig-nificantly higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6， CRP， and TNF-o. compared to healthy controls more than50% of the time It is unknown at this time whether vaccination against COVID-19 can protect patients from pos-sible COVID-19-induced CAV， but vaccination has been shown to decrease infection severity in both immune-competent and immune-compromised populations .\n\n【30】Taken together， these potential mechanisms may explain why our patient， given his immune-suppressed state aftertransplant along with pre-existing risk factors for CAV (eg， insulin-depen-dent diabetes and hyperlipidemia)， may have developed an ac-celerated case of CAV incited by his recent SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【31】We acknowledge the above-average rate of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in heart transplant recipients given their immunosup-pressed state； however， we report the first known case of ac-celerated CAV development after SARS-CoV-2 infection in an OHT recipient. We can only speculate as to why this phenom-enon is not more common. It is possible that many OHT re-cipients who contract SARS-CoV-2 die from COVID-19-related complications prior to the development of CAV. It is also pOS-sible that the temporal relationship between COVID-19 and CAV has gone unrecognized or been under-detected. Or it could simply be that， despite the increased probability of COVID-19in OHT recipients， infection with SARS-CoV-2 inciting the de-velopment of CAV is rare. This demonstrates a need for fur-ther investigation into the relationship between COVID-19 and CAV， especially given the established link between other viral illnesses and the consequent development of CAV.\n\n【32】Mechanism for Other Viruses and CAV\n\n【33】Other viral agents have also been implicated in the development of accelerated CAV， including herpes-simplex virus-1 (HSV-1)， herpes-simplex virus-2 (HSV-2)， Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)， and CMV. These viruses， and even bacteria such as Chlamydia preu-moniae and Helicobacter pylori， are associated with increased cardiovascular risk and levels of CRP， and an increasing to-tal pathogen load is an effective predictor of severity of risk. Acute CMV infection specifically can induce inflam-mation within the subendothelial wall of the allograft， lead-ing to enhanced allograft dysfunction and rejection . After this phenomenon was observed clinically， researchers were able to replicate an acute infection with CMV in rats，demon-strating that an early inflammatory response in the adventi-tia and intima of the aorta and cardiac allograft resulted in increased intimal thickness and increased luminal occlusion. These changes are driven by increased leukocytes and cyto-kines， accelerating acute allograft rejection . Additionally， there is also evidence that hearts from HCV-positive donors have an increased rate of CAV at 1 year after transplant .\n\n【34】Detection and Management of CAV\n\n【35】The symptomatology of CAV is wide-ranging， and most pa-tients do not present acutely. Rather， patients may be largely asymptomatic， with CAV often found incidentally. Therefore， diagnosis must be based on more than just clinical criteria . Coronary angiography with or without intravascular ultrasound(VUS) imaging remains the initial test for diagnosis of CAV， with a positive finding defined as a maximal intimal thickness of greater than or equal to 0.5 mm . Optical coherence to-mography also can play an important role in determining the progression of CAV .\n\n【36】Non-invasive modalities include dobutamine stress echocardiog-raphy (DSE)， radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging utilizing either positron emission tomography or single-photon emission computed tomography (CT)， coronary CT angiography， and cardi-ac magnetic resonance imaging . While these modalities are all gaining popularity， they demonstrate only a modest sensitiv-ity and specificity in a handful of studies and further research is necessary to adequately judge their utility in CAV diagnosis.\n\n【37】Prevention of CAV begins with immunosuppressionimmediately after transplant， typically with a calcineurin inhibitor and my-cophenolate mofetil . Control of hypertension and diabetes is also crucial. Notably， statin therapy has become a main-stay for CAV prevention by reducing the incidence of allograft rejection and progression of CAV through anti-inflammatory， immunomodulatory， and cholesterol-lowering effects . When accompanied with acute antibody or cellular rejection， management of CAV may include additional treatment withhigh-dose steroids， intravenous immunoglobulin， thymoglobu-lin， and plasmapheresis . Percutaneous coronary interven-tion may provide temporary benefit by revascularizing stenotic focal lesions， but CAV generally results in diffuse and progres-sive disease . Redo OHT is most often the only definitive treatment . Many of these strategies were attempted in our patient， but unfortunately were insufficient to prevent car-diac failure from stenosed coronary arteries. Additionally， clin-ical instability precluded redo OHT in this case.\n\n【38】Conclusions\n\n【39】CAV remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the years following successful OHT. We describe， to the best ofour knowledge， the first reported case of possible COVID-19-induced accelerated CAV in an OHT patient with pre-existing risk factors for CAV and review the pathophysiology， detec-tion， and management of this disease. Further research into the early diagnosis and prevention of CAV is necessary to en-sure that OHT recipients are correctly managed in the era of COVID-19 and in the face of many other viral infections， which demonstrate a clear and present danger to this immunosup-pressed population.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "acjr_mdpub_cases", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}
