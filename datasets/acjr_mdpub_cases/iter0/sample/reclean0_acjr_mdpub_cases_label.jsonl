Compared with squamous cell carcinoma， the rhabdomyosarcoma is less differentiat-ed. It grows rapidly and invasively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>，but laryngeal rhab-domyosarcoma is rarely involved in metastasis and is con-sidered to be easy to manage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【28】The most widely accepted classification for rhabdomyosar-coma is that recommended by Horn and Enterline 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.This system classifies rhabdomyosarcoma into 3 basic histologi-cal types： embryonal， alveolar and pleomorphic. The bot-ryoid subtype is accepted presently as a variant of the em-bryonal category 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Treatment for laryngeal RA has been varied： aggressive pro-cedure and partial excision； endoscopic procedure； or ra-diotherapy combined with chemotherapy； usually neck dis-section is needed. The presentation of RA in the head and neck is not uncommon， but laryngeal involvement is rare； moreover， the pleomorphic RA is extremely unusual. The total literature on laryngeal RA is very small. All the simple case reports in Chinese journals have been published with-out English abstract available， and thus the rare cases of this disease from China will never be known to physicians from other countries. We present a case of laryngeal RA in an adult and review the associated Chinese case reports in order to enrich the scant literature on this rare disease.\n\n【30】CASE REPORT\n\n【31】A 47-year-old man was admitted to our department with a complaint of 5 months progressive hoarseness not assaci-ated with sore throat， cough， sputum production or fever. He had never used his voice professionally (eg， as a singer or lecturer) but had been a light smoker for 10 years， and he did not drink alcohol. A lack of response to treatment with antibiotics was also documented. Examination by fiber-optic laryngoscope and computed tomography revealed a neoplasm in the right larynx. He had been given a local ex-cision by another hospital on the clinical diagnosis of“pol-yps\" and the removed specimen was confirmed histopath-ologically as \"rhabdomyosarcoma\". The tumor relapsed 1week later and grew rapidly from 0.5 cm to around 1.5cm in length during just 4 weeks. He was referred to our hospi-tal and was told the cancer should be irradiated.\n\n【32】The radiologist identified it as an exceedingly rare disease and unsuited to treatment by irradiation alone， so an oto-laryngologist was consulted. The patient’s mother had com-mitted suicide 10 years ago because of throat cancer’(no surgery， no histopathology) that lead to severe dysphagia and dyspnea； his father died of uncontrolled rectal can-cer (by surgery and histopathologic diagnosis) 4 years ago. Because of the dire family history， the patient and his fam-ily members insisted on \"radical surgery”.\n\n【33】The microlaryngoscope displayed a grey-whitish neoplasm seated on the left vocal cord from the anterior one-third to the arytenoid and interarytenoid regions， with broad base and smooth surface； there was a small ulceration at the tip， probably due to the previous biopsy. The left vocal cord had\n\n【34】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.Photomicrographs of the mabdomyosarcoma from present case consisting of pleomorphictumor cells (H&E，objective×10).</u>\n\n【35】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2.Photomicrographs ofthe mabdomyosarcoma from present case consisting of pleomorphic tumor cells (H&E，objective×40).</u>\n\n【36】been paralyzed. The piriform sinuses， postcricoid area， and subglottis were all negative. There was no palpable lymph node in the bilateral neck and this was confirmed by cervi-cal enhanced computed tomography scan.\n\n【37】Chest roentgenography， sonography of the liver and spleen， and barium swallow X-ray imaging results were all normal.\n\n【38】Five days after admission to the ENT department， the pa-tient was given a total laryngectomy and left ipsilateraljug-ulodigastric lymph node excision for biopsy under general anesthesia； there was not modifying neck dissection. The gross and microscopic examination of the removed laryn-geal specimen confirmed entire excision of the tumor； the resected CLN (cervical lymph nodes) were confirmed to be chronically inflamed.\n\n【39】Because the patient did not consent， the radiotherapy and chemotherapy were not given. From then on the fol-low-up has been continued for 34 months without finding of recurrence and metastases. The patient speaks with an electrolarynx.\n\n【40】Table 1.

Microscopically， the tumor cells were of large size， in a variety of shapes including fusiform， round， racquet-like，polygon， and tadpole-shaped；\n\n【44】they were arranged randomly， with deep eosinophilic cy-toplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei. More than l nucle-us that was lecated marginally could be seen inside a cell. Some cells exhibited fine strias. The immunohistochemical\n\n【45】staining for Vimentin and o-Actin was positive； nest-shaped positive for SMA and Desmin； some of the large tumor cells were positive for myosin. Negative staining for pan-CK CK7， S-100， and EMA； the tumor cell stained negative for CD68， but the background cell was positive for CD68； CD34 stain-ing was negative for tumor cells.\n\n【46】The final diagnosis was laryngeal pleomorphic rhabdomyo-sarcoma.\n\n【47】DISCUSSION\n\n【48】RA is a malignant neoplasm originating from soft tissue； 40%arising on the head and neck 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， and often present on chil-dren and adolescents； whereas the pleomorphic RA mainly present in adults. RA of the larynx is rare， and pleomorphic RA of the larynx is extremely scarce 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Embryonal and al-veolar RA is a common malignant mesenchymal neoplasm in children， but is rare in adults. The most common type of laryngeal RA is embryonal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Adult pleomorphic rhab-domyosarcoma is a highly aggressive neoplasm that grows quickly and metastasizes early 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，8\\]</u>.\n\n【49】Laryngeal RA is limited by the space of the larynx， so most are small， about 0.5~3.0 cm in diameter. Immunohistochemical examination is essential to differentiate RA with leiomyosar-coma， malignant fibrous histiocytoma， and malignant mes-enchymoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In immunohistochemical phenotype，the embryonal and the alveolar are similar to the pleomorphic， but more primitive in cellular configuration and with more consistent nuclei； sometimes the cytoplasm manifests deep eosinophilia in the differentiated cell type.\n\n【50】The tumor cells of the alveolar type have deep stained large nuclei with less cytoplasm， the cells arranged as a solid cell nest or alveolar-shaped structure； the genetic analysis disclos-es the specific translocation in t(2；13). The case we present has a family history of malignant tumors； whether this implies a genetic factor in this disease needs further investigation.\n\n【51】Surgery has been considered the first choice of treatment for laryngeal RA. However， the conservative procedure has been preferred to spare the function of the larynx， followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\n\n【52】Being scared by his family history of malignant tumors，our patient preferred aggressive surgery. He refused chemother-apy and radiotherapy but cooperated with us for follow-up， and has survived thus far without recurrence and metasta-ses for 34 menths.\n\n【53】We reviewed the associated literature published in Chinese during 1979-2009， and obtained 16 papers and 17 patients. We searched the CAJD 通用删除1(英):<u>(China Academic Journal Network Publishing Database， www.cnki.net)</u>， which has col-lected 43，243，968 Chinese articles from 1979 to present. We used the search terms larynx'and ‘rhabdomyosarco-ma'or 'sarcoma'.\n\n【54】We found 9 embryonal cases (5 children or adolescents， 4adults)， 2 alveolar cases (adults)， and 4 pleomorphic cases(all adults， including the present case).\n\n【55】Paulino et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u> concluded that RA in the head and neck has a low risk of metastases， and that elective neck dissec-tion is not essential. Da Mosto 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> reviewed 11 cases of la-ryngeal RA and found only 1 case of metastasis with 2 CLN and without distance metastasis； only 1 of the 6 cases who had been followed-up died of the disease. But 4 of the 17reviewed patients had CLN metastases， l had distant me-tastases， and l had comorbidity of lung cancer. All the pa-tients with metastases died of primary disease. Among the4 patients with metastases， 2 patients were treated with only radiotherapy， l with only node excision and thyrotomy， and l with only chemotherapy.\n\n【56】Among all the 18 cases， 6 survived during follow-up， 7 died， and 5 were unreported. Out of the 6 surviving patients， l was treated with chemotherapy plus radiotherapy l with only par-tial laryngectomy， l with local excision followed by chemo-therapy plus radiotherapy， l with partial laryngectomy plus chemotherapy， l total laryngectomy plus chemotherapy，and the present case was treated with total laryngectomy and CLN biopsy but was negative under microscope. Three of them underwent surgery with adjuvant cheme- and radiotherapy.\n\n【57】During the last 30 years， only 18 laryngeal RA cases have been reported in Chinese publications， suggesting the rar-ity of th is disease. Among the 17 cases， 12 were adults. This differs from the English literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， and the real reasons that lead to the difference are not clear， but probably are attributable to the conservative attitude of Chinese parents regarding surgery for their children.\n\n【58】The rhabdomyosarcomas represent a cluster of aggressive diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>； but laryngeal RA seems to be non-aggres-sive， with fewer reported metastases. The frame of larynge-al cartilage may confine the growing neoplasm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Five pa-tients of our review had metastases (4 in CLN， 1 in lung)， and all 5 died soon after being diagnosed； however， all 5cases were reported in the 1980's. Due to economic and cultural factors， some Chinese patients with malignant tu-mors， especially in rural areas， delay seeking medical atten-tion until the disease reaches an advanced stage； which is one of the reasons why our reviewed cases had a high fre-quency of metastases and mortality. None of the 4 patients who had CLN metastases underwent eligible neck dissec-tion， and all of them died of the disease.\n\n【59】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【60】To summarize， evidence-based protocol for treatment of laryngeal RA is still lacking due to the rarity of this disease通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Surgical excision with wide margins for the tumor ad-juvant by radiotherapy is optimal nowadays； and the ben-efit of chemotherapy is controversial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Neck dissection is essential in cases of metastasized CLN. An organ-sparing strategy for treatment of RA in the larynx should be serious-ly considered on the basis of entire tumor removal. Total laryngectomy may avoid morbidity caused by radiothera-py， but sacrifices the function of the larynx. Local excision alone or simple radiotherapy should be absolutely avoided.\n\n【61】REFERENCES：\n\n【62】2\\. Q. Diehn KW， Hyams V.

The stinger was removed in the Emergency Department， and topical antibiotic and anti-inflammatory treatment with corticosteroid were given. There were no compli-cations in this case. However， review of the literature has shown that although the outcome from ocular bee stings can be mild， as in this case， ocular bee stings can result in severe visual symptoms that require amni-otic membrane transplant (AMT). Management commonly includes removal of the stinger and both topical and systemic treatment with corticosteroids. The main complications include cataracts， inflammation of the ante-rior chamber， optic neuropathies， and changes in ocular pressure.\n\n【21】Conclusions：\n\n【22】Ocular bee stings have been rarely described in the literature， and the management remains controversial. As this case has shown， removal of the stinger and the use of topical treatment with antibiotics and cortico-steroids can prevent potentially serious complications that may affect vision.

Although rare， ocular bee stings can result in sig nificant complications， including the spread of venom and its components， particularly when the sting is not removed quickly. Although cases of ocular bee stings have been described in the literature， there have only been five previously published reports of conjunctival bee stings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-6\\]</u>， and only one with conjunctival bee sting with retention of the stinger 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The management ocular bee sting remains controversial， and there are no estab-lished clinical recommendations for treatment of these lesions.\n\n【26】A case of conjunctival bee sting with retention of the stinger for 48 hours is presented with a review of the literature on the complications and management of ocular bee sting injury.\n\n【27】Case Report\n\n【28】A 22-year-old professional beekeeper attended our ophthal-mic Emergency Department after being stung in the right eye48 hours previously. Given the profession of the patient and the remaining bee abdomen still attached to the stinger， this injury was presumed to be from a bee sting. However， no ad-ditional studies were undertaken to identify that the stinger was due to a bee. The bee sting resulted in a red and very painful eye with photophobia and the sensation of a conjunc-tival foreign body.\n\n【29】On clinical examination， the patient's visual acuity was normal(20/20) without any optical correction. On examination of the right eye， the bee stinger was seen to have penetrated the right conjunctiva at the periphery of the cornea at the 6 o'clock posi-tion and at 2 mm from the limbus. The stinger pointed towards the limbus and did not injure the sclera， but was associated with significant conjunctival hyperemia. The use of fluorescein eye drops (Fluoresceine sodique Faure 0.5%) showed a small conjunctival defect with retention of fluorescein in a small sub-conjunctival pocket surrounding the stinger .\n\n【30】The cornea was not injured， the anterior chamber was not in-flamed， and there was no sign of infection or intraocular in-flammation.Intraocular pressure was normal.\n\n【31】The stinger was immediately removed with forceps (Visitec Forceps， Abingdon， Oxon， UK) under a slit lamp， after instil-lation of 1% tetracaine (Laboratoires Thea， Clermont-Ferrand， France). The stinger was completely removed.\n\n【32】No stitches were needed on the conjunctiva. Topical treatment of an antibiotic combined with corticosteroids for use four\n\n【33】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

The patient was not hospitalized but attended daily follow-up visits following removal of the stinger， and then every two days， eight days， 15 days， and then at one month. At Day 2 of follow-up， no complications were found， and all symptoms had disappeared. At one week after removal of the conjunctival bee stinger， the conjunctiva of the right eye ap-peared normal .\n\n【36】Discussion\n\n【37】During a bee sting， the stinger passes through the tissue structures and attaches like a harpoon， preventing its re-moval. The bee is forced to lose its stinger and part of its\n\n【38】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3. Simplified anatomy of the bee， showing the dorsal</u>\n\n【39】view.

The stinger contains a pocket of venom released from the abdomen of the bee， which is propelled by contraction for about 30 to 60 seconds， including after the bee releases the stinger  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In some cases， including the pres-ent case， the withdrawal of the stinger， and topical treatment with steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and antibiotics is sufficient to treat the bee sting. In more severe cases， surgi-cal treatment may be necessary， including penetrating kera-toplasty or Descemet stripping automated endothelial kera-toplasty (DSAEK).\n\n【43】Review of the literature has identified 35 previous publica-tions that have included 56 reported cases of ocular bee stings. However， only five previous publications of conjunctival bee stings have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-6\\]</u>， and only one previous re-port has been of conjunctival bee sting with retention of the stinger 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. This review has allowed an evaluation of the dif-ferent clinical presentations and complications of ocular bee\n\n【44】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5.

The majority of previously pub-lished cases involved corneal bee stings (51 cases)， and there were five cases of conjunctival bee stings (9%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-6\\]</u>. Six pub-lications described cases of periocular bee stings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u> and palpebral bee stings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10-13\\]</u>， and in two publications， ocular complications were described that included blepharochalasis and optic neuropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>.\n\n【50】Four previously published reports described allergic and inflam-matory complications associated with the release of the com-ponents of bee venom， including the polypeptides melittin and apamin， and the enzymes hyaluronidase and phospholipase A2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14-17\\]</u>.

In more than 70% of previous publications， there was conjunctival hyperemia associated with conjunctival edema on initial examination， which indi-cated a local inflammatory reaction due to the components of bee venom 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. In 60% of cases， there was a visible cor-neal stromal inflammation around the bee sting site， and in40% of cases， there was associated edema of the eyelid. There were five main complications identified that had an impact on vision， including inflammation of the anterior chamber， cata-racts， ocular pressure abnormalities， cellular alterations of the corneal endothelium， and optic neuropathies. Tables 2 and 3list the complications and the treatments used in either con-junctival or corneal bee stings.\n\n【53】There is controversy regarding the removal of the bee stinger in the management of ocular been stings， as early complications have been highlighted following removal. Manipulation of the stinger retained in the cornea can cause severe inflammatory reactions from the release of toxins， causing new complications通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25-28\\]</u>， or by preventing complete healing of the lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. The surgical removal of the stinger may be complicated and can result in additional corneal scarring after removal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. These complications can cause reduced visual acuity by altering the transparency of the cornea， depending on the initial location of the stinger， which may be either central or paracentral 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Retention of the bee stinger combined with appropriate treat-ment has been described by some authors where the distal por-tion of the stinger is left in place， especially when local compli-cations or inflammation were present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21，24，25，31\\]</u>.\n\n【54】A previously published case described by Gilboa et al. showed that a stinger left in place for many years could be inert and not cause any complication， with a description of a stinger retained\n\n【55】Table 3.

Among the eight cases from the literature where stingers were left in place 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20，24-26，32，33\\]</u>， four of the cases had complications of ocular inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20，24，32\\]</u>，and three cases had cataracts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20，33\\]</u>. In one case， it was not possible to determine whether increased inflammation was due to the at-tempted withdrawal of the stinger or persistence of a portion of the stinger in a patient without other types of treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>.\n\n【58】Some authors have recommended the withdrawal of the bee stinger 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，32-35\\]</u>. However， on review of previously published studies， treatment included the withdrawal of the stinger and\n\n【59】topical treatment with steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs com-bined with topical and systemic antibiotics， and some au-thors have described surgical removal techniques. For example， Chauhan et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u> recommended the use of an ophthalmic endo-illuminator during the procedure. A detailed examination is al-ways necessary before removal of the bee stinger， including eye-lid eversion， especially when the stinger is not found at the site of the lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>. The introduction of systemic treatment with corticosteroids is also widely recommended and seems to prevent complications or increase their resolution 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，13，32，34，37-39\\]</u>.On review of the previously reported cases， there were 43 stinger removals， 17 cases of clinical exacerbation following the with-drawal of the stinger (approximately 40% of cases)， with only one patient who did not follow the prescribed postoperative med-ical instructions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>. Analysis of the 17 cases that had worse symptoms following the withdrawal of the stinger， 59% of the cases did not receive systemic corticosteroid treatment .\n\n【60】Gudiseva et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u> described the largest number of previ-ously reported cases of ocular bee stings， in which six out of11 patients， including five patients treated with systemic cor-ticosteroids， did not have any symptoms following the with-drawal of the bee stinger. However， five patients who only received topical treatment developed complications， includ-ing cataracts， increased intraocular pressure， and uveitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. These findings support the use of combined systemic and topical treatment， rather than the use of topical treatment alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. In some reports， surgical treatment was sometimes required during follow-up， including the use of phacoemulsi-fication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41，42\\]</u>， external trabeculectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24，37\\]</u>， penetrating keratoplasty 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，23，37，41\\]</u>， or Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[43\\]</u>. Several case reports showed a favorable outcome following washing of the ante-rior chamber with balanced salt solution (BSS) combined with the surgical removal of the stinger 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17，34，38，41，44\\]</u>.\n\n【61】Following further analysis of the published cases of conjunc-tival bee stings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-6\\]</u>， four of these five cases did not show stinger retention， as described in the present case. The only previously published case that described a conjunctival lesion with persistent stinger did not describe the method of removal of the bee stinger 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. However， this previous case report was similar to the present case， with an isolated lesion without as-sociated deep ocular inflammation， treated with topical eye drops， and with a good short-term outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In this case， slit lamp removal and treatment with topical antibiotic eye drops and corticosteroids showed satisfactory results on patient fol-low-up. In the five previously published cases of conjunctival bee stings， complications were described following conjunc-tival suturing， in two out of five cases， which should encour-age vigilant follow-up of these patients. In one of these two cases， optic neuropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> was described only a few hours after the bee sting. In the second case， the conjunctival lesion\n\n【62】was complicated by extensive uveitis with iris atrophy， pupil-lary siderosis， and secondary cataract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【63】Additional examinations in cases of ocular bee sting include the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the anterior cham-ber 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32，33\\]</u>， which makes it possible to identify and time the sur-gical removal of the bee stinger by determining the extent of the lesion and its localization. OCT can also be useful postoperatively in evaluating the total resection of the stinger. The use of confo-cal microscopy can make it possible to visualize the presence of corneal residues， which may be responsible for the persistence of local inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31，45\\]</u>. Finally， the use of specular micros-copy of the corneal endothelium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22，35，46，47\\]</u>appears to be an important examination method for use in patient follow-up for patients who have alterations ofthe corneal endothelium， in par-ticular for the evaluation of endothelial cell loss， which can be important in the context of corneal bee stings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22，24，28，35，38\\]</u>.\n\n【64】From the review of the literature and the cumulative experi-ence from previously reported cases of ocular bee stings， some lessons can be learned regarding the optimal initial manage-ment. The affected eye can be rinsed with a sterile normal sa-line solution and treated with topical anti-inflammatory eye drops and antibiotics. An ophthalmological evaluation is nec-essary to correctly visualize the lesion under a slit lamp and remove the stinger， if it is accessible. If the stinger is inserted too deeply， surgical intervention may be necessary to extract it. Also， careful follow-up is required to re-evaluate the affected eye and to ensure that healing has occurred and that there are no complications that may impair vision in the patient with a previous ocular bee sting， including conjunctival bee sting.\n\n【65】Conclusions\n\n【66】Ocular bee sting injuries are rare but can have serious compli-cations that include cataracts， uveitis， raised intraocular pres-sure， and optic neuropathies. A thorough examination of the eye is required to identify and remove the bee sting and may require the use of additional methods of examination， includ-ing confocal microscopy， optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the anterior chamber， and specular microscopy of the cor-neal endothelium. Although there are no treatment guide-lines， management includes the withdrawal of the stinger and the use of topical anti-inflammatory eye drops and antibiot-ics combined with systemic corticosteroid treatment. Careful and frequent follow-up is required to ensure that there are no complications in the first few weeks following initial treat-ment and to ensure that vision in the affected eye is preserved.\n\n【67】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of interest</u>\n\n【68】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

Metastatic SCC from HS typically invo lves the axial skeleton or abdominopelvic viscera. Metastatic disease to the lungs is a rare phenomenon with only three reported cases of lung parenchyma. We present a biopsy proven case of metastatic SCC to the pleura from gluteal HS.\n\n【26】Case Report：\n\n【27】A 46-year-old male with a history of recently diagnosed Marjolin ulcer secondary to gluteal HS was trans-ferred to our intensive care unit for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to recurrent pleural effu-sion. On examination， patient was febrile (38.3℃)， normotensive (blood pressure 98/65 mm Hg)， tachycardic(116 beats/minute) and tachypneic (40 breaths/minute) with oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. He was in moderate distress requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Chest examination revealed decreased breath sounds bilaterally and skin examination was significant for 18 cm wide sacral lesion. CT tho-rax showed bilateral pleural effusions， pleural thickening， and scattered nodular densities within both lungs concerning for metastatic disease. Thoracentesis showed lymphocyte predominant exudate with negative cy-tology for malignant cells. A video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) illustrated thickened pleural rind with histopathology and positive p40 stain consistent with invasive well-to-moderately differentiated keratinizing SCC.\n\n【28】Conclusions： SCC arising from HS is rare and metastatic disease to the pleura has not been reported previously.

We report what ap-pears to be the first biopsy-proven metastatic SCC of the skin with metastases to the pleura in a patient with HS.\n\n【33】Case Report\n\n【34】A 46-year-old overweight Hispanic male with a previous histo-ry of hypertension， 5-pack per year history of tobacco smoking and a 33-year history of Hurley type three gluteal HS was trans-ferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for acute hy-poxemic respiratory failure secondary to recurrent pleural effu-sion. Six weeks prior， he was diagnosed with perianal SCC with positive inguinal lymph node biopsy. At the time， CT thorax did not reveal any intrathoracic abnormalities . On presen-tation to the MICU， he was febrile (38.3℃)， normotensive (BP98/65 mm Hg)，tachycardic (116 beats/minute) and tachypne-ic (40 breaths/minute) with a peripheral capillary oxygen sat-uration of 93% on room air. He was in moderate distress， un-able to speak in full sentences and was placed on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). Due to worsening tachy-pnea and fatigue， patient underwent endotracheal intubation and was placed on mechanical ventilation. Chest examination revealed decreased breath sounds bilaterally and decreased air movement. Skin examination was significant for 18 cm wide sacral lesion with ulcerative borders and scant mucopurulent discharge. No axillary or cervical lymphadenopathy could be palpated. Laboratory studies showed leukocytosis (WBC count23.8x10/pL， 90% neutrophils)， anemia (Hgb 7.9 g/dl)， and thrombocytosis (platelet count 594×10/pL). He was hypercal-cemic (ionized calcium 1.63 mmol/L) with an elevated parathy-roid hormone related peptide (35 pg/pL). Chest x-ray revealed a near complete opacification of right hemithorax. CT scan of the thorax revealed bilateral pleural effusion with right side greater than left， pleural thickening and evidence of scattered nodular densities within both lungs concerning for metastatic disease. Thoracentesis yielded 1，500 mL of serosanguinous fluid that was a lymphocyte predominant exudate with cyto-logical evaluation negative for malignant cells. Repeat CT scan after thoracentesis showed significant pleural thickening and persistent nodular parenchymal disease . Second set of pleural fluid studies were consistent with lymphocyte pre-dominant exudative pleural effusion but remained negative for malignant cells. A video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)\n\n【35】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

Biopsy of the pleural rind was performed and was positive for carcinoma on frozen section. Due to poor pleu-ral compliance from invasive carcinoma and recurrent pleural effusion， patient had a persistent pneumothorax ex vacuo re-quiring chest tube and PleurXcatheter placement.\n\n【41】Initial histopathological examination of sacral lesion biopsy showed nests of polygonal cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and keratin pearls . Similar pathological findings were ob-served in the pleural rind biopsy . Additionally，both the sacral lesion and the pleural rind stained positive for im-munoperoxidase stain p40 . Diagnosis of metastat-ic SCC of the pleura was favored due to rapid development of parenchymal and pleural disease and shared pathological characteristics between the two lesions.\n\n【42】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 6. Low power (10x) view of pleural rind with immunoperoxidase p40 stain specific for SCC.</u>\n\n【43】Given the patient's declining status and extensive disease bur-den， the decision was made by the family to pursue comfort measures and the patient was palliatively extubated. He sub-sequently passed away shortly thereafter.\n\n【44】Discussion\n\n【45】Hidradenitis suppurativa is a common disorder first described by a French physician Aristide Verneuil in 1854 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. HS can oc-cur in up to 4.1% of the population and is known to predomi-nantly affect women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The pathogenesis is poorly understood but involves follicular hyperkeratosis， lymphocytic inflamma-tion， and sinus tract formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，6\\]</u>. Despite HS being more likely to develop in women， transformation to cancer occurs more commonly in men 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【46】Development of ScC， also known as Marjolin ulcer， is a rare complication of HS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Malignant transformation of HS into SCC occurs in about 4.6% of the patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Chronic inflamma-tion is a major factor associated with this transformation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. These ulcerating lesions can also arise from chronic osteomy-elitis， burns， diabetic foot ulcers， or trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Marjolin ul-cers resulting from chronic inflammation have a much higher rate of developing metastases compared to de novo SCC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【47】The most common sites for development of SCC are the peri-neal， perianal， and gluteal skin， paralleling the most common areas for HS to affect men 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Although distant metastasis is generally rare in SCC secondary to HS， metastatic sites report-ed in the literature include the axial skeleton， abdominopel-vic viscera， peritoneum， vulva， and lung parenchyma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，4，8\\]</u>. In our patient， the metastatic disease was to the pleura. To the best of our knowledge， this is the first reported case of biopsy proven pleural SCC metastasis secondary to Marjolin ulcer arising from HS.\n\n【48】Diagnosis of SCC is confirmed by histopathological findings of polygonal cells， keratin pearls， and hyperchromatic nuclei 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The degree of differentiation is determined by the resem-blance of cancer cells to native squamous cells present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Additionally utilization of immunoperoxidase stain such as p40is shown to be more specific for SCC compared to tradition-al p63 stain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，11\\]</u> and can bolster the diagnosis. Treatment of SCC in HS involves aggressive wide en-bloc surgical exci-sion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Despite this， patients can develop metastatic disease and treatment usually becomes palliative in nature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In our patient， wide local excision of his sacro-gluteal SCC occurred too late as the patient already had metastatic disease to his inguinal lymph nodes prior to surgery.\n\n【49】The time frame from diagnosis of Marjolin ulcer to metastatic disease to the lung is not well established. The development of metastatic lung disease portends a poor prognosis with overall survival being two to three months from diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. High index of suspicion for malignancy should be maintained for HS in extra-axillary sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Pulmonary symptoms or new radiological findings should prompt an aggressive investiga-tion to rule out metastatic disease. Negative pleural fluid cy-tology for malignancy does not exclude invasive disease， as in our patient， and diagnosis can be made with pleural biopsy.\n\n【50】References：\n\n【51】1\\.

METHODS： The present study was carried out retrospectively between March 2015 and September 2016. Eighty diabetic foot infection attacks of 68 patients with foot lesions at the grade of≥ PEDIS 3 and≥ WAGNER 2 were included in the present study. Demographic data of the patients， type of diabetes， staging of a diabetic foot according to PEDIS and Wagner classification， the treatments they have received， laboratory parameters， culture results， and treatment outcome have all been recorded to prepared forms. Deep tissue culture was obtained from all patients and sampling was carried out. The treatment they received and prognoses were evaluated. RESULTS： In samples obtained from 80 attacks included in the study， 30 (%53，6) GRAM 通用删除7(英):<u>(-)</u> bacteria 24(%42，9) GRAM(+) bacteria，2 (%3.5) Candida spp， overall 56 (%70) bacteria were isolated. The most commonly growing bacteria were； S.aureus(n=16，%28.6)，Proteus spp(n=9，%16) and E.coli (n=6，%10). In 7 (%91.25) attacks， surgical treatment was administered apart from antibiotic treatment， and the rate of amputation was found to be %33.75. The rate of recovery was found to be higher in patients whose antibiotic treatment remained unchanged from the onset than that found in patients whose treatment was changed. In 70% of diabetic foot infection attacks evaluated in the present study growth was detected， and most of the agents were established to be GRAM negative bacteria. CONCLUSION： Antimicrobial treatment providing cover against probable microbial agent increases the probability of recovery. Therefore， determination of active spectrums according to regions and the choice of suitable antibiothreapy will render prognosis better.\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】One of the most important complications of diabetes is diabetic foot infection (DFI). In the aetiology of DFIs， infections also play a part in addition to peripheric angiopathy and neuropathy.\n\n【7】Copyright @ 2019 by the Bulgarian Association of Young Surgeons\n\n【8】DOI：10.5455/JMRCR.Diabetic-foot-infection22648\n\n【9】First Received： January 21，2019\n\n【10】Accepted： February 06， 2019\n\n【11】Associate Editor： Ivan Inkov (BG)\n\n【12】Reviewer： Sharan Badiger (IN)1Afyon Saglik Bilimleri University， Zafer Saglik Kulliyesi； Dortyol Mah. 2078 Sok. No：3AFYONKARAHISAR/TURKEY\n\n【13】Telephone： 00905303646795\n\n【14】Moreover， the development of infection is closely associated with the frequency of extremity amputations in patients with di-abetes. Over half of foot amputations， which are not associated with trauma， occur in diabetic patients. DFIs are an essential economic and social public health issue not only for being a sig-nificant health problem threatening lower extremities and lives of patients but also for leading to hospitalisations of patients for an extended period. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【15】DFI requires a multidisciplinary approach. Hence， coordi-nated action of plastic surgery， orthopaedics， endocrinology， radiology， microbiology and infectious diseases departments is necessary for treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. One of the most critical parameters of infection is the elimination of infections. Microbiological diag-nosis is critical for proper infection treatment and the prevention of unnecessary antibiotic use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【16】The present study aimed to determine the demographic char-\n\n|  | Number of patients (n)  | Percentage (%)  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Sex  |  |  |\n| Female  | 23  | 33.8  |\n| Male  | 45  | 66.2  |\n| Age  |  |  |\n| 65 age>  | 30  | 44.1  |\n| 65 age ≤  | 38  | 55.9  |\n| Type of Diabetes  |  |  |\n| lype 1  | 2  | 2.9  |\n| lype 2  | 66  | 97.1  |\n| Antidiabetic treatment  |  |  |\n| Insulin  | 28  | 41.2  |\n| Oral Antidiabetic Drug (OAD)  | 11  | 16.2  |\n| Insulin + OAD  | 29  | 42.6  |\n\n【18】acteristics of patients followed with the diagnosis of DFI and the distribution of microbial agents using an accurate sampling of cultures and to evaluate the suitability of empiric antibiotics administered.\n\n【19】Material and Method\n\n【20】The present study was carried out retrospectively between the dates of March 2015-September 2016 after local ethics committee approval. All patients， included in the study， were informed about the aim and method of the study. The signed consent form was obtained from all individuals participating in the study. Pa-tients with DFI， who were followed in Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology clinic were included in the present study. Patients whose foot lesion was class 3 according to PEDIS classification and > class to 2 according to Wagner classifica-tion were included in the study. In patients who referred with more than one DFI attack at different times，each DFI attack was evaluated separately. A thorough history and family history was obtained from all patients. All underwent systemic exam-ination and findings were recorded. Demographic data of the patients， clinical examination findings of foot lesions( purulent drainage， erythema， fluctuation， heat increase， pain or tender-ness， induration， spread to deep tissues and bone)，laboratory findings (hematological and biochemical blood examinations， CRP and sedimentation)， results of imaging studies and findings of foot lesions according to classification techniques employed in the present study were recorded.\n\n【21】In the patients included in the study to determine DFI agents， the sample for tissue culture was obtained by punch biopsy nee-dle from wound bed of infected lesions after debridement，and in closed lesions that did not require debridement， the culture was sampled by needle aspiration. Clinical samples from pa-tients were inoculated into media with suitable transportation for anaerobe and aerobe cultures and sent to the microbiology laboratory.\n\n【22】Previous antibiotic treatment received by the patients were recorded at first evaluation. Ampiric antibiotic treatment initi-ated after sampling was recorded and the patients were followed up for response to treatment via clinical and laboratory param-eters . When there was no response to treatment， and empiric treatment did not cover the agents isolated in the culture， antibi-otic treatment regimen was replaced with another one. Surgical interventions carried out in patients who did not respond to treatment only with antibiotics and wound care were evaluated as well. All medical and surgical interventions were evaluated， and prognoses were determined.\n\n【23】Statistical Analysis\n\n【24】For the analysis of findings， IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0 program was used. Whether the data were distributed normally was evaluated with Shapiro-Wilk test. In the comparison of normally distributed data between groups， Student-t-test and the com-parison of data not normally distributed， the Mann-Whitney U test was utilized. In the comparison of categorical data， Chi-square analysis was used. In descriptive statistics， percentage， mean， standard deviation， median， minimum and maximum values were used. P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n【25】Results\n\n【26】Eighty DFI attacks identified in 68 patients with DFI were in-cluded in the present study. Forty-five patients were male(%66.2) while 23 were (%33.8) female. Mean age was 61.59±11.93. The number of patients with Type 1 DM was 2 (%2.9)， while that of patients with Type 2 DM was 66 (%97.1) Mean duration of diabetes was found to be 16.7±8 years. Demographic data of the patients are demonstrated in Table 1.\n\n【27】The most common localization of 80 DAI attacks was 35fingers (%43.75)with ulcers localized in this region. Other locali-sations are respectively 14 metatarsal(17.5%)， 11 heel(13.75%)，11foot ridge(13.75%)，9 foot base(11.25%). The distribution of DFI attacks included in the study according to Wagner and PEDIS classification is demonstrated in Figure I.\n\n【28】Of 80 cultures obtained from 80 DFI attacks of 65 patients，73 (%91.2) was tissue culture and 7 (%8.8) abscess aspiration\n\n【29】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2： Prognosis in DFI attacks.</u>\n\n【30】Table 2 Distribution of isolated agents.\n\n|  | n  | %  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| GRAM positive agents  |  |  |\n| S.aureus (MSSA)  | 13  | 23.2  |\n| Enterococcus spp.  | 5  | 8.9  |\n| Streptococcus spp.  | 3  | 5.4  |\n| MRSA  | 3  | 5.4  |\n| Overall  | 24  | 42.9  |\n| GRAM negative agents  |  |  |\n| Proteus sPP·  | 9  | 16  |\n| E.coli  | 6  | 10.7  |\n| Klebsiella spp.  | 5  | 8.9  |\n| Morganella morganii  | 4  | 7.1  |\n| Acinetobacter spp.  | 3  | 5.4  |\n| GSBL(+)E.coli  | 2  | 3.6  |\n| Paeruginosa  | 1  | 1.8  |\n| Overall  | 30  | 53.6  |\n| Candida spp.  | 2  | 3.5  |\n| Overall  | 56  | 100  |\n\n【32】culture. No microorganism was isolated in 24 out of 80(%30) cul-tures. Fifty-six microbial agents were isolated from remaining 56(%70) cultures. There was no polymicrobial growth. Anaerobic microorganism growth occurred in none of the samples. The distribution of isolated microorganisms was shown in Table II. Most commonly isolated microorganisms were S.aureus，Proteus spp， and E.coli. In 47 of 80 evaluated attacks (%58.7)， patients were on antibiotics before the presentation， while in 33 (%41.3)， there was no previous history of antibiotic use. Of antibiotic treatment regimes， 44 was monotherapy and three combined antibiotic treatment. Antibiotics used were determined to be in decreasing order of frequency amoxicillin-clavulanic acid， cephalosporin， moxifloxacin， ciprofloxacin， fusidic acid and ri-fampicin. While there was the previous history of antibiotic use in 33.3% of attacks in which there was GRAM positive agent growth， such history was present in 66.6% of attacks with GRAM negative agent growth， with a statistically significant difference(p=0.009).\n\n【33】In all DFI attacks evaluated in the present study， after mi-crobiological sampling was carried out， empiric antibiotic treat-ment was commenced. Options preferred in ampiric treatment were in decreasing order of frequency ampicillin-sulbactam， moxifloxacin， ertapenem， daptomycin， tigecycline， cefazolin， ciprofloxacin， piperacillin-tazobactam， meropenem， cefepime and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. In 70 attacks monotherapy and in 10 attacks combined treatment was commenced. It was established in the follow up treatment that in 48 attacks (%60)， treatment continued with empiric treatment used at onset， in17 (%21.25)， treatment was altered according to the growth re-sults in the sample and 14 (%17.5)， treatment was changed in spite of the absence of growth in the culture， as there was no clinical response to treatment. In one case (%1.25) Candida spp. Isolated in the culture was not considered as a causative agent clinically and treatment was changed， taking clinical response into consideration.\n\n【34】In the evaluation of empiric antibiotic regimes administered in DAI attacks with growth in their cultures， it was established that in 22 of 56 (39.2%) cases with growth in their cultures， em-piric treatment was continued with the present antibiotic， while in 34(%39.2)， treatment was changed according to culture re-sults.\n\n【35】When all Wagner stages were evaluated， of 32 DFI attacks in which treatment was changed， complete improvement or com-plete infection control was achieved in 36 (75%). Of 48 attacks whose treatment was continued with original empiric treatment， complete improvement or infection control was achieved in 36(%75)(p=0.02).\n\n【36】It was established that in 3 of 80 attacks (%3.75) patients re-fused treatment. In 42 out of remaining 77 DFI attacks，(%52，5)， the improvement was observed with medical or surgical treat-ments. In 32 (%40) attacks， present infection picture partly re-solved， but the diabetic wound did not close， and the patient was followed with foot care. Mortality occurred in 3 of 80 attacks(%3，75). Mortality occurred due to pulmonary embolism during admission to hospital in one patient and complications associ-ated with DFI in two patients. The prognoses of 80 patients followed in the present study are displayed in Figure Ⅱ.\n\n【37】Discussion\n\n【38】Diabetic foot infection is a significant health problem requiring a multidisciplinary approach. In patients with whom DFI devel-oped， rapid control of infection and prevention of amputations\n\n【39】secondary to DFI and of deaths associated with sepsis and septic shock are most important targets. To reach these targets， rapid intervention to DFIs， early and accurate debridement and proper antibiotic treatment are of great significance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，14\\]</u>.\n\n【40】It is known that DFI’s occur more commonly in male patients and those over the age of 40 and that the prevalence increases with advancing age通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In a multicenter study carried out in Turkey with 455 patients， by Saltoglu et al.， it was established that the male/female ratio was 2.1 and the mean age of patients was 61 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Consistent with their results， the male/female ratio was found to be 1.95 and mean age 61.5 in the present study.\n\n【41】In the present study it was established that DFIs are localized most commonly in toes. In the literature， similarly， it has been reported that diabetic foot ulcers occur most commonly in the front part of the foot (70-90%) to be followed by the heel and mid part of the foot. The reason for this localization is the foot region， which is first influenced by peripheral neuropathy and exposed to trauma most commonly6\\].\n\n【42】The distribution of DFI attacks evaluated in the present study according to Wagner classification was as follows： Wagner 2%16.2； Wagner 3 %30， Wagner 4%47.5 and Wagner 5 %6.3， in-dicating that the rate of attacks classified as Wagner 3 or over was 83.7%. As to PEDIS classification， the distribution of our study group was PEDIS 3 %92.5 and PEDIS 5 %7.5. When these distributions are evaluated， it can be seen that the majority of our cases consists of those with severe infection. In a study， the rate of patients at Wagner stage 3 or over was found to be 70%，which is quite lower than our results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The high rate of patients at Wagner stage ≥ 3 in the present study may be attributed to the low sociocultural level of patient population， and hence to the delay in presentation to hospital for diabetic foot injuries.\n\n【43】Microorganisms which are agents of DFI are quite variable. In the literature， DFI's are evaluated as having polymicrobial aetiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The distribution of microbial agents varies accord-ing to the severity of underlying disease， characteristics of the hospital and regional variations between countries. The most commonly detected agents are GRAM-positive aerobes such as S. aureus， and streptococcus and Gram-negative microorganisms belonging to Enterobacteriaceae family. In a study conducted by Ertugrul et al. in 2017， the results of the studies performed between 2000-2014 in Turkey has been investigated， and the change in the distribution of microorganisms leading to DFI was evaluated with five year periods， and %45.8 of the agents were found to be GRAM-positive， %53.7 GRAM-negative and%0.05 Candida spp. The most commonly isolated organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (%22.8)， Pseudomonas aeruginosa(%16.7) and Escherichia coli (%12.9). Overall 28 studies were evaluated and the increase in GRAM negative agents and a de-crease in GRAM negative agents in five year periods was found to be significant. Also， decrease in MRSA rate within the last five years was also found to be substantial. Another observation was that the prevalence of isolation of P. aeruginosa agents decreased over the years \\[9J. Unlike the data in the present study， GRAM negative organisms account for 53.6% of isolated agents. Also， P. Aeruginosa was found to be isolated only the rate of %1.8，and our findings are discordant with those of Ertugrul et al. Given our results， care should be taken to cover GRAM negative bac-teria when administering empiric antibiotic treatment， and as suggested in the literature， anti-pseudomonal spectrum should be chosen only in risky conditions.\n\n【44】In the present study， microbiological sampling was carried out in all 80 DFI attacks we evaluated. Seventy-three of the sam-\n\n【45】ples (%91.2) was tissue culture and 7(%8.8) abscess aspiration culture. In 24 out of 80 (30%)cultures obtained， no agent could be isolated. In a study by Mutluoglu et al， no agent was isolated in 20 of 89 patients (22.4%) with deep tissue culture， which is compatible with our results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【46】The microbial agent was isolated in 70% of the samples ob-tained in the present study. The distribution of overall 56 agents isolated was similar to that in the study of Saltoglu et al.， and24(%42.9) were found to be GRAM-positive bacteria， 30 (%53.6) GRAM-negative bacteria and 2 (%3，5) fungi.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The most com-monly growing three microorganisms among all isolated agents were； S.aureus (n=16，%28.6)，Proteus spp (n=9，%16) and E.coli(n=6，%10.7). In the literature， among GRAM positive bacteria playing a part in the aetiology of DFI， Proteus species are among the least common ones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，12\\]</u>. However， in a study performed in Brazil， similar to our results， the most commonly isolated GRAM negative agent in DFI has been reported to Proteus通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>， which is among the enteric bacteria， is commonly found in wa-ter， soil and stool and can be an agent in wound infections by colonizing open wounds. These bacteria， which can grow easily in moist environments， possess the characteristics of produc-ing inducible beta-lactamase and GSBL： Recently， it has been reported that the prevalence of GSBL positive Proteus has in-creased通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Therefore， when initiating antibiotic treatment in DFIs， it should be kept in mind that resistant Proteus species can be common agents. S. aureus isolates methicillin-resistant rates were evaluated in various studies and the study of Ertugrul et al.， the rate of MRSA among GRAM positive bacteria was found to be %10.3， and in the study of Saltoglu et al， this rate was %11.9and in the present study %12.5通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，9\\]</u>. In view of our results， it was concluded that empiric antibiotic treatment does not have to cover MRSA strains as the rate of isolation of MRSA was only12.5% and that the addition of drugs protecting cover against DVe these microorganisms would be indicated only if high-risk fac-tors present for MRSA as defined in the literature， if the lesion is > stage 4 according to Wagner classification and if MRSA is isolated in the culture.\n\n【47】In the studies especially from our country investigating ac-tive agents in DFI's，Pseudomonas has been reported to be the leading agent among GRAM negative bacteria. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，12\\]</u>. However， in the present study， Pseudomonas accounted for only one of the isolated GRAM negative agents. When culture results obtained with swab method are compared with those obtained with deep tissue culture， it can be seen that the former method remains inadequate in establishing the true rate of GRAM-negative mi-croorganisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. In the present study， all cultures were ob-tained from deep tissue， which may be associated with low rates of Pseudomonas. Nevertheless， the likelihood of the changes in the spectrum of agents in patients with DFI should be taken into account， and exciting results we obtained should serve as a guide for future studies.\n\n【48】In DFI， when necrotic wounds coursing with gangrene， anaer-obes may turn out to be agents通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In spite of many studies carried out on DFI within the last two decades， the actual preva-lence of anaerobic pathogens in DFI remains uncertain. In DFI， the growth of microbial agent in the culture obtained depends upon many parameters such as the method of obtaining a cul-ture， type of sample， transfer method of sample to microbiology laboratory and method and methods used in the laboratory. In the present study， no anaerobic agent was isolated， and it was thought that this might be associated with the difficulties men-tioned above in isolation.\n\n【49】The probability of the isolation of GRAM-negative agents is higher in patients who have used extended spectrum antibiotics previously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Similarly， in the present study， in 33.3% of DFI attacks with GRAM positive agent growth， there was a history of previous antibiotic use， while antibiotic use history was present in 66.6% of attacks with GRAM negative agent growth The difference between them was found to be statistically significant (p=0.009).The results obtained in the present study support the idea that previous history of antibiotic use increases the probability of GRAM-negative agents in DFI's.\n\n【50】In antibiotic selection at the onset of DFIs， care should be taken to cover commonly encountered microorganisms and severity of infection， and in patients hospitalized previously， local sensitivity results of the hospital (if present) should be taken into consideration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. In the present study， in DFI at-tacks， ampiric antibiotic treatment was instituted immediately after microbiological sampling. In the evaluation of empirical treatments， it was seen that improvement was observed in 34 of48 patients (70.8%) who continued ampiric treatment unchanged， while improvement occurred in 19 of 32(59%) patients whose treatment regime was replaced with another(p=0.02). This result indicates the importance of suitable empiric antibiotic treatment in the prognosis of the patient. The suitability of the antibiotic agent chosen at the onset of treatment to the probable agent significantly increases the likelihood of recovery.\n\n【51】In the approach to DFI’s， where antibiotic treatment and wound care are present， early surgical intervention in infected ulcer is significant. Surgical treatments for these patients in-clude a wide range of simple debridement of soft tissues，rang-ing from significant amputation. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> In our study， the rate of recovery was significantly higher in patients who underwent surgical treatment with concomitant antibiotic therapy. (Tablo EKLENEBILIR). When we look at the studies conducted in our country， it was reported that the rate of amputation was 37%in the follow-up of 574 patients who applied between 1998 and2008 in the study of Yesil et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Again in our country， Dur-gun and friends in their study of patients with DAI amputation rate was 33.3% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. In our study， the rate of amputation was33.75% by the literature.\n\n【52】In conclusion； in the follow-up patients at an advanced age and of the male sex， it is essential to inform patients about DFI that may involve toes and to warn patients before lesion devel-opment so that the development of DFI can be prevented. In patients who refer after the development of DFI， especially if the stage of the wound is advanced， GRAM negative agents should be taken into account in empiric treatment， and due to the varying spectrum of agents， the repetition of similar studies periodically is of great significance.\n\n【53】Competing Interests\n\n【54】The authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n\n【55】Funding\n\n【56】This study supported from Afyon Kocatepe University Scien-tific Research Coordination Unit Project No： 14.TUS.11 with11.355.12 TL grand fund.\n\n【57】通用结尾删除-1:<u>References</u>\n\n【58】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

Right-sided endocarditis is in itself rare， with some studies reporting an incidence of 5-10%. The majority of these cases involve the tricuspid valve， and isolated pulmonary valve endocarditis(PVE) is an extremely rare entity affecting less than 2% of patients with infective endocarditis. Identification and early management are crucial to prevent long-term complications and reduce mortality.\n\n【28】Case Report：\n\n【29】We present a patient with a history of essential hypertension and no underlying valvular disease， who under-went dental cleaning and subsequently developed low-grade fever，myalgia， and malaise. This occurred during the flu season， and was initially diagnosed and treated as flu， without any improvement. The patient was later found to be bacteremic with S. mitis， with no identifiable source， and a normal transthoracic echocardiogram(TTE). He was later hospitalized， had a transesophageal echocardiogram， and was found to have a large pul-monic valve vegetation.\n\n【30】Conclusions： This case presents an interesting and rare finding of endocarditis， isolated to the pulmonic valve， in an other-wise healthy individual with no predisposing risk factors. The lack of peripheral stigmata， as well as an unre-markable initial outpatient TTE， made the diagnosis more difficult. It should also be noted that current guide-lines do not specifically address right-sided endocarditis， and do not specify the role of surgical intervention.\n\n【31】MeSH Keywords： Endocarditis·Endocarditis， Bacterial·Pulmonary Valve\n\n【32】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/913041v\n\n【33】Infective endocarditis (IE)， although rare， has a high mortality rate， even with appropriate antibiotic therapy and surgical in-tervention. Isolated pulmonic valve endocarditis (PVE) is ex-tremely rare， affecting less than 2% of patients with IE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Early symptoms of IE can be initially misdiagnosed as a viral illness， particularly during the flu season， which can result in delayed intervention and an increased rate of complications. This case is an example of the importance of avoiding the cog-nitive bias of anchoring when a clinical history suggests an al-ternate， potentially fatal， diagnosis. It also adds to the short list of isolated PVE cases with no predisposing risk factors.\n\n【34】Case report\n\n【35】A 47-year-old man presented to the emergency department(ED) at another hospital， in the winter， with complaints of fe-vers， malaise， chills， and joint and neck pain of 3-week dura-tion. His medical history included hypertension. The patient had professional dental cleaning performed 2 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms. These symptoms were initially attrib-uted to flu and he was subsequently discharged with a course of oseltamivir， but his symptoms failed to resolve. Blood cul-tures obtained during that ED visit yielded Streptococcus mitis. Given his symptoms and positive blood cultures， his primary care physician ordered a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE)， which was unremarkable. He was then referred to our hospital due to suspicion of endocarditis.\n\n【36】The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs on presentation to our hospital. Physical examination was unremarkable for stigmata of endocarditis. Lab data revealed ESR 48 mm/hr (nor-mal 0-22 mm/hr) and CRP 10.796 (normal<3 mg/L). Complete blood count and metabolic panel were normal. Initial chest ra-diograph and urinalysis were negative. Vancomycin and cef-triaxone were initiated in the emergency department. S. mitis was again isolated from blood cultures. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed because of persis-tent bacteremia. Repeat TTE and TEE revealed a large highly mobile pulmonic valve vegetation (17x6 mm)， with mild pul-monic regurgitation， without involvement of any other heart valve . The cardiothoracic surgery service did not rec-ommend surgical intervention.\n\n【37】The blood culture isolate was sensitive to ceftriaxone； thus， vancomycin was discontinued. The infectious disease consul-tant recommended a 6-week course of ceftriaxone. The pa-tient had persistent fevers and the acute onset of left-sided chest pain 1 week after admission. A repeat TTE revealed ade-crease in the size of the vegetation. Because of persistent fe-ver in the setting of negative blood cultures， and the decrease\n\n【38】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1. Echocardiogram with arrow (red) demonstrating bulky mobile pulmonic valve vegetation.</u>\n\n【39】in the size of the vegetation， partial embolization of the vege-tation was considered. 67A gallium scan was performed， which demonstrated increased uptake in the posterior left lower lobe of the lung. Persistent fever was attributed to septic microem-bolization to the lung. The antibiotic regimen was expanded to include gentamicin 100 mg every 8 h， and thereafter fevers subsided and the patient remained hemodynamically stable. Antibiotics were continued on an outpatient basis with medi-cations administered via a peripherally-inserted central cath-eter. The regimen included gentamicin 100 mg every 8 h for2 weeks and ceftriaxone 2 g every 12 h for 6 weeks. A repeat TEE 1 month later showed continued resolution of vegetations.\n\n【40】Discussion\n\n【41】Infective endocarditis (IE) has a high mortality rate， despite treatment with appropriate antibiotic therapy and surgical intervention. IE has an in-hospital mortality rate of 15-20%， and a 1-year mortality rate approaching 40%. The overall in-cidence of IE is 3-10 per 100 000 patient-years， with a higher prevalence in older patients. Right-sided endocarditis is less common than left-sided involvement，and accounts for 5-10%of IE cases， most of these cases involve the tricuspid valve. Isolated pulmonic valve endocarditis (PVE) affects less than2% of patients with IE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The literature review published by Chowdhury et al. estimated that 70 cases of isolated PVE were reported between 1979 and 2013 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Predisposing factors for PVE include intravenous drug abuse， alcoholism， sepsis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， im-munosuppression， and catheter-related infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Up to28% of cases of PVE have no identified predisposing factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【42】Modified Duke criteria are applied as the standard diagnostic tool for all patients with suspected IE. Echocardiography is complementary for diagnosis. Transthoracic echocardiogram is usually the initial test in most patients， but a TEE is recom-mended when the initial transthoracic imaging is negative in\n\n【43】the setting of high clinical suspicion. A review of the litera-ture by Gonzalez-Alujas et al. reported TTE sensitivity ranges between 40% and 63% and that of TEE is 90-100%.In addi-tion to establishing the diagnosis of endocarditis， echocar-diography may also reveal complications such as valvular re-gurgitation or rupture， as well as the presence of an abscess or fistula formation.\n\n【44】Blood cultures should be obtained before the initiation of em-piric antibiotic therapy. The duration and dosage depend on the underlying pathogen. Two weeks of treatment with peni-cillin or ceftriaxone combined with an aminoglycoside is ef-fective in viridans group Streptococcal endocarditis in selected patients with uncomplicated infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The development of septic emboli in our patient led to the decision to prolong antibiotic treatment. Blood cultures are repeated until nega-tive to demonstrate the adequacy oftreatment. Repeat echo-cardiography is also utilized to track change in vegetations and to assess whether complications have developed. Current guidelines identify the specific indications for surgical inter-vention. These include valvular regurgitation resulting in acute heart failure， the presence of multi-drug resistant organisms or fungi， IE complicated by heart block or abscess formation， persistent bacteremia or recurrent emboli despite appropriate antibiotic therapy， and severe regurgitation with mobile vege-tations >10 mm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. It should be noted that these indications are based on studies in patients with left-sided native valve and prosthetic valve IE.\n\n【45】Except for recent dental prophylaxis， this patient had none of the other predisposing risk factors.

According to the modified Duke criteria， this patient would have fallen into the category of possible IE， with positive blood cultures for S. mitis drawn >12 h apart but without evidence of vege-tations detected on TTE， without other minor criteria at the time of presentation. The decision was made to proceed with TEE because there was no obvious source for bacteremia. At the recent dental procedure， our patient did not meet the cri-teria for prophylactic antibiotics.\n\n【55】Conclusions\n\n【56】This case presents the interesting and rare finding of endo-carditis isolated to the pulmonic valve in an otherwise healthy individual with no predisposing risk factors. Although the pa-tient had symptoms that may overlap with those of the flu， the duration of symptoms (3 weeks) should have been taken into account on the initial diagnosis. However， this case oc-curred during the winter of 2017-2018， a particularly bad flu season， in which an already overwhelmed ED may have suf-fered an availability bias. The lack of peripheral stigmata， as well as an unremarkable initial outpatient TTE， also made the diagnosis more difficult in this case. It should be noted that current guidelines do not specifically address right-sided en-docarditis， and do not specify the role of surgical intervention.\n\n【57】Conflicts of interest\n\n【58】None.\n\n【59】5\\.

This subsequently leads to a high mortality rate， which could be greatly reduced if treatment is instituted early， within 24 hours of perforation. Treatment ranges from conservative management to operative intervention depending on the time of presentation and the patient's clinical condition. Endoscopic intervention in the form of over-the-scope clip (OTSC) application is gaining popularity with very promising res ults.\n\n【17】Case Report： A 43-year-old male was diagnosed with Boerhaave’s syndrome and treated initially by insertion of bilateral chest drainage， intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics， and total parenteral nutrition. He was transferred to our facility 9 days later. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a 1.5 cm deep longitudinal ulcer involving the distal esophagus and extending to the Z-line. Due to the perforation site， a size 12 OTSC clip was used. Application of a second clip was needed to achieve complete closure of the perforation site. Contrast swallow was done 4 days later showed no leak. The patient was started on oral intake and was discharged home in good general condition after a hospital stay of 16 days.\n\n【18】Conclusions：\n\n【19】Delayed presentation of Boerhaave’s syndrome can be treated safely by an over-the-scope clip. This endoscopic method hastens recovery and shortens the hospital stay.\n\n【20】MeSH Keywords： Endoscopy， Gastrointestinal· Esophageal Diseases· Esophageal Perforation · Pleurodesis\n\n【21】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/916320\n\n【22】口1525\n\n【23】Boerhaave's syndrome is spontaneous perforation of the esophagus； most commonly the distal part， as a result of forceful emesis. The classical triad of sub-xiphoid retroster-nal pain， vomiting， and subcutaneous emphysema is present in a small number of patients， posing a formidable diagnostic challenge 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The management option depends on the time of perforation. Early presentation (within 24 hours) is com-monly managed surgically， but delayed presentation is man-aged conservatively， especially if the perforation is confined and the clinical condition of the patient is stable. However， delayed presentation and treatment is associated with inferior outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In recent years， endoscopic options are gaining popularity in the management of Boerhaave's syndrome. Such options include endoscopic stenting and over-the-scope clip-ping (OTSC) of the perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. We report here a case of successful management by the OTSC system of a patient with Boerhaave's syndrome who presented more than 9-days af-ter the perforation.\n\n【24】Case Report\n\n【25】A 43-year-old male was admitted to a nearby secondary hospi-tal after episodes of repeated forceful vomiting following alco-hol ingestion. He complained of severe epigastric， sub-xiphoid pain， and shortness of breath. An initial chest x-ray followed by computerized tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed left-sided hydropneumothorax， pneumo-mediastinum， and\n\n【26】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1. Chest computed tomography scan showing bilateral oral contrast extravasation from esophagus into the pleural cavity.</u>\n\n【27】para-aortic and para-esophageal air-fluid collections . The oral contrast at that time showed communication to both pleural cavities. The picture was diagnostic of esophageal per-foration and hence the patient was initially managed by inser-tion of bilateral chest tubes which brought purulent drainage， intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics， and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The patient condition became stable and he was transferred to our facility for further management at 9 days after his initial presentation.\n\n【28】On arrival to our hospital， the patient looked reasonably well with no distress and his vital signs were normal (pulse 85 beats per minute， blood pressure 139/92 mmHg， and temperature36.7°C). His O， saturation was 94% on 2 L of oxygen via nasal cannula and he had bilateral chest tubes which were drain-ing purulent discharge. The rest of the general examination was unremarkable except for decreased air entry and dull-ness in both lung fields. The initial blood tests showed hemo-globin 9.3 g/dl (normal range， 13-18 g/dl)， white cell count11.9x10/pL， platelets 581×10/pL， albumin 19 g/dL (normal range， 23-50 g/dL)， and the liver and renal panels were normal.\n\n【29】On the following day， he underwent an upper gastrointesti-nal endoscopy with fluoroscopic setup in place. This revealed a 1.5 cm deep longitudinal ulcer involving the lower esophagus and extending to the Z-line . The ulcer had a necrotic base seen clearly at retroversion . Due to the per-foration site and delayed presentation， an over-the-scope clip(OTSC) system was preferred rather than endoscopic stenting.\n\n【30】After the perforation site was assessed， a 12-mm OTS clip(OTSC； Ovesco Endoscopy， Tubingen， Germany) was preloaded over a transparent cap attached to the scope tip. The perfo-ration was centralized， and the edges of the perforation were approximated by applying full suction through the cap to pull the tissue into the cap. A clip was then released by rotating the wheel attached to the shaft of the endoscope . As only three-fourth of the perforation was closed by the first clip ， a second clip was applied to get a complete closure . Contrast x-rays that were done post-clip-ping revealed no leak .\n\n【31】On the fourth day after clipping， a contrast swallow showed no leak and he was started on oral intake with gradual dis-continuation of TPN. On the fifth day after clipping， a chest x-rays revealed presence of a fluid level in the left pleural cavity， so a CT scan was done showing features suggestive of em-pyema ， which was managed non-operatively by in-terventional radiology using pig tail drains. The output， which was initially purulent， gradually became serous over the fol-lowing 4 days. Bilateral chemical pleurodesis with bleomycin was later done and the chest tubes were removed.\n\n【32】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2.

The patient was seen in the out-patient clinic 14 days after discharge. He was well and toler-ating full diet with no other complications. A chest x-ray was done at that time was normal . He remained well at6-month follow-up.\n\n【36】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4.

Posteroanterior chest x-ray at 2-week follow-up showing small air fluid level at left.</u>\n\n【40】Spontaneous esophageal rupture (Boerhaave’s syndrome) is rarely encountered and hence its diagnosis is either missed or delayed leading to a high mortality rate that approaches 60%if time to theatre is delayed beyond 48 hours. However， the overall mortality in cases managed early， within 24 hours of presentation， is much lower at 20% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In addition to the de-lay in diagnosis and treatment， another major prognostic fac-tor in determining mortality is the site of the injury.\n\n【41】Conservative treatment is also advocated for those with delayed presentations but without sepsis. The recovery of such patients can be hastened by minimally invasive endoscopic means 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【42】It is recommended that all septic patients with esophageal per-foration should be treated surgically， and conservative treat-ment is reserved for patients presenting early without sepsis.\n\n【43】The hospital stay of our patient was 16 days； this was much shorter than that reported by others for delayed Boerhaave's syndrome treated by OTSC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. There is no doubt that the com-bined non-operative interventional radiology drainage of septic collection and the minimally invasive OTSC greatly contributed to the rapid recovery and short hospital stay. This combined\n\n【44】management strategy emphasizes the importance of a multi-disciplinary team approach for the management of this con-dition to minimize morbidity and mortality， and to achieve good outcomes.\n\n【45】In recent years， an increasing number of patients with esoph-ageal perforations are being managed by non-operative endo-scopic measures such as placement of covered self-expanding stents， over-the-scope clipping， or both a clip and a stent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. A covered self-expanding stent can achieve sealing of a leak in up to 50% of cases， and placement of a second stent in failed cases is not usually successful in sealing the leak 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The OTSC system is a clipping method for mechanical compres-sion of tissues in the gastrointestinal tract. It was first designed for the management of bleeding， perforation， and fistula 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， and hence， OTSC can be appropriately employed in the treat-ment of esophageal perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，5，8\\]</u>. It has been demon-strated that standard clips might not be as effective as OTSC as a primary therapy in sealing gastrointestinal bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In comparison to the conventional clips， OTSC has a greater compressive force and is more effective in achieving superior grip of fibrotic tissue， as in this case of delayed perforation. Moreover， OTSC offers easy application and maneuvering in tight anatomical positions. However， there is no clinical study to date that compares OTSC versus conventional clips，except one prospective randomized study that confirmed superiority of OTSC over standard methods used to control recurrent ul-cer bleeding (not perforation) in term of technical and clini-cal success 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【46】Our case presented late (9 days after perforation) to our fa-cility and the size of the perforation was 1.5 cm. Due to the site of the perforation， OTSC rather than stenting was applied with success. However， the closure could not be achieved by one clip and therefore， a second clip was applied. The resid-ual thoracic sepsis was treated by tube drainage and later by pleurodesis after clearance of sepsis. A review of the litera-ture for cases of delayed Boerhaave's syndrome treated by OTSC revealed 3 similar cases. The first successful endoscopic\n\n【47】References：\n\n【48】1\\.

Kircheva and Vigneswaran reported a case of a 53-year-old male patient who had failed OTSC followed by endoscopic stenting after failure of OTSC to seal the leak.

The history revealed that the symptoms began one year earlier after a minor trauma by a small nodule that was initially localized on the back of the right hand. This lesion had been surgically removed in a small dispensary with no histological proof. A month later similar lesions grew along the sides of the initial one resulting in a large multilobed exophytic painful tumour with purulent draining sinuses that goes all around the wrist with a similar smaller nodule on the dorsal face of the 2nd interdigital space and adjacent fingers of the same hand .

The rest of the examination revealed no other abnormalities.\n\n【19】We first suspected an infectious origin because the draining sinuses and the purulent discharge of the lesion， but bacteriologi-cal and mycological tests were negative. Multiples biopsies were performed revealing tiny specific signs. There was an essential inflammatory reaction in the dermis with many plasmocytes. Pseudoepitheliomatous epidermal hyperplasia was also noted with cysts and sinuses in the epidermis and no cellular atypia\n\n【20】After a radiological examination that confirmed that the le-sion was restrained in the skin， the patient underwent surgical excision of the whole lesion with 10 mm margins as we couldn't confirm the benign or malignant nature of the lesion. No no-ble structure has been exposed during the surgery， and daily fatty dressings were done with a splint of the wrist in a neutral position to avoid any deformation or stiffness.\n\n【21】Histological examination of the excised tissues finally con-cluded to a verrucous carcinoma with clear resection margins. A semi-thick skin graft was then made. \n\n【22】Control after surgery revealed good aesthetic results with no signs of relapse after one year of follow up. \n\n【23】Discussion\n\n【24】The term “verrucous carcinoma\" includes many nosological entities. It was first described by Ackerman in the oral cavity in 1948 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It's also used to designate the commonly known Buschke-Loewenstein a tumour or giant condyloma acuminata in anourogenital locations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The Carcinoma cuniculatum or\n\n【25】Fig.1.

Result three months after surgery\n\n【31】verrucous carcinoma of the skin is more uncommon. It was described for the first time by Aird et al. in 1954 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【32】Clinically， it manifests as a wide， slowly growing papilloma-tous， cauliflower-like tumour with sometimes multiples crypts and sinuses， thus the designation“cuniculatum\" which means rabbit burrow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The feet are the most affected areas in about90% of cases. However， any skin region can be involved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In the present case， clinical aspect and evolution were typical for a verrucous skin carcinoma but unusual by its localization on the hand which has rarely been reported in the literature.\n\n【33】The etiopathology of these tumours involves many factors. The most well-identified causative agent is HPV infection， espe-cially in the oral cavity， anogenital region， and the foot where the HPV is usually located. Other causative factors have been suggested such as chronic infections and scar tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【34】Histologically， the diagnosis can be difficult because of the misleading benign aspect of the tumour with very few cellular and nuclear atypia and low mitotic activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. It’s sometimes complicated to find the invasive proliferation that can be re-strained in a small portion of the samples and multiples biopsies are occasionally necessary to confirm the diagnosis as it was the case with our patient.\n\n【35】Verrucous carcinomas are good prognostic tumours that rarely metastasise. Complete surgical excision is usually suf-ficient， but relapses are not rare. Some cases of anaplastic trans-formation have been described mostly after radiation therapy which is now considered contraindicated in the treatment of these tumours. Other treatment modalities were used such as chemotherapy， immunotherapy and local therapy with non-conclusive results.7\n\n【36】Conclusion\n\n【37】Verrucous carcinoma of the skin is a rare variant of squamous cell carcinoma with a better prognostic. The diagnosis of this kind of tumours is usually difficult since the histopathological aspect can sometimes be misleading with very few specific signs and that's\n\n【38】precisely what our case illustrates. It’s therefore essential to insist on taking large and deep biopsies sometimes in multiples sites to avoid misdiagnosis.\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>References</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

The common mode of presentation of mediastinal seminoma is their inva-sion of neighboring tissues.\n\n【27】Treatment is possible by surgical excision， and che-motherapy should be reserved for patients who have metastases at the time of diagnosis. We present a rare case of 34-year-old man with primary mediastinal seminoma that was referred with superior vena cava(SVC) syndrome.\n\n【28】CASE REPORT\n\n【29】A 34 years old male with a 3-months history of dys-pnea. There was no significant past medical history， and he was taking no medications. He had experienced episodic headaches， flushing， visual blurring and dys-phagia during the previous several days.\n\n【30】In physical examination testicular volumes were normal and no testicular masses were palpable. Temperature was 37°C， blood pressure 120/70mmHg， and pulse 70 beats per minute， respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. Marked facial puff-iness and jugular venous distension was noted. Laboratory evaluation revealed a hemoglobin level of 14 g/dl， hematocrit 39.8%， white blood cell count\n\n【31】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1. Chest X-ray showing a large superior mediastinal mass.</u>\n\n【32】3000/mm’(polymorphonuclear 66%，lymphocytes31%， and eosinophiles 3%)， platelet count 235000/mm. Further laboratory studies revealed： serum lactic dehydrogenase level 422 IU/lit. (Normal <500IU/lit)， serum alkaline phosphatase level 303 IU/lit(Normal 100 to 290 IU/lit). Investigations showed that urea and electrolytes， liver function tests and urinalysis were normal. Westergren sedimentation rate was 7 mm/hour. Serum beta-hCG was 12.5 MIU/ml (Normal<10)， alfa-fetoprotein 3ng/ml (Normal 2to 16 ng/ml).\n\n【33】Chest X-ray  showed a mediastinal mass， which on CT scan was demonstrated to be due to a retrosternal mass within the anterior mediasti-num . Abdominal ultrasound showed no retroperitoneal or para-aortic lymphadenopathy. Results of testicular ultrasound examination were negative. Diagnostic procedure was thoracotomy， that revealed a large tumor in the anterior medias-tinum. Biopsy was taken from it. Histologically it was seen to be of well characteristic nesting pattern of tumor cells， separated by fibrous strands which contain scattered lymphocytes . The tumor cells have abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and the nuclei have a vesicular chromatin pattern . Histologically， the diagnosis was considered as a seminoma. The patient was treated with 4 cycles of PEB chemotherapy every 3 weekly (bleomycin15 units/m’ on day 1， etoposide 100 mg/m’ on days 1 through 5， and cisplatin 20 mg/m’ on days1 through 5). Sixteen months after chemotherapy， patient’s chest X-ray showed complete regression of the mass.\n\n【34】DISCUSSION\n\n【35】This case report is intended to add to the reported experience on primary mediastinal seminoma which is extremely rare.\n\n【36】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2. CT Scan shows homogenous retrosternal mass in the anterior of mediastium.</u>\n\n【37】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3.Photomicrograph shows discohesive cells separated by fibrous strands and surrounded by numerous lymphocytes(Hematoxylin and eosin， magnification ×10).</u>\n\n【38】Primary mediastinal seminoma (also called dysgermi-noma) is uncommon， representing only 2 to 4 percent of all mediastinal masses， but comprise 25 to 50 per-cent of malignant mediastinal germ cell tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-4\\]</u>. These neoplasms are usually located in the anterior mediastinum， and predominantly occure in young males between the ages of 20 and 40.\n\n【39】Mediastinal seminoma is rarely occure in woman with histologically normal ovaries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Mediastinal seminomas are large and bulky at the time of pre-sentation. Usually symptoms are non-specific and result from local invasion.\n\n【40】Seminomas are symptomatic more frequently than teratoma or other benign tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Substernal pain is the most frequent complaint， and dyspnea， weak-ness，cough， fever， hemoptysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， gynecomastia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>， and weight loss are occasionally present. Superior vena cava syndrome is the presenting syndrome in10 persent of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4， 7\\]</u>. In study of Holbert et al. in 20% of patients with primary mediastinal germ cell tumors， SVC syndrome were found 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Recently， Takeda et al.repored 13 patients with pure mediastinal seminoma， comprised 10% of primary germ cell tumor of the mediastinum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In this report there were 12males and 1 female， with a mean age of 27.6 years. Four patients (30.8%) were presented with SVC syn-drome. The tumors usually grow at the juncture of the innominate vein and the superior vena cava. As a tumor grows， it can compress the above structures and invade the adjacent fatty tissues. Metastases occasionally cause the first symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. We are satisfied that this\n\n【41】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4. Photomicrograph shows tumoral cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and round nuclei (Hematoxylin and eosin， magnification ×40).</u>\n\n【42】case was a primary mediastinal tumor for the following reasons： The absence of primary testicular lesion， the lack of abdominal lymph node metastasis； since it is uncommon for testicular seminoma to metastasize to mediastinum in the absence of retroperitoneal lymph node involvement， the lack of appearance of testicular masses during subsequent follow-up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【43】As with other anterior mediastinal tumors， the initial diagnosis is suggested by chest X-ray， CT-scan，or MRI. Highly sensitive and specific immunoassays for serum beta-hCG and alfa-fetoprotein allow dif-ferentiation between seminoma and nonseminomatous malignant germ cell tumors. There is an elevation in one or both markers in 90 percent of patients with nonseminomatous germ cell tumors in contrast， in pure seminoma， bete-hCG is elevated in only 7 per-cent of patients， and serum alfa-fetoprotein is almost never elevated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【44】Thus， an elevated serum alfa-fetoprotein concen-tration mandates treatment as a nonseminomatous tumor even if biopsy of the mass suggests pure seminoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【45】These tumors generally occur in asymptomatic young males and seem to be associated with a good prog-nosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【46】In patients with mediastinal seminoma chemotherapy has widely replaced radiotherapy as the initial treat-ment. Bokemeyer et al. reported that the prognosis of primary mediastinal and retroperitoneal seminomatous germ cell tumors are equivalent to that of their primary gonadal counterpart， with a 5-year survival of 88% in a meta-analysis of 104 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Schmoll recom-mended that patients with seminomatous extragonadal germ cell tumor should be treated according to their prognostic classification， with three cycles of cisplatin， etoposide and bleomycin (PEB) for the good prognosis patients， and four cycles of PEB for the intermediate prognosis patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Standard cisplatinum-based chemotherapy plus additional secondary surgery is the basis of treatment strategy. Radiotherapy is the treatment of choice for patients with definitive pro-gression under chemotherapy.\n\n【47】Patients with extra-mediastinal spread are generally given cisplatin-based chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.

The associated pain， for which opioids are commonly prescribed， can result in complications of respiratory dysfunction sec-ondary to impaired abdominal wall movement. Paravertebral nerve blockade has shown substantial efficacy in treatment of abdominal and thoracic pain， but its utility for pancreatitis pain and role in reducing hospital length of stay and narcotic use has not been well studied.\n\n【25】Case Report： A 41-year-old woman with longstanding history of recurrent pancreatitis controlled with celiac plexus blocks and oxycodone was admitted for severe left upper quadrant abdominal pain. The patient was admitted， made NPO， and started on I morphine. She underwent a left-sided T12-L1 paravertebral single shot injection and catheter placement， and experienced immediate relief. A Marcaine infusion was continued for 3 days and the patient required no additional narcotics while the catheter was in place. On hospital day 6， the catheter was removed and the patient was discharged.\n\n【26】Conclusions： Our case illustrates the successful use of continuous thoracic paravertebral nerve blockade in a patient with pancreatitis. This intervention resulted in a significant reduction in narcotic requirements. As the number of hospitalizations and mean cost for acute pancreatitis has increased over the years despite an in-house mor-tality decrease， targeting cost reduction via length of stay reductions is key. Optimizing pain management in these patients is one way in which we can reduce LOS and thereby cost. We believe paravertebral nerve block-ade is a viable analgesic option worth exploring in this patient population.\n\n【27】Keywords： Acute Pain·Nerve Block·Pancreatitis\n\n【28】Ful-text PDE https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/934189\n\n【29】Acute pancreatitis (AP) is the leading gastrointestinal cause of hospitalization in the United States， with a reported annu-al incidence of 40 to 50 per 100 000 people.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>Along with flu id resuscitation and nutritional support， treatment consists of management of pain， which can be severe and result in com-plications of respiratory dysfunction secondary to impaired ab-dominal wall movement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Opioids are commonly prescribed for this purpose. Despite this longstanding relationship， dele-terious effects have been associated with their use， including an increased risk of acute pancreatitis attacks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. To reduce such effects， several alternatives have been successfully uti-lized for analgesia in AP. For inpatient treatment， thoracic epi-dural analgesia has been shown to improve pancreatic perfu-sion and exert an anti-inflammatory effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. A study on 1003ICU patients with severe acute pancreatitis showed reduced mortality at 30 days in 46 patients who received epidural an-algesia versus systemic therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Celiac plexus blocks have also been used in acute and chronic pancreatitis， with mixed results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>. In regional anesthesia， paravertebral nerve block-ade has shown substantial efficacy in treatment of abdomi-nal and thoracic pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， but its utility for acute pancreatitis-related pain and specified role in reducing hospital length of stay and narcotic use has not been well studied. In 1948， the paravertebral nerve block was theorized as having a therapeu-tic role in AP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Additionally，there is 1 case report describ-ing the successful use of the erector spinae plane (ESP) block for AP pain in the ED 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In addition to somatic analgesia， an ESP block is thought to offer visceral analgesia via sympathet-ic blockade， and its success is partially attributed to incidental spreading of local anesthetic into the paravertebral space 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. One may hypothesize then that a paravertebral block would carry a higher success rate for coverage of sympathetic-me-diated pain. The following case illustrates the use of continu-ous thoracic paravertebral nerve blockade as part of a multi-modal treatment strategy for a patient with acute pancreatitis.\n\n【30】Case Report\n\n【31】A 41-year-old obese woman with history of recurrent pancre-atitis was admitted for a 3-day history of severe left upper quadrant abdominal pain. She had a longstanding history of acute pancreatitis with related hospital admissions， but report-ed the pain had been well controlled for a year with intermit-tent celiac plexus blocks and 5 mg of oxycodone twice daily. Recently， she stopped receiving the blocks as her insurance no longer offered coverage， and the pain subsequently returned. The patient was admitted for management of acute pancre-atitis， made NPO， and started on 4 mg lV morphine every 4 h. The patient endorsed mild improvement with this regimen. On hospital day 3， the anesthesia pain service was consulted for\n\n【32】the patient's persistent abdominal pain despite lV analgesia. On hospital day 4， she underwent a left-sided T12 paraverte-bral single shot injection with 0.5% Marcaine with epinephrine and catheter placement. The patient experienced immediate relief， reporting a reduction of pain from 10 to 0. A thoraco lumbar XR confirmed placement of the catheter at the T12-L1interspace.Infusion of 0.125% Marcaine was continued for 3days and the patient required no additional narcotics while the catheter was in place. Moreover， as the patient's abdom-inal pain subsided she was able to tolerate enteral nutrition following block placement. On hospital day 6， the catheter was removed and the patient was discharged on the same day.\n\n【33】Discussion\n\n【34】The use of paravertebral nerve blockade resulted in a signifi-cant reduction in narcotic requirements. In comparison to epi-dural analgesia， paravertebral catheter use can offer potential benefits， including less risk of hypotension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>， which is par-ticularly important in severe acute pancreatitis. It may be pre-ferred in patients with hemodynamic lability， pre-existing neu-rological disease， or challenging thoracic spine anatomy. It may also confer less risk and resource utilization than use of a celi-ac plexus block for the inpatient setting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. While the erector spinae block， similar to a paravertebral block， is theorized to block the ventral and dorsal rami of the spinal nerves and the rami communicantes， which transmit sympathetic fibers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>， the paravertebral block resulted in immediate 0/10 pain in our patient， who required no opioids during catheter infusion. This appears to be superior to the ESP block performed in the case report described above， in which opioid administration was still required after block placement. Since local anesthet-ic spread during an ESP block is dependent on indirect spread from the erector spinae plane， cadaveric studies have shown inconsistent spread to both the ventral rami and paraverte-bral space 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. This would be the likely explanation in cas-es where desired analgesia is not achieved with an ESP block.\n\n【35】Since its use cannot predictably ensure all local anesthetic en-ters the paravertebral space 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>， an ESP block's success rate for visceral sources of pain may be variable. It should be noted that an ESP block has successfully been used to treat visceral pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Therefore， the superiority of a paravertebral nerve block is likely more pronounced in cases of multifactorial pain， in patients with low pain thresholds， and in patients with a his-tory of opioid dependence， as was the case with our patient.\n\n【36】There are a few discussion points in regards to location of cath-eter placement and ideal duration. Although the paravertebral catheter was placed at T12-L1， the level of the celiac plexus， it seems the spread of local anesthetic was sufficient to cov-er the lower thoracoabdominal nerves， which would explain\n\n【37】why the patient experienced relief despite the catheter being placed low relative to the origin of these nerves. This is consis-tent with reports of multisegmental longitudinal spread found with paravertebral blockade， including 1 case report show-ing 8-thoracic segment spread after lopamidol injection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Moreover， a study of 28 patients found that injections made in the more ventral part of the thoracic paravertebral space anterior to the endothoracic fascia versus dorsal using nerve-stimulator guided technique resulted in more multisegment spread 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. This suggests precision of placement in the para-vertebral space makes a significant difference in ensuring local anesthetic spread and thereby predictable analgesia.\n\n【38】The optimal duration of indwelling catheter placement is un-clear. Long-term use of PVB catheters have been reported， in-cluding a 1-year period for persistent mastodynia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Similarly， post-herpatic neuralgia was successfully treated with 3 weeks of intermittent injections via a thoracic PVB catheter with no complications reported， and no pain at 8-months follow-up通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Long-term catheter placement has some limitations， including slight infection risk， catheter migration， and need for patient oversight 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>， but is an option worth exploring.\n\n【39】From a public health perspective， the innovation and creativity inherent to implementing regional methods into the acute pain setting play a large role in mitigating the propagation of opioid dependency in the U.S. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Developing alternative strategies like this one is integral to this process. One limitation of this\n\n【40】References：\n\n【41】1\\. Guo A， Poneros JM.

Bleeding often occurs when the platelet count is <20 000/uL. The disease can progress because of accompanying COVID-19 disease.\n\n【14】Case Report：\n\n【15】A 9-month-old boy， weighing 8.5 kg， came to the hospital with petechiae on the forehead， cheeks， mouth，and extremities. The patient had rhinorrhea for 3 days previously and was febrile， pale， weak， and could not drink. He had the measles-rubella vaccination 19 days prior. Physical examination showed no abnormalities of the eyes， ears， nose， throat， and mouth. Heart and lungs were within normal limits， with no organomegaly，lymph-adenopathy， or congenital anomaly of the abdomen. Laboratory examination showed hemoglobin， 12.7 g/dL； leukocytes， 7420/uL； platelet count， 16 000/uL； and hematocrit， 37.9%. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was14 mm at 1 h and 21 mm at 2 h. Peripheral blood smear showed normal RBC morphology normal leukocytes， and few platelets. IgG was reactive and IgM was nonreactive on rapid antibody test. RT-PCR was positive for SARS-COV-2. Chest-X-ray showed pneumonia. The diagnosis was newly diagnosed ITP with COVID-19. Patient was treated with 30 mg/kg body weight/day of l methylprednisolone for 3 days (250 mg)； then 20 mg/kg body weight/day (175 mg) orally for 4 days in 3 divided doses. Azithromycin 100 mg/day zinc 20 mg/day， and vitamin C 50 mg/day orally were also given.\n\n【16】Conclusions： COVID-19 screening is highly recommended during this pandemic to identify it as a potential cause of child-hood ITP.

Approximately two-thirds of chil-dren with primary ITP have a history of viral infection during the previous month 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Viruses commonly identified as trig-gers of ITP include cytomegalovirus， hepatitis C， herpes， vari-cella-zoster， Epstein-Barr， influenza， and HIV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-5\\]</u>. ITP is a po-tential presentation of COVID-19. Tsao et al reported the case of a 10-year-old girl who had ITP and a positive reverse tran-scriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result for se-vere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. SARS-CoV-2 viral testing should be considered in these patients to allow for appropriate hospital triaging and isolation to lim-it community spread and healthcare worker infection during pandemics. We report the case of an infant with ITP that was likely caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【23】A 9-month-old boy， weighing 8.5 kg， came to the hospital with petechiae on the forehead， cheeks， mouth， and extremities. He had rhinorrhea for 3 days previously and was febrile， pale， weak， and could not drink. The patient had the measles-rubella vac-cination 19 days prior. Physical examination showed a respira-tion rate of 32 breaths per min and heart rate of 100 beats per min. The examination of the eye， ear， nose， throat， and mouth showed no abnormalities. Examination of the heart， lungs，and upper and lower extremities showed no abnormalities. There was no organomegaly， lymphadenopathy， or congenital anomaly of the abdomen. The laboratory findings are shown in Table 1. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 14 mm at 1 h and 21 mm at 2 h. A peripheral blood smear showed normo-chromic and normocytic red blood cells， normal leukocytes，and few platelets. The patient’s blood type was B. Urinalysis results were within the standard range. IgG was reactive and IgM was nonreactive on the rapid antibody test. A chest X-ray showed pneumonia. The diagnosis made was newly diagnosed ITP with\n\n【24】Table 1.

The patient was treated with 30 mg/kg body weight/day of intravenous (I) methylprednisolone for 3days (250 mg)， and then 20 mg/kg body weight/day (175 mg) oral methylprednisolone for 4 days in 3 divided doses. The pa-tient was also given azithromycin 100 mg/day， zinc 20 mg/day， vitamin C 50 mg/day. The patient's skin petechiae appearance can be seen in Figure 1. The chest X-ray showed mild right up-per-lobe opacity， as shown in Figure 2.\n\n【29】On day 2 of treatment， the initial RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was performed， and the result was positive， confirming COVID-19. The results of routine blood tests， including com-plete blood count and blood chemistry on days 2， 4， and 16， are shown in Table 1. After 2 IV administrations of 250 mg methylprednisolone， the platelet count was 82 000/uL.The pa-tient's condition improved， and the petechiae were significant-ly reduced. On day 4 of treatment， the second RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was negative. Because the patient’s condition was good and the petechiae were gone， the patient was discharged. The patient went home with oral methylprednisolone and did not undergo tapering of methylprednisolone. Nine days after stopping methylprednisolone (day 16)， the patient's condition was stable. There were no signs of corticosteroid side effects such as “moon face\"， and the platelet count was 181 000/uL. The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio was 0.42.\n\n【30】Discussion\n\n【31】According to the course of the disease， ITP in children is divid-ed into 3 types： 1) newly diagnosed， with diagnosis within 3months， accounting for 50% of cases； 2) persistent ITP， within3 to 12 months from diagnosis， accounting for 25% of cases； and 3) chronic ITP， more than 12 months from diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【32】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2. Chest X-ray showed mild right upper-lobe opacity.</u>\n\n【33】ITP most commonly occurs in children 2 to 7 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The incidence of pediatric ITP is 4.3 per 100 000 children per year， and in children aged 2 to 5 years， the incidence is high-er in boys than in girls 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. This disease is rarely found in in-fants less than 1 year old， probably because of the immature baby's immune system. In general， there is always a history of viral infection of the upper respiratory tract or gastrointes-tinal system or immunizations 2 to 4 weeks before diagnosis通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In a study including 257 pediatric patients with ITP，Yong et al reported a history of infection in 20.2% of patients and immunization in 8.6% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In comparison， Hashemi et al report-ed a history of the common cold in 47% of cases and a his-tory of immunization in 25.8% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In the present case， the patient was febrile and had rhinorrhea for 3 days previously. Also， the rapid antibody test was reactive for IgG and nonre-active for IgM， and the positive RT-PCR test for SARS-COV-2meant the patient was in the late or recurrent stage of infec-tion. Therefore， ITP was triggered by SARS-COV-2 infection and was not related to the patient’s immunization history. However， ITP could have been associated with the patient's immuniza-tion history and， at the same time， the patient had COVID-19.\n\n【34】Bleeding often occurs with a platelet count <20 000/uL. Purpuric， mucosal， and intracranial hemorrhage was found in 83.3%， 40.95%， and 3% of cases， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. A to tal of 80% of children with ITP who have acute bleeding will recover within days or weeks with or without treatment and will recover within 6 months. The platelet count will return to normal (>150 000/uL) in 50% of cases within 1 to 3 months and in 60% to 75% of cases within 6 months of the onset of thrombocytopenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，11\\]</u>. In the present case， the patient pre-sented with petechial bleeding， was febrile for 3 days previ-ously， was weak， and could not drink. The complete blood count results showed a platelet count of 16 000/uL and the peripheral blood smear showed few platelets. The rapid an-tibody test result was reactive for IgG and was nonreactive for IgM. A chest X-ray showed pneumonia. This situation was an emergency because platelet counts of only 16 000/uL in-dicate a high risk of intracranial bleeding. Intracranial bleed-ing is rare， occurring in only 0.5% to 1.0% of cases when the platelet count is <10 000/uL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>； however， this risk should be considered. In emergency cases， intravenous immunoglob-ulin (IVIG) can be given； however， it is expensive (the family in this case could not afford it)， and therefore a megadose of methylprednisolone， which is inexpensive， was given instead of the usual dosage. A 30 mg/kg body weight/day dosage of methylprednisolone was given for 3 days and then 20 mg/kg body weight/day was given for 4 days. Albayrak et al report-ed no significant differences in ITP treatment to achieve nor-mal platelet values with either IVIG 0.5 g/kg body weight/day for 5 days or methylprednisolone 50 mg/kg body weight/day for 7 days or methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg body weight/day for 7 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Our patient's condition was improving with the megadose of methylprednisolone. On day 2 of treatment， the platelet count rose to 82 000/uL. On day 4， it was 315000/uL， and the petechiae disappeared. To discharge the pa-tient on day 4 of treatment， the second RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was performed， and the result was negative. The pa-tient went home in good condition. In the present case， there was no tapering of methylprednisolone， and it was shown that9 days after the methylprednisolone was stopped， the plate-let count was 181 000/uL and there were no signs of bleed-ing. In 2 weeks， remission was achieved.\n\n【35】The course of COVID-19 in children is generally mild and has better outcomes overall compared with that of adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14-17\\]</u>. Fever， cough， and sore throat are the most frequent symp-toms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，17，18\\]</u>. Research in China of 2143 children with sus-pected COVID-19 showed that the proportions of severe and critical cases by age group were 10.6% for <1 year， 7.3% for1 to 5 years， 4.2% for 6 to 10 years， 4.1% for 11 to 15 years， and 3.0% for 216 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. The hematological profile of an infant or child with COVID-19 is not specific. Several studies have shown the presence of leukopenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>， leukocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>， or normal leukocyte counts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18，21，22\\]</u>. Henry et al reported\n\n【36】that leukocytes were not an indicator of the disease's sever-ity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Other reports have shown that neutropenia is most common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18，20\\]</u>. Generally， lymphocytosis has been found in in-fants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Kosmeri et al stated that platelets are generally nor-mal in children with COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.Ambike and Bijarniya stated that thrombocytopenia is rare in children with COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>， but Kharoud et al and Yarali et al reported that there is also thrombocytosis in children with COVID-19通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18，20\\]</u>. Inflammatory biomarkers are usually increased，such as the ESR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Pediatric patients with COVID-19 also showed an increase in AST and ALT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. In some cases， there was an increase in ESR， AST， ALT， and lymphocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21，22\\]</u>. Even though our patient had not shown signs of difficulty breathing， the patient was fe-brile， the ESR was increased， the chest X-ray showed pneu-monia， and the PCR test was positive； therefore， we gave the patient azithromycin. According to the Indonesian COVID-19management protocol， children with pneumonia and a pos-itive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 should be given azithromycin， corticosteroid， vitamin C， and zinc 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Vitamin C and zinc had been given to increase the immune system of the child 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.\n\n【37】The main goal of ITP treatment is not merely to increase the platelet count to an expected value， but is to achieve an ef-fective platelet count to stop bleeding. Generally， if the plate-let count is above 30 000/uL， the clinical experience will be better. In the present case， the platelet increment was sig-nificant even after the methylprednisolone pulse was given only twice. After 4 administrations of methylprednisolone，the platelet count had reached an expected value of 315 000/uL.\n\n【38】At the start of the disease， we cannot differentiate between acute and chronic ITP. In infants with ITP， 9% will have chronic ITP. In children with ITP aged 25 to 119 months， 18% will de-velop chronic ITP， and in children 2120 months with ITP， 47%will develop chronic ITP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Jung et al reported that 85.9%of children with ITP would have remission and 14.1% would have chronic ITP； the prognostic factors for chronic ITP are chil-dren of an older age and the slow appearance of clinical symp-toms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Makis et al reported that the prognostic factors for developing chronic ITP are age >10 years， no previous infection history， longer duration of clinical manifestations， and initial platelet count >10 000/uL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. Other investigators reported that the prognostic factors that provided complete remission when ITP was established were a low mean platelet volume level <8 fL and previous infection history 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. The prognosis of patients with COVID-19 is inadequate if the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio is 23.13 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. If the treatment of acute ITP is required， megadose methylprednisolone is the most effective and affordable approach. The chronicity of acute ITP would probably be less with megadose methylprednisolone treat-ment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. In the present case， the patient was 9 months old at the time of initial diagnosis of ITP， with a history of illness3 days before presentation， bleeding that appeared suddenly，\n\n【39】initial platelet count <20 000/uL， neutrophi. to lymphocyte ratio of 0.42， and complete remission within 2 weeks； there-fore， the prognosis of this patient was good， and he will not develop chronic ITP.\n\n【40】Conclusions\n\n【41】COVID-19 screening is highly recommended during this pan-demic to identify it as a potential cause of childhood ITP. In cases when IVIG is not available or the patient is financially disadvantaged， megadose methylprednisolone can be an ef-fective and inexpensive primary choice. Megadose methyl-prednisolone should be given in the acute phase of ITP to in-crease the platelet count as soon as possible.\n\n【42】References：\n\n【43】1\\. Kuhne T， Buchanan GR， Zimmerman S， et al.

It can present as an isolated condi-tion or a part of various syndromes. The excess gingival tissue can cover part or the entire crown of the tooth， and can re-sult in diastemas，teeth displacement or retention of primary or permanent teeth. It may also cause masticatory， phonetic， psychological， and esthetic issues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. The condition can also result in pseudo-pocketing and periodontal problems due to difficulties with maintaining an appropriate oral hygiene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Routine treatment of minimal and local gingival overgrowth relies on maintaining proper oral hygiene and/or root scaling， while cases of advanced， diffuse gingival enlargement require extensive surgical intervention. Recurrence can appear sever-al months to several years after surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-8\\]</u>.\n\n【29】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

Intraoral clin-ical examination revealed a painless，firm， and pale pink tissue covering 30% of her teeth crowns in the maxilla and mandible. Panoramic radiograph showed normal positioning of her twelve permanent teeth (i.e.， 16，12， 11， 21，22，26， 36，32， 31， 41， 42， 46) and twelve deciduous teeth (i.e.， 53，54，55，63，64，65，75，74， 73，83，84，85) that were also visible dur-ing intraoral examination. X-ray also showed fifteen unerupt-ed (permanent) teeth (i.e.， 17， 15， 14， 13， 23， 24，25， 27，37，34， 33，43， 44， 45，47) and normal alveolar bone height. Tooth12 and 22 were present in regular position， however， slightly rotated， while tooth 35 was imperceptible . The pa-tient did not use any medications. A similar condition was pres-ent in three other family members； for example the patient's mother reported gingival overgrowth first at the time of decid-uous dentition and then during eruption of permanent teeth. The results of patient's physical examination， medical histo-ry， laboratory tests， and histopathological evaluation of tissue sections excluded any genetic disease/syndrome or neoplastic growth. The patient was diagnosed with HGF.\n\n【34】Surgery was performed at the age of 11 years because of func-tional， hygienic， and psychological reasons. The patient also required orthodontic treatment. After proper oral hygiene was\n\n【35】old female diagnosed with diffuse， hereditary gingival fibromatos is：twelve permanent teeth (i.e.， 16，12，11，21，22，26，36，32，31，41，42，46)， and twelve deciduous teeth (i.e.，53，54，55，63，64， 65，75，74，73，83，84，85) in normal position， fifteen unerupted (permanent) teeth (i.e.， 17，15，14，13，23，24， 25， 27， 37，34，33，43， 44， 45，47) and normal alveolar bone height are visible.

A periodontal dress-ing (Septo-pack， Septodont， Poland) was applied， post-oper-ative instructions were given， and chlorhexidine rinses were prescribed. Two weeks， one month， and three months after first surgery， the patient was re-called for control visits， when post-operative oral hygiene instructions were reinforced. The healing was uneventful， however， four weeks after surgery in the mandible， and two weeks after excision in the maxilla， the recurrence of overgrowth was seen in both dental arch-es. The recurrence within the mandible comprised approxi-mately 45% of the pre-operative tissue volume， whereas in the maxilla， the tissue overgrowth attained 25% of the initial volume . At three months follow-up， any significant，\n\n【43】additional growth in the mandible was noted， while in the max-illa， the recurrence comprised 40% of the initial， pre-operative volume. On palpation， the regrown gingiva was more dense， firmer， and less elastic with a rougher surface compared to that at pre-operative status. Despite the unusually rapid rate of recurrence within the first four weeks after surgery， a grad-ual decrease of the recurrence ratio was observed in the fol-lowing two months. The patient did not complain about bleed-ing and problems with hygiene or chewing and was satisfied with the improvement of aesthetics. She was under outpatient care with control vis its once every three months. Further sur-gical intervention was not planned as long as her periodontal health and function would not be affected by the excessive mass of gingival tissue.\n\n【44】Histopathological evaluation of gingival biopsies revealed thick-ened epithelium with elongated rete ridges extending local-ly into connective tissue. Abundant fibroblasts were accom-panied by numerous bundles of collagen fibrils and moderate blood vessels throughout subepithelial and dense connective tissue . The examination of gingival biopsies by po-larized light microscopy showed a significant increase ofthin， green-birefringence fibrils i.e.， corresponding to fibrotic fi-brils that contributed 80% of the total pool of collagen fibrils. In contrast， in healthy gingiva thin fibrils consti-tuted only about 25% of the total pool .\n\n【45】Discussion\n\n【46】HGF is a condition characterized by etiological heterogene-ity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，5\\]</u>. The diagnosis is dependent on a thorough history， clinical examination， panoramic radiographs， histopathology， and laboratory tests.

Standard treatment consists of surgical excision of the lesion by means of scalpel， cautery， or laser after the establishment of a proper oral hygiene.\n\n【48】Clinical features of this condition， including the rate of recur-rence， may differ among families as well as between the mem-bers of the same family， however， the reasons for such varia-tions are currently unknown. The family of our patient presents an example， where a recurrence was noted a year after sur-gery in the patient's mother 5\\]， whereas no recurrence was present in patient's sister. In other reported cases， recurrence was not observed， while in some cases， disease relapse oc-curred from several months to several years after treatment. Kavvadia et al.通用删除7(英):<u>(2005)</u> reported a case of an 11-year-old male with diffuse idiopathic gingival fibromatosis and the absence of eruption of permanent teeth.

Kelekis-Cholakis et al.通用删除7(英):<u>(2002)</u> presented a case of management of a 13-year-old female with progressive HGF.

Another full-mouth gingivectomy did not reveal any signs of recurrence a year later 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【49】Linkage analysis of HGF patients revealed several chromosom-al regions that may contain mutations responsible for isolat-ed， non-syndromic autosomal dominant forms of HGF.

This mutation has been suggested as one possible etiological factor for isolated， non-syndromic HGF. Considering the genet-ic background and heterogeneity of HGF， we postulate that the variable rate of recurrence of this condition may be asso ciated with the presence of some mutations， but this hypoth-esis needs further investigation.\n\n【67】Histological analyses of gingival tissue from reported case with HGF，stained by picrosirius red， showed a significant increase of thin， green-birefringent fibrils that correspond to the fibrotic fi-brils.

This case highlights the importance of early recognition of herpes simplex virus infection in neonates and demonstrates that prompt management and treatment results in favorable outcome.\n\n【34】Case Report\n\n【35】An 11-day-old male presented to the Emergency Department with worsening rash， fever， and poor feeding. The patient was born full-term to a G2P1 mother via normal spontaneous vag-inal delivery and had regular prenatal follow-up， with no pre-natal or postnatal complications， and was discharged home on day 2 of life. Birth weight was 3575gand birth length was 21inches. According to the mother， the patient started develop-ing a rash on the lower eyelid on day 4 of life and developed a similar rash in the left axilla， as well as around the umbili-cus. Subsequently， the baby had 2 days of lethargy and poor feeding. There was no history in either parent of past or cur-rent HSV outbreaks， and the mother's HSV titers were never checked. The mother was not on any medication throughout the pregnancy， and she never reported a history of genital le-sions or sexually transmitted infections. In addition， the pa-tient had no known sick contacts.\n\n【36】Upon arrival to the Emergency Department， the patient was found to be febrile (101.3°F\\[38.3C\\]) with stable vitals. A full sepsis work-up was completed and the initial lab results showed an ALT of 2862 U/L (7-55 U/L) and AST>1000 U/L (8-60 U/L). The PT was>100 s (10.3-12.8 s)， PTT 35s (26-36 s)， and the INR was indeterminate . The initial CSF re-sults showed a glucose level of 45 mg/dL (70-140 mg/dl)， protein level of 82 g/L (62-80 g/L)， WBC 50.0 cells x10/uL(5.0-20.0 cells x10/uL)， and RBC 2 million/mm丫 (4.3-5.9 mil-lion/mm3) . CSF culture and HSV PCR were sent， and ceftriaxone， ampicillin， and acyclovir were started. The patient was admitted to the PICU for further management of suspected\n\n【37】Table 1.

While in the PICU， the patient began desaturating and required 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula. The patient was then transferred to a higher-lev-el facility for further management. During the PICU course， the patient was hemodynamically stable. The patient had increas-ing abdominal distention， moderate hepatomegaly， mild sple-nomegaly， and ascites confirmed by ultrasound. Transaminases were trended throughout the hospital stay， with the highest AST 8718 U/L and ALT 2498 U/L . The patient contin-ued to require 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula； however， due to increased respiratory distress， he was started on na-sal intermittent mechanical ventilation， and thereafter was in-tubated and placed on synchronized intermittent mechanical ventilation (SIMV) after developing bilateral HSV pneumonitis. A skin viral culture was done and was positive for HSV 2. The video electroencephalogram and a brain MRI were normal. The patient was weaned off of SIMV after resolution of pneumo-nitis and was then stable on room air. After 19 days of acyclo-vir， an CSF HSV PCR was still positive for HSV 2. Acyclovir was then continued for a total of 28 days. On day 26， a third CSF HSV PCR was sent and was still positive for HSV 2. The fourth CSF HSV PCR was negative and the patient completed a 35-day course. The discharge AST was 37 U/L and ALT was 30 U/L. On discharge， the patient was tolerating full feeds， with good suck and swallow， and at 4 months of age has no neurologi-cal deficits and did not need a liver transplant. Currently，he is on oral suppressive antiviral therapy for a total of 6 months.\n\n【43】Discussion\n\n【44】We present a case of fulminant hepatic failure with dissem-inated neonatal HSV， including CNS， blood， and skin involve-ment. To the best of our knowledge， this is only the second documented case of neonatal HSV with fulminant hepatic fail-ure in the U.S.， with no neurological complications and a suc-cessful outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【45】In the adult population， 1.5 million new cases are diagnosed each year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Around 5% of all women of childbearing age report a history of HSV-2 infection， and approximately 30%have antibodies to HSV-2 and 2% of the women acquire HSV2 infection during pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，14\\]</u>. About 75-90% of pa-tients with HSV-2 are not aware of the presence of the infec-tion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6，13\\]</u>. Similarly， in most cases of neonatal HSV there has been no known history or report of maternal external gen-ital lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6，13\\]</u>. The typically asymptomatic nature of this disease facilitates the transmission to the population and the fetus while the mother is infected. The prevalence of mater-nal genital herpes simplex infection while giving birth has in-creased by 30% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. HSV infection raises concerns about in-creased risk of viral transmission during childbirth.\n\n【46】Although intrapartum transmission is the most common route of transmission in the neonate， HSV can be transmitted to the neonate before or after delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，14\\]</u>. Approximately 85%of HSV transmission in the neonate is during vaginal deliv-ery， via an infected birth canal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，6，13，14\\]</u>. Approximately 5%of all cases of neonatal HSV infections are a result of in utero\n\n【47】transmission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，14\\]</u>. In neonates， there are 3 different dis-ease presentations in the setting of HSV： SEM (skin， eyes， and mucous membranes)， CNS， and disseminated infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Neonates may or may not have the classic vesicular rash as-sociated with most HSV infections； therefore， treatment in the setting of disseminated and CNS disease is often delayed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【48】Abuhasna et al. described a case of a 4-day old infant born to a mother with no prior history of HSV， who presented with fever， lethargy， and respiratory distress 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. The case report was the first documented case featuring a neonate with ful-minant liver failure surviving following medical treatment. The infant was found to have fulminant hepatic failure with HSV-2detected by viral PCR. The infant was treated with 6 weeks of acyclovir therapy and recovered without developing CNS dys-function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Yamada et al. presented a case of a 4-day-old neonate with fever and increased transaminases and lactate dehydrogenase. The patient developed disseminated HSV in-fection， which resulted in acute liver failure and hemophago-cytic lymphohistiocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. With the use of high-dose acy-clovir and anti-cytokine therapy， this patient recovered without the need for a liver transplant and showed no neurological deficit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Similarly， Pilorget et al. published a case report of an 8-day-old infant presenting with fever， seizures， vomiting， and liver dysfunction. This patient was treated with high-dose acyclovir and survived with complete recovery from neonatal HSV hepatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Contrary to the neonates presenting ear-lier in their illness in the previously published cases， our pa-tient presented late， on day 11， with disseminated HSV. Our case clearly demonstrates that early initiation of appropriate therapy and clinical management can result in a favorable out-come. Although the patient had abnormal laboratory findings signifying neonatal HSV infection with hepatic failure， he did not require a liver transplant and survived without any focal abnormalities.\n\n【49】An increase in liver transaminases is associated with increased mortality and morbidity in neonates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Depending on the de-gree of severity of liver involvement， liver transplantation is a treatment option often utilized in the pediatric population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Furthermore， the presence of vesicles in patients with hepat-ic disease may suggest a less severe course of illness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Our patient presented to our institution with vesicles and rash. Although the liver transplant team was consulted， correction of liver transaminases followed a medical course of acyclovir.\n\n【50】Disseminated HSV infection has also been known to trigger neonatal hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.HLH is characterized by fever， hepatosplenomegaly， CNS symptoms， cytopenias， coagulopathy， lipid changes， and elevated ferritin levels exceeding 10 000 pg/L (20-250 pg/L) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17，19\\]</u>. Our case did not have the hallmark feature of a massively elevated fer-ritin level and no hemophagocytes were seen in the peripheral\n\n【51】blood smear. The patient was improving with antiviral thera-py and there was no suspicion of HLH.\n\n【52】Guidelines for the treatment of neonatal fulminant liver fail-ure state that treatment with acyclovir should be initiated when a diagnosis of HSV infection is suspected， as early ad-ministration is associated with decreased mortality and mor-bidity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，10，18\\]</u>. Early detection with PCR provided the oppor-tunity for prompt and adequate treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【53】The International Herpes Management Forum (IHMF) guidelines outline the diagnosis， prevention， and effective management of neonatal herpes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Neonates with suspected disseminat-ed HSV infection or HSV encephalitis should be immediately treated with intravenous acyclovir (60 mg/kg/day) for at least21 days. Guidelines should be established to recheck PCR for the virus， and treatment should be continued until the PCR result is negative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，7，10，15\\]</u>. Rechecking the PCR consistent-ly and discontinuing acyclovir treatment only after CSF PCR is negative should be the standard of care in neonates pre-senting with neonatal HSV encephalitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，7，15，19\\]</u>. The ther-apy should be followed with oral suppression therapy with300 mg of acyclovir per square meter per dose administered3 times daily for 6 months after initial treatment of neonatal HSV disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，16，20\\]</u>. Follow-up treatment with oral acyclo-vir is shown to reduce recurrence of skin lesions in neonates and to reduce CNS complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，16，20\\]</u>\n\n【54】According to American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' guidelines， the risk of transmission of HSV in neonates can be reduced by performing Cesarean delivery in cases of active maternal genital lesions or prodromal symp-toms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. In addition， it is common practice to provide sup-pressive therapy with acyclovir or valacyclovir near the end of pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Despite preventive measures with suppressive therapy， viral shedding is still known to occur； therefore， neo-natal infection is still possible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Physicians and residents alike should be on high alert to diagnose and treat HSV infec-tion in neonates， as early detection and treatment are associ-ated with lower morbidity and mortality 5，9，17\\].\n\n【55】Conclusions\n\n【56】To the best of our knowledge， this is only the second document-ed case of disseminated HSV infection with fulminant hepatic failure in the United States that presented late and achieved recovery with no obvious sequela. Due to early recognition and immediate treatment， the case had a positive outcome with-out the need for a liver transplant. HSV is difficult to recog-nize in a clinical setting and a high degree of clinical suspicion is required. Neonates presenting with lethargy， poor feeding， somnolence， and other nonspecific symptoms in absence of a\n\n【57】clear diagnosis should be tested for HSV. Mandating HSV test-ing via PCR in neonates， may lead to early diagnosis and pre-vention of more severe sequela of herpes infection. Another recommendation is starting acyclovir immediately upon pre-sentation， before the diagnosis has been confirmed. A CSF PCR should be performed multiple times beyond 21 days of ther-apy with acyclovir to check for persistence of the virus， and the treatment regimen should be extended beyond the stan-dard 21 days to ensure resolution. This case report emphasiz es and promotes awareness of early recognition and appro-priate clinical management of neonatal HSV infection， and its positive outcome.\n\n【58】References：\n\n【59】1\\.

These tumors can spread to the brachial plexus and spine and present with symptoms that appear to be of muscu-loskeletal origin.\n\n【20】Case Report：\n\n【21】A 59-year-old Asian man presented to a chiropractor in Hong Kong with a 1-month history of neck and shoul-der pain and numbness that had been treated unsuccessfully with exercise， medications， and acupuncture. He had an active history of tuberculosis， which was currently treated with antibiotics， and a 50-pack-year history of smoking. Cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed urgently， revealing a small cervical disc herniation thought to correspond with radicular symptoms. However， as the patient did not respond to a brief trial of care， a thoracic MRl was urgently ordered， revealing a large superior sulcus tumor invading the upper to mid-thoracic spine. The patient was referred for medical care and received radiotherapy and chemothera-py with a positive outcome. A literature review identified 6 previously published cases in which a patient pre-sented to a chiropractor with an undiagnosed Pancoast tumor. All patients had shoulder， spine， and/or upper extremity pain.\n\n【22】Conclusions：\n\n【23】Patients with a previously undiagnosed Pancoast tumor can present to chiropractors given that these tumors may invade the brachial plexus and spine， causing shoulder， spine， and/or upper extremity pain. Chiropractors should be aware of the clinical features and risk factors of Pancoast tumors to readily identify them and refer such patients for medical care.\n\n【24】Keywords： Chiropractic· Lung Neoplasms· Mycobacterium tuberculosis·Neck Pain· Pancoast Syndrome·Shoulder Pain\n\n【25】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/937052\n\n【26】￥o 2411 盟1 山可5 目日25\n\n【27】Pancoast tumors， also called superior sulcus tumors， are a rare type of lung cancer that invade the apical chest wall 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. These tumors can be challenging to identify in practice and are of-ten misdiagnosed， as their symptoms often resemble benign musculoskeletal conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Pancoast tumors may invade the brachial plexus， sympathetic chain， and/or vertebral bod-ies， causing a constellation of symptoms termed Pancoast syn-drome， which may include spinal， shoulder， and upper extrem-ity pain and/or weakness， as well as Horner's syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，3\\]</u>. The most common initial symptom of Pancoast tumors is shoulder pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Chiropractors only rarely encounter patients with undiagnosed cancer， yet these patients are important to identify and re-fer for medical care. In a 2012 survey of chiropractors in the United States， respondents reported encountering a patient with undiagnosed cancer about once every 8 years on aver-age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.

Importantly， as illustrated in the current case， tuberculosis is a significant independent risk factor for lung cancer (hazard ratio of 1.6) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【30】Given the potential for chiropractors to rarely encounter pa-tients with undiagnosed cancer， we present a case of Pancoast tumor invading the spine， which was first identified in a chi-ropractic office.\n\n【31】Case Report\n\n【32】Patient Information\n\n【33】A 59-year-old Asian man presented to a chiropractic clinic in HKSAR with a 1-month history of aching and numbness of his posterior neck and bilateral shoulders. He had an active6-month history of tuberculosis， which caused an occasion-al productive cough， and was under medical treatment with a spectrum of antibiotics during this time (ie， isoniazid， rifampin， pyrazinamide， and ethambutol)， as supervised by a specialty chest hospital with monthly follow-up visits and serial chest radiographs every 1-2 months.\n\n【34】The patient's tuberculosis was first suspected 6 months prior after he developed a cough and underwent chest radiography. This was followed up by a Mantoux test， which was strongly positive. His previous providers also initially scheduled a flexi-ble fiberoptic bronchoscopy， but latercanceled it as his sputum culture was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis， and chest computed tomography (CT) findings were compatible with tu-berculosis. At this point he began pharmacologic treatment for tuberculosis with directly observed therapy， which continued through presentation to the chiropractic office.\n\n【35】He described that the neck pain began secondary to episodes of coughing and had negatively impacted his sleep quality. The patient reported an 8 out of 10 pain severity on the numeric rating scale. He had a 50-pack-year history of smoking， was a social drinker， and worked as an interior decorator. The pa-tient had a medical history of hereditary elliptocytosis， and at age 33 had a spontaneous pneumothorax. He denied having a history of cancer. His family history was significant for lung cancer (mother) and hereditary elliptocytosis (father). The pa-tient endorsed occasional hoarseness but denied any bowel or bladder symptoms.\n\n【36】Previous treatment for his neck pain directed by his primary care provider included prescription pain medications (nonste-roidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen) and reha-bilitation exercises provided by a physical therapist. The pa-tient also had received acupuncture for his neck pain. As no previous treatments provided the patient relief， he sought out chiropractic care .\n\n【37】The patient's most recent chest radiograph report from 1 month prior reported patchy airspace opacities with a nodular appear-ance in the right upper lung zone， suggestive of pneumonia. Review of a report of his high-resolution computed tomogra-phy (CT) of the thorax from 6 months prior noted right apical fibrocalcific changes， mild bronchiectasis， tiny nodules up to2 millimeters in both lungs， and shotty non-enlarged medias-tinal and hilar lymph nodes. There was no mention of a sus-picious lung mass or tumor in these reports.\n\n【38】Clinical Findings\n\n【39】On physical examination， the patient appeared physically fit. The chiropractor noted muscle hypertonicity of the paraspinal muscles from C5 to T2， rhomboids， and teres minors. Cervical range of motion was severely restricted in extension and right rotation and moderately restricted in all other planes. Maximal foraminal compression testing on each side exacerbated the patient's shoulder pain and paresthesia. A motor examination revealed 4/5 strength (Medical Research Council Scale) of the right deltoid， with pain.\n\n【40】O Am J Case Rep， 2022； 23：e937052\n\n【41】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

More serious pathology， including spinal tuberculosis， was also considered as a possibility. Considering the patient had severe pain， neurologic deficits， had failed previous conservative care， and had red flags including active tuberculosis， a family histo-ry of lung cancer， and history of smoking， the chiropractor or-dered a cervical spine MRI on the day of the first visit， which was performed within the facilities'imaging center on an ur-gent basis. A cervical spine MRI was ordered initially as the pa-tient's symptom distribution， sensory loss， and motor deficit suggested a mid- to lower cervical radiculopathy， involving the lateral regions of both shoulders and right deltoid weakness.\n\n【46】The cervical spine MRI revealed no serious pathology but did identify a small cervical disc protrusion at C6-7， without corre-sponding central canal or neuroforaminal stenosis .

The patient's case was evaluated and managed by several specialists， including oncology and ortho-pedic spine surgery. CT-guided fine-needle aspiration was per-formed， revealing a histopathologic diagnosis of adenocarci-noma. The patient underwent follow-up CT of the thorax with contrast， which revealed areas of vertebral necrosis from T1to T6. He also underwent full-spine MRI with gadolinium con-trast， which additionally revealed an enhancing right epidur-al extension seen at the T2/3 to T5/6 disc levels causing cord compression and displacing the spinal cord to the left. Erosion and destruction of the corresponding head and contiguous part of right 3rd-5th ribs was also noted.\n\n【56】The spine surgery team deemed the patient to be ineligible for spine surgery due to the extent of the tumor invasion and necrotic involvement of multiple vertebral levels. The patient was initially treated with oral dexamethasone 4 mg qid and radiotherapy， then received ongoing chemotherapy under the care of an oncologist. After starting chemotherapy and radio-therapy， at 2 months' follow-up the patient noted he current-ly felt lighter and had less severe neck and shoulder pain and numbness. He noted he could sleep longer but still had severe pain upon waking for 2-3 hours， which subsided through the day. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient to publish this case report and any accompanying images.\n\n【57】In this case， the patient's cervical disc herniation was likely not the cause of symptoms as it was small and not causing nerve compression. If the C6-7 disc had caused nerve compression， this would have more likely presented as a C7 radiculopathy with further distal symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. While annular fissures can cause discogenic pain， these are frequently asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. While neck pain was briefly reduced， it is possible this was due to a generalized hypoalgesic effect of spinal manipulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Conversely， the patient's symptoms were improved with last-ing effects via radiotherapy and chemotherapy， suggesting that the Pancoast tumor was responsible for his symptoms.\n\n【58】More specifically， the patient’s symptoms were likely caused by tumor invasion of the brachial plexus (ie， Pancoast syn-drome). This is a common phenomenon in Pancoast tumors， which often involves the middle and inferior trunks of the bra-chial plexus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In the current case， the middle trunk was po-tentially involved， as this gives rise to the axillary nerve and axillary superior lateral cutaneous nerve， and could account for both the patient's deltoid weakness and shoulder numb-ness， respectively.\n\n【59】Pancoast tumors may be suspected via their risk factors， such as smoking， male sex， age in the 6h decade， clinical features of Pancoast syndrome， and imaging findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Radiographic series， in particular the anteroposterior lordotic view， may be a first step in evaluating for a Pancoast tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. However， these lesions can be missed by chest X-rays 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Chest CT can\n\n【60】be used to confirm the presence of an apical mass， while MRI may be used to characterize any brachial plexus or spinal in-volvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. As in the current case， when neck， shoulder， and/or upper extremity symptoms and examination findings are not explained by cervical spine MRl， thoracic and/or bra-chial plexus MRI could be considered as next steps.\n\n【61】A literature search using the search terms“chiropractic，\"“chi-ropractor，\"“superior sulcus\" and“Pancoast\" was conduct-ed via PubMed， Google Scholar， and the Index to Chiropractic Literature on April 18， 2022， to identify other cases in which patients with an undiagnosed Pancoast tumor presented to a chiropractor. In addition， review articles on the topic of chi-ropractic case reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> and chiropractic care and cancer通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，14\\]</u> were hand-searched for relevant cases. This search identified 6 articles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15-20\\]</u>， each describing a single patient with an undiagnosed Pancoast tumor who presented to a chi-ropractor. The clinical features of each previous case， includ-ing the current case (in total 7)， were summarized .\n\n【62】Among the previously published cases and current case， pa-tients were predominantly male (6 of 7 cases)， with a mean age of 53 (SD)+8 years. This limited sample is concordant with the epidemiologic features of Pancoast tumors， which have a male predominance and most often present in the 6h decade of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Multiple patients had a risk factor or red flag for lung cancer， which was commonly smoking (5 of 7 cases)， while in the current case both smoking and tuberculosis were risk factors. In 5 cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，17，19，20\\]</u>， including the current case， the chiropractor identified the Pancoast tumor or referred the patient for medical evaluation， while in 2 cases the chiroprac-tor did not identify or suspect the Pancoast tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16，18\\]</u>.\n\n【63】An important finding noted among these cases of Pancoast tu mor presenting to chiropractors is that each patient present-ed with shoulder， spine， or upper extremity symptoms. While these are common symptoms of Pancoast tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，11\\]</u>， they are also frequent concerns that prompt patients to seek chi-ropractic care in general 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. It is thus possible that patients seek chiropractic care because they believe the symptoms to be benign and of a musculoskeletal origin.\n\n【64】The role of chiropractors involves not only treatment but ex-amination， diagnosis， and case management. Importantly， chiropractors must conduct a thorough history and exami-nation to assess for serious pathology. This helps guide the treatment and determine whether to administer high-velocity， low-amplitude spinal manipulation， which is contraindicated in the case of spinal malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. In the current case， gen-tle manual therapy techniques were used as a precaution un-til there was more diagnostic information given the patient's extensive red flags.\n\n【65】First， as a single case， the course of care may not be broadly generalizable， especially to countries with a low incidence of tuberculosis or different chiropractic practice characteristics. While chiropractors have the authority to order MRI in HKSAR and the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23，24\\]</u>，they may not be able to in oth-er countries， given the scope of practice. Diagnostic imaging may be more commonly used by HKSAR chiropractors， with36% using MRI at least sometimes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>， compared to 1% of chiropractors in other countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>， which could have affect-ed the diagnostic pathway in the current case. Alternatively， chiropractors who do not have MRI readily available may refer patients suspected of having Pancoast tumor to other medi-cal specialists for further evaluation. Second， our conclusion that the patient's brachial plexus was involved was based on the available clinical and radiologic evidence， whereas electro-diagnostic testing and brachial plexus MRl could have made the exact neuroanatomical site(s) of involvement of the tumor clearer. Third， it is unclear if the patient's Pancoast tumor was simply missed in his previous chest imaging or was not read-ily visible， as images were unavailable from his chest hospi-tal upon request and only imaging reports could be obtained. Likewise， exact details regarding the patient’s chemotherapy， radiotherapy， and post-treatment imaging were unavailable. Fourth， the chiropractic clinician may have accelerated the di-agnosis of Pancoast tumor by ordering thoracic MRl in addi-tion to cervical MRI on the initial day of consultation， but the patient's clinical features guided the clinician's working diag-nosis toward a cervical radiculopathy. While cost and scanning time of MRI may be general factors to consider， a more com-prehensive， multi-region imaging strategy could be useful in patients at risk for lung cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.\n\n【66】Conclusions\n\n【67】Chiropractors should be aware that patients may present to their office with shoulder， spine， or upper extremity pain caused by a previously undiagnosed Pancoast tumor， as its symptoms often resemble those of common musculoskeletal conditions. Typical risk factors for Pancoast tumor are illus-trated in the current case， including male sex and smoking， while tuberculosis is another important risk factor in regions where it is endemic. Chiropractors should refer patients sus-pected of having Pancoast tumor in a timely manner for ap-propriate medical care.\n\n【68】Department and Institution Where Work Was Done\n\n【69】New Chiropractic and Physiotherapy Centre， EC Healthcare， Hong Kong.\n\n【70】All figures submitted have been created by the authors who confirm that the images are original with no duplication and have not been previously published in whole or in part.\n\n【71】References：\n\n【72】1\\.

Untreated Lyme disease can af-fect other organs. This can lead to anion gap metabolic acidosis through severe renal failure. Unlike anion gap metabolic acidosis， osmolar gap can be caused by ingestion of ethanol， toxic alcohols， solvents， and salicylates. Therefore， a presentation with osmolar gap and anion gap metabolic acidosis yields a variety of differential diagnoses.\n\n【24】Case Report：\n\n【25】A 72-year-old man presented after being found down. There were few historical cues， and workup was nega-tive for seizures or any acute cerebrovascular incident. Laboratory results were revealing of severe anion gap acidosis with osmolar gap. During clinical decision making and diagnostic dilemma， toxidrome syndromes for potential ingestions and inhalations were sought in addition to thorough workup， which expanded to include infectious etiologies. This patient’s presentation was unique： Lyme disease in the setting of severe anion gap metabolic acidosis with an osmolar gap.\n\n【26】Conclusions： The outcome of critically ill patients can be determined by the clinician’s method to address the diagnostic di-lemma and quality of supportive care. Critically ill patient outcomes can be subject to the clinician's method to address a diagnostic quandary. This unique case poses an important reminder for clinicians to maintain their standard methodologies of critical thinking amidst the noise of distracting medical information.\n\n【27】Keywords： Acidosis · Critical Care · Infectious Disease Medicine · Lyme Disease · Neurotoxicity Syndromes\n\n【28】Abbreviations： AV -atrioventricular； CSF- cerebral spinal fluid； ICU - Intensive Care Unit\n\n【29】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/939196\n\n【30】口22044 山可甘3 目日12\n\n【31】Publisher's note： All daims expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of their affiliated MP organizations， or those of the publisher the editors and the reviewers.

He had a history of hypertension， sensorineural hearing loss， and a recent episode of generalized weakness and presumed tran-sient ischemic attack 1 week prior， without residual deficits. He was not on any home medications. History was obtained by his wife， owing to his mental status. His wife denied his-tory of tobacco， alcohol， or illicit drug use. He lived in a high-ly endemic area of the Midwest and lived in a rural， wooded setting. A few days prior to admission， he had been working in the brush， and the day of admission， had been cleaning mold from his garage without any solvents or chemical cleaners.\n\n【36】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

He did not have any witnessed tremors or neurological changes. He was not wit-nessed to be inhaling or ingesting substances.\n\n【38】Upon arrival at the Emergency Department， he had bradycar-dia， with a heart rate of 54 beats per min and a first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block， and had hypertension， with a blood pressure of 223/54 mmHg. He had hypothermia， at 33.4℃. No focal neurologic deficits were identified， and he had a low Glasgow Coma Scale of 6 and profound metabolic acidosis(pH of 6.9)， for which he was intubated. There was initial con-cern for seizures， for which he was treated with levetiracetam. Head computed tomography (CT) was unremarkable for acute intracranial changes. Ultimately， given concern for seizure， he was transferred to the neurological Intensive Care Unit (ICU).\n\n【39】In the neurological ICU he was treated with a rewarming pro-tocol for hypothermia.

Shortly after this， his leu-kocytosis improved (white blood cell count 13.6×10/L)， and his mental status improved to near baseline by hospital day6. Once his mental status cleared， he endorsed that approxi-mately 1 week prior to admission， he found an insect bite af-ter clearing brush； however， he was unsure from what type of insect. His first-degree heart block and bradycardia resolved. He transferred out of the ICU on hospital day 11.\n\n【59】Discussion\n\n【60】This case demonstrates a diagnostic dilemma of a common disease with an unusual presentation. Although clinicians can be faced with a plethora of distracting medical data， this case highlights that patient outcomes are associated with careful differential methodology by clinicians. The profound metabolic acidosis with a pH of 6.94 and bicarbonate level of 7 mmol/L on venous blood gas in the setting of an anion gap of 27 and osmolar gap of 20 mOsm/kg suggested a differential of po-tential causes to include glycol intoxication， oxoproline tox-icity， L-lactate， D-lactate， methanol， aspirin， renal failure， and ketoacidosis. Ethylene and propylene glycol were negative， acetaminophen and salicylate levels were negative， metha-nol level was negative， and the patient did not have any ke-tones in his urine to suggest ketoacidosis. The lactate level and white blood cell count were rising， but after initial inten-sive care management， including broad spectrum antibiotics， intravenous fluids， and hemodialysis， the lactate level normal-ized， as well as the leukocytosis. The source of the patient's anion gap metabolic acidosis seems to be most related to re-nal failure in the setting of an uncovered tickborne infection.\n\n【61】Despite the patient's initial presentation of hypothermia， he was harboring Lyme disease， which is traditionally associated with fever 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Upon collection of the tickborne panel， the pa-tient's wife noted that he often spent time outdoors. This pa-tient had a reactive lgG antibody in the CSF for B. burgdorferi， but the lgG antibody index of CSF was within the reference range . With the positive IgM and IgG for Lyme， the\n\n【62】most likely cause of his presentation was Lyme disease. This diagnosis can explain the significant renal failure causing the anion gap and osmolar gap metabolic acidosis， encephalopa-thy， and first-degree AV block 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In severe cases of Lyme dis-ease， patients can develop renal and respiratory failure， espe-cially in late presentation without treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Interestingly， as stated previously， he was evaluated 1 week prior in a local ED for generalized weakness. Workup at that time was sug-gestive of a transient ischemic attack， and he was later dis-charged home. Weakness may have been the initial onset of his symptoms of Lyme disease， and thus he potentially went untreated for at least 1 week. While acute renal failure can be an explanation for his presentation， his initial creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels were within normal limits of his baseline. His cystatin C level was elevated， and his esti-mated glomerular filtration rate was 46 mL/min/BSA；howev-er， this still may not fully explain the profound electrolyte de-rangements. Lactic acidosis can contribute to hyperkalemia and profound metabolic acidosis. Given that his lactate lev-el was 10.8 mmol/L， it is believed that this may have been a larger contributor to his electrolyte derangements.\n\n【63】We retrieved 1 case report related to Lyme disease present-ing with severe metabolic acidosis with anion gap. This case demonstrated a similar metabolic presentation， but was from known chronic Lyme disease， which was actively being treat-ed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However， although the patient was altered on presen-tation， since he was being treated for chronic Lyme disease， his diagnosis was already established to guide a differential diagnosis more specifically. That patient also developed neu-rological deficits， which were appreciated on brain imaging. In contrast， the patient in our case was unable to provide a histo-ry on presentation and did not have a known history of Lyme disease or specific signs on presentation to suggest Lyme dis-ease. Therefore， not only was this case unique in the setting of acute Lyme disease with severe anion gap metabolic acidosis with profound altered mentation without intracranial chang-es on imaging， the diagnostic dilemma of differentiating the plethora of medical data adds to the uniqueness of this case. The initial presentation widens the possibilities for differentials that can distract from a common illness such as Lyme disease.\n\n【64】When clinicians obtain an abundance of data， they can devel-op cognitive overload that can distract from the typical ap-proach to differential diagnosis. In the present case， the dif-ferential diagnosis based on distractors included 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> previous evaluation for transient ischemic attack prior to presentation could suggest primary neurological issue； 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> comatose state with no obvious story to suggest inhalation or ingestion；通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> osmolar gap metabolic acidosis， which more commonly coin-cides with toxicological etiologies； 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> the patient improved with initial round of dialysis and near simultaneous adminis-tration of hydroxocobalamin for possible cyanide poisoning； and 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> positive serologies for lgG and IgM Lyme antibodies that resulted after the previous 4 distractors were already in process. Objectively， the patient presented with an anion gap and osmolar gap metabolic acidosis. Drug screening tests were negative， and there was no history of ingestion or inhalation of foreign substances. While it is possible the patient ingest-ed or inhaled something to explain his osmolar gap， it is less likely given his history and laboratory results.\n\n【65】References：\n\n【66】1\\. Lyme Disease.

This report describes a 4-year-old Polish girl with progressive hearing loss and delayed speech development diagnosed with Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome who was treated with ribo-flavin (vitamin B2) and cochlear implants.\n\n【17】Case Report：\n\n【18】The case report concerns a girl from Poland who， at the age of 2 years 10 months， developed progressive atypi-cal neurological symptoms of unknown etiology： ataxia of the upper and lower limbs， gait abnormalities， gener-alized muscle weakness， vis ual and hearing problems， and regression of speech development. A karyotype study(whole-exome sequencing) revealed alterations within SLC52A2， leading to the diagnosis of Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome and initiation of high-dose riboflavin treatment. As a 4-year-old child， she presented to the Institute of Physiology and Pathology of Hearing-World Hearing Center in Poland with progressive hear-ing loss and speech regression. Hearing tests revealed bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss with au-ditory neuropathy. Surgical treatment was applied in the form of bilateral cochlear implantation.\n\n【19】Conclusions：\n\n【20】This report shows the importance of genetic testing in infants who present with atypical symptoms or signs. In this case， the diagnosis of Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome resulted in timely correction of the genetic riboflavin (vitamin B2) deficiency and improved hearing following the use of cochlear implants.\n\n【21】Keywords： Polyneuropathies· Auditory Neuropathy·Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere Syndrome · Cochlear Implants·Hearing Loss· SLC52A2 Protein， Human\n\n【22】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/940439\n\n【23】￥o 36 52 盟1 山合：2 35\n\n【24】Publisher's note： All daims expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of their affiliated\n\n【25】AP\n\n【26】organizations， or those of the publisher the editors and the reviewers.

The origin of the disease is a mutation of the genes SLC52A2 and SLC52A3， inherited and autosomally recessive， encoding the riboflavin transporters RFVT2 and RFVT3， respec-tively， resulting in impaired intestinal riboflavin transport and reduced riboflavin concentrations in the body 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. The symp-toms consist of progressive sensorineural hearing loss with auditory neuropathy features， pontobulbar palsy (dysphagia， dysarthria)， muscular weakness， sensory ataxia of the limbs and trunk， vision loss， and respiratory failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-5\\]</u>. Diagnosis of BVVL is based on genetic testing for mutated SLC52A2 and SLC52A3 genes， but treatment with riboflavin can be started based on suspicion and clinical observations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. The prima-ry treatment for BVL syndrome is supplementation with high doses of riboflavin (vitamin B2) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，6\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Riboflavin (vitamin B2) is a water-soluble organic chemical compound composed of ribitol and flavin that is absorbed by active transport in the upper small intestine. Inside cells，ribo-flavin is converted into its bioactive coenzymes： flavin mono-nucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). These are cofactors involved in oxidative phosphorylation and are an essential component in the metabolism of carbohydrates， proteins， and fats 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，7-10\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome is caused by an autoso-mal recessive mutation in the SLC52A2 and SLC52A3 genes， which encode the riboflavin transporters RFVT2 and RFVT3 re-spectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，3，11\\]</u>. The RFVT3 transporters are located in the small intestine and are responsible for the absorption of vita min B2 from the gastrointestinal tract and resorption in the kidneys， whereas the RFTV2 transporters are responsible for the distribution of vitamin B2 to tissues and are more high-ly expressed in the nervous system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，3，7，12\\]</u>. A mutant form of the RFVT3 transporter results in reduced plasma levels of riboflavin， and its coenzyme forms FMN and FAD due to im-paired uptake. Reduced B2 transport leads to impaired mito-chondrial activity and ultrastructural abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8-10，13\\]</u>.\n\n【30】The motor nerve dysfunction in BVVL caused by RFVT2 defi-ciency is due to abnormal myelin permeability. Thin or leaky myelin results in increased permeability of the myelin sheath， as riboflavin is an important cofactor in myelin synthesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，10\\]</u>. Such impaired permeability would explain the postsynaptic na-ture of the auditory neuropathy underlying the hearing loss in BVVL syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，13，14\\]</u>.\n\n【31】To date， more than 100 cases of Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syn-drome have been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，15\\]</u>. The vast majority of cases\n\n【32】are males， and because of the higher disease burden， males with the syndrome die earlier than females. Onset of the dis-ease ranges from infancy to the third decade of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，16\\]</u>.\n\n【33】The symptom most closely associated with BVVL syndrome is pontobulbar palsy with features of dysarthria and dysphagia， involving of the lower cranial nerves (VII， VIII， IX， X， Xl， and XII， and less commonly upper ll to VI) and motor neurons， the lat-ter causing muscle weakness and sensory ataxia of the limbs and trunk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，3，4，16\\]</u>. As the disease progresses， it can lead to irreversible diaphragmatic dysfunction with symptoms of re-spiratory failure. The first symptoms of BVL are sometimes preceded by viral infection， surgery， or trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，16\\]</u>.\n\n【34】Before 2010， when the cause of the syndrome was unknown， diagnosis was based on clinical observations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. The cur-rent basis for diagnosis is genetic testing for mutated SLC52A2and SLC52A3 genes.\n\n【35】The aim of this study was to present a case of Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome and to describe the method of treating the deep sensorineural hearing loss associated with this syn-drome using cochlear implants\n\n【36】To date， 9 cases of patients diagnosed with BVL syndrome who were candidates for cochlear implantation have been described in the literature. The mean age at diagnosis was6 years 8 months (SD=5)， the age at which hearing loss was detected ranged from 18 months to 14.5 years (M=7 years 9months，SD=4.66)， and in 6 patients auditory neuropathy was confirmed with no response in an auditory evoked response test with otoemission. Seven patients in this group had used hearing aids， while speech discrimination benefit was limited despite riboflavin therapy. Consequently， 8 patients received cochlear implants， 1 of them bilateral 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，15，17-20\\]</u>.\n\n【37】Based on data from the available literature， Table 1 lists the patients for whom a decision was made to proceed with a co-chlear implantation.

Hearing screening at birth was normal. Initially， psychomotor and speech development was normal.\n\n【51】At the age of 2 years 10 months， the parents noticed the child’s first symptoms： clumsiness of movement，stumbling， increased tiredness， and pain in the right knee. Over time， the ailments increased： the child did not want to stand on her feet， fell over， and eventually stopped walking on her own. When sit-ting， she could hardly keep her balance. There was suspicion of hearing loss and deterioration of vision， there was a swal-lowing disorder and coughing when drinking， and she had de-terioration in speech.\n\n【52】Due to symptoms of unclear etiology and the progressive nature of the disease， the patient was repeatedly hospitalized in the Department of Pediatrics and Neurology and the Department of Pediatric Infectious Disease.\n\n【53】Neurological examination revealed features of ataxia in the up-per extremities， dysmetria， a shaky gait with a stagger to the right on a wide base， trunk ataxia， right-sided functional sco-liosis， and lower-limb ataxia with predominance of the right side. Deep reflexes from the upper extremities were present but weak， reflexes from the lower extremities were absent， and abdominal skin reflexes were present but weak.\n\n【54】In addition， the parents noticed problems with visual acuity：myopia， and later horizontal nystagmus.Ophthalmologic ex-amination revealed normal pupil responses to light， and no anterior or posterior eye abnormalities. An evoked visual po-tentials test could not be performed.\n\n【55】After an electromyography neuromuscular conduction study， there was a suspicion of generalized damage to the sensory fibers of the peripheral nerves， primarily of an axonal nature.\n\n【56】Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and cervi-cal and thoracic spine showed no abnormalities apart from a5-mm pineal cyst (a stable lesion with no progression on sub-sequent examination)， while lumbosacral MRI showed thick-ening of the spinal nerve roots with normal signal. The image was primarily consistent with post-inflammatory lesions of the meningeal sac in the L-S segment with ‘holdingin adhesions of the spinal nerve roots.\n\n【57】A lumbar puncture was also performed， which revealed no ce-rebrospinal fluid lesions.\n\n【58】Laboratory tests showed elevated levels of phosphocreatine kinase and aspartate aminotransferase， and slightly elevated urea， sodium， and potassium. PCR analysis searching for vi-ral central nervous system infection was negative. However， assays for metabolic defects by tandem mass spectrometry showed a lowered free carnitine concentration of 5.6 umol/L(normal range， 7.3-86).\n\n【59】During a cardiology examination， echocardiography showed left ventricular enlargement with normal systolic function. The electrocardiogram showed a negative P-wave of 2 mm in the Vi lead (which did not meet the criteria for left atrial hyper-trophy). In contrast， the patient did not show features of dys-pnea， with O，saturation of 98-99%.\n\n【60】A differential diagnosis included genetic and autoimmune causes， encephalomyelitis， Guillain-Barre syndrome， viral in-fection， neuroblastoma tumor， CLN2 disorders， and Newman-Pick type C disease.\n\n【61】In view of the clinical picture and test results， it was decid-ed to institute treatment with pulses of glucocorticosteroids. After the problems worsened， immunoglobulin preparations were administered by infusion， with some improvement ob-served in muscle strength， fine and gross motor skills， and speech.Continuous physical rehabilitation was recommended.\n\n【62】The first genetic test for SCA cerebellar ataxia type 1， 2， or 3 was negative. In the karyotype study performed at MedGen Genetic Clinic， whole-exome sequencing was performed， and variants detected in genes correlated with the patient's symptoms were analyzed (the test was performed at the age of 3 years7 months). In the analyzed panel of genes， changes within the SLC52A2 gene in each allele were detected， with 2 pathogenic changes： a mutation localized within p.Cys159Trp(c.477C>G) and a p.Gly306Arg (c.916G>C)-heterozygous genotype. The re-sults of the genetic test finally provided a diagnosis of Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome at the age of 3 years 9 months， allowing treatment to begin.\n\n【63】The positive genetic diagnosis for this patient was also able to confirm Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome in the patient's younger sister， who was at an earlier stage of the disease. The younger girl exhibited a somewhat atactic gait， a balance disorder， kyphoscoliosis， sensory disturbance， dysarthria， and bilateral hearing loss requiring classic hearing aids. Since be-ginning vitamin B2 supplementation， the hearing loss has not progressed. In the family history， the other siblings -a young-er brother and older children from a previous relationship of the mother - remain healthy. The parents are not related. The exact genetic status of other family members is not known.\n\n【64】After BVVL syndrome was confirmed， riboflavin (vitamin B2) supplementation in large doses was immediately introduced. The disease has not progressed since treatment began. Physical rehabilitation and early developmental support classes have continued.\n\n【65】The patient's hearing loss was first suspected at the age of 3years 3 months. The child asked many questions and required repeated commands. The first result of an auditory evoked potentials test at the age of 3 years 3 months was normal. Recordings from stimulation of the right and left ears showed normal values of latencies and intervals.Another ABR exami-nation 9 months later showed bilateral unresponsiveness for0.5 kHz and click (2-4 kHz). During this period， the patient did not wear hearing aids.\n\n【66】An otolaryngological examination revealed normal eardrums bilaterally， but reduced motor skills in the larynx. The child did not communicate verbally， but shouted and used gestures， body movements， and eye contact. She did not respond to sudden environmental sounds.\n\n【67】Another ABR test was performed，which showed no response bilaterally for 0.5， 1， 2， and 4 kHz. In impedance audiometry， there were As-type tympanograms in the right ear and A-type in the left， and absent stapedius muscle reflexes both ipsilaterally and contralaterally bilaterally. An otoacoustic emission study recorded bilateral responses at all frequencies tested. Bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss with features of auditory neuropathy was found. The patient was qualified for cochlear implantation， initially in the right ear and then in the left ear.\n\n【68】At the age of 4 years 4 months， the team at the Institute of Hearing Physiology and Pathology- World Hearing Center in-serted a Med-El Synchrony cochlear implant according to the PDT procedure in the patient's right ear， followed 7 months later with another in the left. The procedures were per-formed using Skarzyhski's minimally invasive 6-step proce-dure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21-24\\]</u>. Standard electrodes were inserted through the round window and encountered little resistance. No compli-cations were reported.\n\n【69】The patient remains under the care of the Institute of Physiology and Pathology of Hearing World Hearing Center and is under-going rehabilitation after cochlear implantation. Audiograms measured 5 months after implantation in the right ear and 4months in the left ear are shown in Figures 1 and 2. Tests were performed using behavioral observation audiometry and visu-al reinforcement audiometry since the patient’s cooperation is limited and responses are difficult to assess. Five months after the implantation to the right ear， the mean postopera-tive free-field thresholds determined by behavioral observa-tion audiometry (average frequency for 0.25， 0.5， 1， 4， and 6kHz) with the speech processor on in the right ear (left ear open) were 74 dB. Four months after the implantation in the left ear， the mean postoperative free-field thresholds deter-mined by behavioral observation audiometry and visual rein-forcement audiometry (average frequency for 0.25，0.5，1，2，4， and 6 kHz) with the speech processor on in the left ear (right ear open) were 63 dB. Intensive auditory training， detection-level listening exercises， and sound differentiation trials have been recommended.\n\n【70】The parents have noted steady progress in their child's audi-tory development.\n\n【71】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

Only whole-exome genetic testing in the patient described allowed the detection of the SLC52A2 mutation， the correct diagnosis， and targeted treat-ment that stopped the progression of the disease. In the study group， the SLC52A2 mutation was detected in 6 patients and the SLC52A3 mutation in 3.\n\n【75】The mainstay of treatment is supplementation with high dos-es of riboflavin (7 to 70 mg/kg daily) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Vitamin B2 therapy not only halts the progression of the disease but also saves the patient’s life - no patient has died during the follow-up period of riboflavin treatment. Before B2 therapy， the disease was considered potentially fatal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Oral riboflavin supplemen-tation should be started with 10 mg/kg/day in 3 doses for 1month， gradually increasing the dosage by 10 mg/kg/day ev-ery month to a target dose of 50 mg/kg daily in 3 doses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【76】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2.

Auditory neuropathy can be both pre-and postsynaptic in nature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Fazio-Londe syndrome， which has an identical basis to BVL， differs from the described syndrome only in the absence of au-ditory symptoms， probably due to the earlier development of the condition and a worse prognosis， which， untreated， typi-cally led to death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，5\\]</u>. The time of onset of deafness to sub-sequent symptoms averages 5 years in males and 11 years in females 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【79】Of the 62 BVVL syndrome type 2 patients reported to date， sensorineural hearing loss has been found in 84% of them. After ataxia， hearing loss is the second most common symp-tom of the syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Treatment of hearing loss in BVVL syndrome depends on the degree of impairment and the stage of the underlying disease. The literature shows an im-provement in the clinical picture and hearing level after ribo-flavin therapy. For example， Foley and colleagues successful-ly treated a patient with a dose of 10 mg/kg/day， which was\n\n【80】increased to 50 mg/kg/day over 12 weeks with evaluation af-ter 3 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. There was a marked improvement in audio-metric tests， from 80 dB at 8 kHz before riboflavin therapy to 40-55 dB at 8 kHz afterwards 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Recently， Carey and col-leagues reported hearing improvement in 3 cases after long term (3-6 months) treatment with riboflavin (1-1.5 g/d)， use of hearing aids， and speech therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>\n\n【81】Mutlu et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u> described the case of a 6-year-old boy with fea-tures of auditory neuropathy， in whom rapid 20-month supple-mentation with very high doses of riboflavin (750-900 mg/d) resulted in an improvement in hearing threshold. Before ther-apy， thresholds in play audiometry showed a profound degree of hearing loss and no benefit from hearing aids； after therapy the speech recognition threshold rose to 30 dB SPL measured by free-field audiometry in a quiet room. With hearing aids， a speech discrimination score of 84% was achieved.\n\n【82】Unfortunately， the effects of therapy are not good in all cas-es. Supplementation often improves the neurological condi-tion of the patient， but the accompanying hearing loss does not regress and hearing aids do not provide much benefit in speech understanding， as shown in Table 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22，26，27-29\\]</u>. In such cases， cochlear implants are the treatment of choice， and the post-device effects are comparable to auditory neuropa-thy from other etiologies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，14，31-33\\]</u>.\n\n【83】The neuropathological basis of hearing loss has been demon-strated by changes， among others， in the auditory pathway(neuronal degeneration in the cochlear nucleus of the brain-stem and astrocytic gliosis in the inferior thalamus). These pa-thologies have been detected in postmortem examinations of the brains of patients with BVVL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，34，35\\]</u>.\n\n【84】Preliminary functional magnetic resonance imaging studies using intermittent toneburst stimulation at 2 kHz in a patient described by Salmina et al suggest that the central auditory pathways remain intact and provide a positive argument for cochlear implantation to restore hearing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>.\n\n【85】The patient's case is compared in Table 1 with case reports of BVVL patients qualified for cochlear implantation available in the literature. In 4 cases， the hearing loss preceded the on-set of the other symptoms of the disease； in our patient， the hearing loss joined the motor symptoms after 5 months and was gradually progressive. An interesting case is described by Gedik at al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>， in whom a sudden deterioration in speech understanding was noted in the patient's first speech audi-ometry and tonal audiometry study， without a deterioration in hearing thresholds. Bilateral profound sensorineural hear-ing loss was noted in all cases， with auditory neuropathy in 6cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，15，17-20\\]</u>.\n\n【86】Hearing aids were tried in all patients， but unfortunately the benefit was limited， or the hearing aids provided no benefit in speech understanding despite supplementation with high dos-es of riboflavin. Our patient did not wear hearing aids perma-nently， (1 hearing aid fitting was performed， without observing the benefit of hearing aids). Eight out of 9 patients decided to have a cochlear implant， and 1 patient decided not to. Our pa-tient's first cochlear implant was implanted about 1 year af-ter the diagnosis of hearing loss， while the average time from the diagnosis of hearing loss to cochlear implantation in the study group was about 11 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，15，17-20\\]</u>.\n\n【87】The post-implantation effects in our patient were evaluated4 and 5 months after implantation，whereas in the other pa-tients this evaluation was performed at between 3 months and5 years. Different methods were used： free-field audiometry， which showed effects at the level of mild to moderate hear-ing loss for frequencies of 2 and 4 kHz in 3 cases described by Anderson et all 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> and 1 case described by Sinnathuray et al通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>， and verbal audiometry using the Bench-Kowal-Bamfort sentence test， which showed effects of 0%， 25%， and 94%， respectively， for the cases described by Menzes et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> and Sinnathuray et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Our patient's post-implantation effects were assessed 4 and 5 months after implantation at the level of progression from profound to moderate hearing loss in the right ear and severe hearing loss in the left ear (averaged for frequencies from 0.25 to 6 kHz， assessed separately for each device). In a free-field test using behavioral observation audi-ometry (BOA) after 5 months after implantation， the average hearing level was 74 dB in the right ear (left ear open). In the left ear， the average hearing level was 63 dB (right ear open)4 months after implantation using behavioral observation au-diometry (BOA) and visual reinforcement audiometry (VRA). The effects of the device after cochlear implantation in the de scribed patient are comparable to the results in patients with auditory neuropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【88】It is difficult to compare of the effects after cochlear implanta-tion in the analyzed group because of the different ages of on-set of hearing loss (pre-，peri-， post-lingual)， the time elapsed between the onset of symptoms and the start of riboflavin therapy and its different dosage， the time of assessment of the effects after implantation， and the use of different meth-ods of assessing the effects after implantation.\n\n【89】Conclusions\n\n【90】This report has highlighted the importance of genetic test-ing in infants who present with atypical symptoms or signs. Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome， despite its extreme rar-ity， should be taken into account during the differential diag-nosis of young patients with progressive auditory neuropathic\n\n【91】symptoms accompanied by ataxia and sternocleidomastoid palsy of unclear etiology. It is then advisable to extend the ge-netic diagnosis to BVVL syndrome.\n\n【92】If Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome is suspected， vitamin B2supplementation should be started immediately， even in the absence of a genetic test result， in order to prevent the possi-ble progression of the disease. Unfortunately， in the vast major-ity of cases， it is not possible to improve the hearing threshold despite the supply of riboflavin， so early therapy is extremely important to preserve the patient's hearing.\n\n【93】In cases of severe or profound hearing loss in BVVL syndrome， especially when the patient does not experience improvement in speech understanding despite the use of hearing aids， the treatment of choice is cochlear implantation. The effects after implantation depend on the stage of the underlying disease， the time of onset of the hearing loss (pre- or postlingual)，and its duration until cochlear implantation， and they are compara-ble to those seen in other postsynaptic auditory neuropathies.\n\n【94】In this case， the diagnosis of Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syn-drome led to timely correction of the genetic riboflavin (vita-min B2) deficiency and improved hearing following cochle-ar implantation.\n\n【95】References：\n\n【96】1\\.

Aneurysm and/or pancreatitis may have a causal relation with hemosuccus pancreaticus (HP). HP causes an obscure bleeding in the digestive tract， and this rare disease may lead to life-threatening condition. Although interven-tional radiology is generally employed as the initial treatment for visceral aneurysms， aneurysmic recanaliza-tion is a critical problem.\n\n【32】Case Reports：\n\n【33】A 58-year-old male was incidentally diagnosed as groove pancreatitis， and his pancreatitis was successfully treated by conservative management. One year later， an IPDA aneurysm was detected in image studies. Gastrointestinal bleeding was objectively observed， and a diagnosis of asymptomatic HP was made. Arterio-pancreatic duct fistula was suspected， but was not identified. Coil embolization was successfully completed. Six months later， he suffered a relapse of HP， and visited our emergency unit. Pseudocystic lesion around metal-lic coils were confirmed. Subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy without any extended resec-tions was performed. Intentional dissections of nerve plexuses and lymph nodes were all waived. Even a pan-creatography of the resected specimen did not clarify his arterio-pancreatic duct fistula. He was discharged at postoperative day 10， and smoothly returned to his work.\n\n【34】Conclusions：\n\n【35】Pancreatic juice-related complications after advanced pancreaticoduodenectomy for malignancies are often in-tractable. However， simple pancreaticoduodenectomy which omits extended resections and intentional dissec-tions is safe and feasible for benign diseases. After the initial interventional radiology for pancreatic aneurysms， an elective pancreatic surgery should be considered to avoid unwanted recanalization and refractory HP.\n\n【36】MeSH Keywords： Aneurysm · General Surgery · Hemorrhage · Pancreaticoduodenectomy•\n\n【37】Pancreatitis · Radiology， Interventional\n\n【38】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/914832\n\n【39】甲品\n\n【40】蓝珀 06 同可27\n\n【41】NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 Intemational (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)\n\n【42】Visceral artery aneurysm is the third most common intra-ab-dominal aneurysm after aneurysms of the aortic and iliac ar-teries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

Here， in this case report， a thought-provoking case of an IPDA aneurysm which appeared after groove pancreatitis and repeated HP even after coil emboliza-tion is reported in detail. We also discuss an indication of sur-gical approach for arterial aneurysm of the pancreatic artery.\n\n【46】A 58-year-old male presented with past history of Mallory-Weiss syndrome， early gastric cancer， and lung adenocarcinoma. Follow-up computed tomography incidentally detected a hypo-vascular soft tissue in the groove area . A diagnosis of groove pancreatitis was made， and thereafter， his pancre-atitis was successfully treated. However， 1 year later， an artery aneurysm (15 mm in size) was detected in the pancreas head， and the IPDA mainly supplied arterial flow into this aneurysm. Iron-deficient anemia and black stool were ob-served， and a diagnosis of HP was made， though endoscopic ex-amination did not clarify active bleeding. Angiographic finding revealed that the patient’s IPDA aneurysm partially communi-cated with the gastroduodenal artery . Obscure APDF was suspected， but was not identified.

Hematochezia was observed. Endoscopic exam-ination showed not active bleeding but vinous duodenal juice. Endoscopic ultrasound  and magnetic resonance imaging  showed a pancreatic pseudo-cyst around metallic coils (22 mm in size). His hidden APDF was not clarified in the endoscopic retrograde pancreatography， and then， an endoscopic nasopancreatic drainage tube was placed . Bloody pancreatic juice was ob-served in the tube discharge. A diagnosis of HP was made.\n\n【50】At approximately 60 years of age， subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (SSpPD) without any extended re-sections was simply performed. Also， intentional dissections of\n\n【51】nerve plexuses and lymph nodes were all waived. Pseudocystic lesion and metallic coils were observed in the pancreas head by intraoperative ultrasound . Dense tissues were observed at the groove area . Operative time was483 minutes. Blood loss was 955 mL， and blood transfusion of red blood cell (280 mL) was required. Nerve plexuses around the SMA， CA， and other arteries (e.g.， the common hepatic ar-tery) were all preserved. The arterial root of the IPDA which branched from the SMA was intact. The IPDA and gastrodu-odenal artery were ligated and then cut at each root， respec-tively . Normal pancreatic parenchyma and duct were confirmed at the pancreatic body by intraoperative ul-trasound ， and the pancreas was cut at the normal portion after a tunneling of the pancreas head .\n\n【52】Inherent reconstructions during SSpPD were done by mod-ified Child's method with Braun’s anastomosis .\n\n【53】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4.

Peri-and intra-pancreatic arteries build a unique pancreatic arcade， and this characteristic flow results in an aneurysmic recanalization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>. Although surgical strat-egies of pancreatic pseudocyst have been established 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>， a pseudocyst itself did not affect a surgical indication in our\n\n【62】case. Contrastingly， a refractory HP even after coil embolization forced us to choose a surgical approach for his IPDA aneurysm.\n\n【63】Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) was first attempted by Codivilla in 1898 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>， and was thereafter successfully performed by Kausch in 1912 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. In 1935， Whipple demonstrated that clas-sical PD was technically feasible and compatible with a rea-sonable function after recovery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.

Parabiliary plexuses were swelled ， and cholangiolitic air (blue arrow) was observed. Fasting and antibiotics were required for 1 week. (D) Advanced SSpPD for pancreatic cancer was performed as a conversion surgery after chemotherapy. According to the tumor extent， the IVC was partially resected， and paraaortic lymph nodes were fully dissected. Intraperitoneal abscess due to pancreatic leakage developed at postoperative day 15. Although local drainage and antibiotics administration were continued， the stump of gastroduodenal artery was suddenly ruptured at postoperative 28. Massive bleeding (red arrow) was observed in an emergent angiography. Owing to intentional dissections of nerve plexuses and lymph nodes， angiographic forms of the CHA and PHA notably became thin and frizzy . Covered stents were placed into the CHA and PHA， and both hepatic arterial flow and complete hemostasis were obtained simultaneo usly.

All PDs inherently require 3 reconstructions： digestive tract， biliary tree， and pancreatic duct. Reconstructive techniques(e.g.， the Whipple， Child， and Imanaga procedures) have been introduced 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，21-24\\]</u>， and have already undergone some\n\n【66】modifications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25，26\\]</u>. Hence， surgical procedures during all PDs have been currently well-established in detail.\n\n【67】A simple question has arisen： Is a PD for pancreatic aneu-rysm and HP risky business? The risk of PD has fallen to 5%\n\n【68】to 10%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25，27\\]</u>， though PD easily causes postoperative compli-cations (e.g.， delayed gastric emptying， gastrointestinal ulcer， postoperative cholangitis， anastomotic leakage， intraperitoneal abscess， intractable pancreatic fistula， pseudoaneurysm， and massive bleeding). Actual findings of typical complications after advanced SSpPDs with extended resections of vessels and sur-rounding organs and/or intentional dissections of nerve plex-uses and lymph nodes were summarized in Figure 6. Especially， pancreatic juice-related complications (i.e.， pancreatic leakage and subsequent fistula) after advanced PDs have refractory symptoms， and these intractable complications may result in fatal outcomes (e.g.， septic state and aneurysm rupture).\n\n【69】Even after a coil embolization of the pancreatic artery， peri-and intra-pancreatic arteries will build a unique pancreatic arcade which causes an aneurysmic recanalization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>. Moreover， a refractory HP may be fatal. After the initial interventional ra-diology for pancreatic aneurysms， an elective pancreatic sur-gery should be considered to avoid unwanted recanalization and refractory HP.\n\n【70】References：\n\n【71】1\\.

Fortunately， corneal blindness is fully reversible with a corneal transplant. Corneal transplant is the most frequently performed transplant surgery worldwide and the most successful human organ transplant. Corneal transplantation is an effective treatment option for many patients with corneal disease. Unfortunately， a major limiting factor in performing corneal transplants is the availability of donor tissue. The aim of the study was to assess the knowledge， attitude，and practices of the general population regarding corneal donation in the Aseer region， southern Saudi Arabia. Methodology：A descriptive cross-sectional approach was used targeting all populations in the Aseer region. The study was conducted from December 2019 to March 2020. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire developed by the researchers. The questionnaire data included a person's socio-demographic data. Participants’ awareness regarding corneal donation was assessed using 9 questions on three domains. The participant’s practice and attitude regarding organ donation were also assessed within the questionnaire. Results： A total of 1016 participants were included in the survey whose ages ranged from 18 to 55 years old. Females were 590 (58.1%) of the survey respondents. The exact 490 participants heard about corneal donation (48.2%). About 53% of the participants refused that a living person could donate his eyes. Good awareness level regarding corneal donation was recorded for less than one-quarter of the participants. Considering participants' attitude towards corneal donation ， 390 (38.4%) of the participants recorded their tendency to donate their eyes after death. Conclusions & recommendations： In conclusion， corneal donation awareness is very low worldwide and Saudi Arabia. Participants' awareness level and attitude were unsatisfactory. The barriers recorded were factors related to lack of knowledge and religious related or fatwa.\n\n【5】KEYWORDS Corneal donation， transplantation， population， awareness， practice， attitude， determinants\n\n【6】DOI： 10.5455/IJMRCR.GeneralPopulationregardingCornealDonation\n\n【7】First Received： December 18，2021\n\n【8】Accepted： January 4， 2022\n\n【9】Associate Editor： Ivan Inkov (BG)；\n\n【10】1Corresponding author： Rishi K.

The study was conducted during the period from December 2019 to March 2020. A total of 1016participants were included in the survey whose ages ranged from 18 to 55 years old， and blind people were excluded from the study. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire developed by the researchers after intensive literature review and expert's consultation. The questionnaire data included per-son's socio-demographic data such as age， gender， education， residence， and job. Participants' awareness regarding corneal donation was assessed using 9 questions covering hearing about corneal donation，indications of donation， circumstances for do-nation donated eye parts， and duration till donation after death. The participants' attitudes and practices regarding organ dona-tion were also covered in the questionnaire. A panel of 3 experts reviewed the questionnaire independently for content validity， and all suggested modifications were applied till the final tool was achieved. The questionnaire was uploaded online using social media platforms by the researchers and their relatives and friends to fill all populations in the Aseer region. A pilot study was conducted to assess tool applicability and reliability. The tool reliability coefficient (Alpha Cronbach's) was assessed and equalled 0.76.\n\n【17】Data analysis\n\n【18】After data were extracted， it was revised， coded and fed to sta-tistical software IBM SPSS version 22 (SPSS， Inc. Chicago， IL). All statistical analysis was done using two-tailed tests. P-value\n\n【19】less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. For awareness items， each correct answer was scored one point， and the total summation of the discrete scores of the different items was calculated. A person with a score less than 60% (6 points) of the maximum score was considered to have poor awareness， while good awareness was considered if he had a score of 60% (6points or more) of the maximum or more. Descriptive analysis based on frequency and percent distribution was done for all variables， including demographic data， awareness items and personal attitude. Cross tabulation was used to assess the dis-tribution of awareness according to participants' personal and family history data. Relations were tested using Pearson chi-square or exact tests.\n\n【20】Results\n\n【21】One thousand sixteen participants were included in the survey whose ages ranged from 18 to 55 years old. Females were 590(58.1%) of the survey respondents. The exact 863 of the respon-dents were from urban areas (82.3%)， and 484 (47.6%) were sin-gle， and 478 (47%) were married. Considering educational level，750 (73.8%) of the participants were university graduated， and616(60.6%) were non-healthcare workers. Monthly income less than 5000 SR was recorded for 520 (51.2%) of the survey partici-pants (table1). Table 2 demonstrates the population awareness regarding corneal donation. The exact 490 participants heard about corneal donation (48.2%). About 53% of the participants refused that a living person could donate his eyes. The exact338 (33.3%) of the participants told that anyone irrespective of age could donate cornea after death， while 45.7% of them do not know who can donate cornea. As for parts of them that can be donated， the majority of the respondents recorded cornea(55.3%；562)， followed by the lens (16.9%；172)， retina (14.8%；150)， while 37.2% of the sample did not know. On asking about the optimal time to retrieve the eye after the death of a person，284 (28%) of the participants told for 0-6 hours， 15.2% recorded6-24 hours， while 48% did not know. An exact 246 (24.2%) of the participants agreed that donated eyes could cure all types of blindness. Also， 314 (30.9%) of the participants said that blood group mismatch prevents corneal donation. Regarding partic-ipants'knowledge of where and how to apply if they wanted to register for corneal donation， it was recorded for 116 partic-ipants (11.4%). Sixty-six(6.5%) of the participants believe that they have enough knowledge of cornea donation. In total， a Good awareness level regarding corneal donation was recorded for 176 participants (17.3%).\n\n【22】Considering participants' attitude towards corneal donation， 390 (38.4%) of the participants recorded their tendency to donate their eyes after death. Among those who refused， lack of knowledge regarding corneal donation was the most recorded barrier (42.2%；164)， followed by religious beliefs (19.8%；124) and disturbed appearance of the body (16.6%；104).\n\n【23】Table 4 illustrates the distribution of population awareness by their data and attitude. Good awareness level was recorded among 20.7% of male participants compared to 14.9% of females with recorded statistical significance (P=.017). Also， 28.6% of young age participants had a good awareness level compared to 18.2% of those above 60 years (P=.005). The exact 18.7% of participants from urban areas had a good awareness level com-pared to 11.1% at rural residences (P=.015). Health care workers recorded significantly higher awareness levels than others (25%vs. 12.3%) with statistical significance (P=.001). Also， 66.7% of those who believe that they had good information regarding\n\n【24】Table 1 Personal data of survey participants’ in Aseer region.\n\n| Personal data  |  | No  | %  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gender  | Male  | 426  | 41.9%  |\n|  | Female  | 590  | 58.1%  |\n| Age in years  | <20 years  | 14  | 1.4%  |\n|  | 20-29  | 508  | 50.0%  |\n|  | 30-39  | 218  | 21.5%  |\n|  | 40-49  | 188  | 18.5%  |\n|  | 50+  | 88  | 8.7%  |\n| Residence  | Urban  | 836  | 82.3%  |\n|  | Rural  | 180  | 17.7%  |\n| Marital status  | Single  | 484  | 47.6%  |\n|  | Married  | 478  | 47.0%  |\n|  | Divorced  | 40  | 3.9%  |\n|  | Widow  | 14  | 1.4%  |\n| Educational level  | Primary school  | 8  | 8%  |\n|  | Intermediate school  | 24  | 2.4%  |\n|  | High school  | 152  | 15.0%  |\n|  | College  | 750  | 73.8%  |\n|  | Post graduate  | 82  | 8.1%  |\n| Work status  | Health care worker  | 400  | 39.4%  |\n|  | Non-health care worker  | 616  | 60.6%  |\n| Monthly income  | ≤5000 SR  | 520  | 51.2%  |\n|  | 5000-15000 SR  | 330  | 32.5%  |\n|  | \\>15000 SR  | 166  | 16.3%  |\n\n【26】Table 2 Population awareness regarding corneal donation in Aseer region， Saudi Arabia\n\n| Awareness regarding corneal donation  |  | No  | %  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Heard about eye donation  | Yes  | 490  | 48.2%  |\n|  | No  | 466  | 45.9%  |\n|  | Don't know  | 60  | 5.9%  |\n| Living person can donate his eyes  | Yes  | 230  | 22.6%  |\n|  | No  | 536  | 52.8%  |\n|  | Don'tkrow  | 250  | 24.6%  |\n| Who can donate eyes  | Any one irrespective ofage after death  | 338  | 33.3%  |\n|  | Those who have not undergone cataract  | 30  | 3.0%  |\n|  | surgery  |  |  |\n|  | Those who don't wear spectacles  | 20  | 2.0%  |\n|  | Only those below the age of 50 years  | 46  | 4.5%  |\n|  | Those without history ofany chronic illness  | 118  | 11.6%  |\n|  | I don't know  | 464  | 45.7%  |\n| Part of the eye that can be donated  | Cornea  | 562  | 55.3%  |\n|  | Iris  | 96  | 9.4%  |\n|  | Pupil  | 82  | 8.1%  |\n|  | Lens  | 172  | 16.9%  |\n|  | Retina  | 150  | 14.8%  |\n|  | I don't know  | 378  | 37.2%  |\n| Optimal time to retrieve the eye after the death of person  | 0-6 hours  | 284  | 28.0%  |\n|  | 6-24 hours  | 154  | 15.2%  |\n|  | Even after 24 hours  | 90  | 8.9%  |\n|  | I don't know  | 488  | 48.0%  |\n| Can donated eyes cure all types of blindness  | Yes  | 246  | 24.2%  |\n|  | No  | 180  | 17.7%  |\n|  | I don't know  | 590  | 58.1%  |\n| Blood group mismatch prevents corneal donation  | Yes  | 314  | 30.9%  |\n|  | No  | 280  | 27.6%  |\n|  | I don't know  | 422  | 41.5%  |\n| Know where and how to apply if you wanted to register for corneal donation  | Yes  | 116  | 11.4%  |\n| Know where and how to apply if you wanted to register for corneal donation  | No  | 900  | 88.6%  |\n| Know where and how to apply if you wanted to register for corneal donation  | Poor Good  |  |  |\n| Believe that you have enough knowledge on cornea donation  | Yes  | 66  | 6.5%  |\n| Believe that you have enough knowledge on cornea donation  | No  | 950  | 93.5%  |\n\n【28】Overall awareness level\n\n【29】840 (82.7%)176(17.3%)\n\n| Attitude towards organ donation  | No  | %  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Will you donate your eyes after death  |  |  |\n| Yes  | 390  | 38.4%  |\n| No  | 626  | 61.6%  |\n| If the answer is No， Why don’t you want to donate your eyes  |  |  |\n| I don't have time  | 36  | 5.8%  |\n| Religious beliefs  | 124  | 19.8%  |\n| don't have enough knowledge about corneal donation  | 264  | 42.2%  |\n| It disturbs normal appenrance of the body after death  | 104  | 16.6%  |\n| Fear  | 24  | 3.8%  |\n| Personal opinion  | 16  | 2.6%  |\n| Family restriction  | 58  | 9.3%  |\n\n【31】organ donation recorded a high awareness level compared to13.9% of those who did not (P=.001).\n\n【32】Discussion\n\n【33】Globally， corneal blindness is the second most recorded ocular disorder， especially in developing countries. About 4.9 million individuals have bilateral corneal blindness， while 23 million are unilaterally blind. This leads to a significant health burden and reduction in quality of life.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> The burden of corneal dis-eases (such as keratoconus and bullous keratopathy) in Saudi Arabia is a significant concern. In Aseer province alone， a young population (aged 8-28 years) was found to have early onset ker-atoconus with quick progression to the severe stage of the con-dition with an estimated incidence of 20 new cases per 100，000population.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>\n\n【34】The current study aimed to assess the general population awareness regarding corneal donation in the Aseer region， south-ern Saudi Arabia. The study revealed that the population had a poor awareness level， and the majority of the participants did not know about corneal donation. One of the surprising findings was that nearly one-quarter of the participants think that living persons can donate cornea. At most awareness items， nearly half of the participants recorded do not know their answer，which means that they do not hear about corneal donation. The higher awareness was recorded among male participants at a young age and health care workers. Participants with lower educa-tional levels insignificantly were more knowledgeable regarding corneal donation than those who were university graduates or more. This finding may need more explanation which is against the trend.\n\n【35】Regarding participants' attitude towards corneal donation， one-third of them reported their willingness to donate their cornea after death which is mostly those who are knowledge-able. For those who refused the idea， lack of knowledge re-garding corneal donation was the most recorded cause besides religious beliefs. Williams AM et al.， 2019通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> conducted a cross-sectional study to understand awareness and attitudes about corneal donation worldwide from 55 published studies across13 countries. Awareness of corneal donation in the included studies ranged from 8.4% among eye patients in Ghana to 100%\n\n【36】among a sample of medical students in India，14，44 averaging71% across all included studies. Willingness to donate ranged from 7.3% among surveyed urban Pakistanis to 90% of patients at a tertiary eye institute in the United States，55，61 averaging52% across all studies. Lartey S et al. conducted a cross-sectional survey to assess awareness and attitudes toward corneal dona-tion among applicants and staff of a driver， vehicle and licensing authority (DVLA) in Ghana.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> the study revealed that 32.7%of the participants were aware of corneal donation. Also， 67.3%were willing to donate their corneas after death.\n\n【37】Regionally in Saudi Arabia， attitude， beliefs and awareness towards corneal donation was studied by Alanazi LF et al.，2019.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> The researchers found that of the 1292 respondents， only 4.3% believed that they had sufficient knowledge about corneal donation； 66.3% of the sample had not decided whether to donate their corneas after death； 40.2% reported that they would be more willing to donate if they had sufficient knowl-edge about corneal donation， and 46.1% of the population did not know where to apply to donate their corneas. Those who believed that they had sufficient information about corneal do-nation were significantly more likely to donate. A second study was conducted by Bugis A et al.， 2018 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u> to assess the knowl-edge and attitudes of the Saudi population regarding eye dona-tion and corneal transplants. The study findings were that only2.9% of the participants had good knowledge regarding corneal donation. About religion， 96.3% knew that eye donation is not against religious beliefs. Only 7% were aware that Saudi Arabia maintains eye banks. About 61.5% agreed to donate their eyes， and 23.3% agreed to donate the eyes of their relatives after their deaths. The most commonly recorded reasons for not being a potential donor was lack of awareness about eye donation and not knowing how to pledge one’s eyes for donation after death. This indicates incredible potential for significant increase in the number of registered eye potential donors worldwide through educational campaigns.\n\n【38】Conclusions and recommendations\n\n【39】In conclusion， the study revealed that the population in the Aseer region were poorly knowledgeable regarding corneal do-nation and its circumstances which was the main barrier against\n\n【40】Table 4 Distribution of population awareness by their personal data and attitude.\n\n【41】Factors\n\n【42】Awareness level P-value\n\n|  |  | Poor  |  | Good  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  | No  | %  | No  | %  |  |\n| Gender  | Male  | 338  | 79.3%  | 88  | 20.7%  | 017\\  |\n|  | Female  | 502  | 85.1%  | 88  | 14.9%  |  |\n| Age in years  | <18 years  | 10  | 71.4%  | 4  | 28.6%  | .005\\  |\n|  | 18-29  | 404  | 79.5%  | 104  | 20.5%  |  |\n|  | 30-39  | 198  | 90.8%  | 20  | 9.2%  |  |\n|  | 40-49  | 156  | 83.0%  | 32  | 17.0%  |  |\n|  | 50+  | 72  | 81.8%  | 16  | 18.2%  |  |\n| Residence  | Urban  | 680  | 81.3%  | 156  | 18.7%  | .015\\  |\n|  | Rural  | 160  | 88.9%  | 20  | 11.1%  |  |\n| Marital status  | Single  | 382  | 78.9%  | 102  | 21.1%  | .089  |\n|  | Married  | 410  | 85.8%  | 68  | 14.2%  |  |\n|  | Divorced  | 34  | 85.0%  | 6  | 15.0%  |  |\n|  | Widow  | 14  | 100.0%  | 0  | 0.0%  |  |\n| Educational level  | Primary school  | 6  | 75.0%  | 2  | 25.0%  | 546  |\n|  | Intermediate school  | 20  | 83.3%  | 4  | 16.7%  |  |\n|  | High school  | 120  | 78.9%  | 32  | 21.1%  |  |\n|  | College  | 694  | 83.4%  | 138  | 16.6%  |  |\n| Work status  | Health care worker  | 300  | 75.0%  | 100  | 25.0%  | .001\\  |\n|  | Non-health care worker  | 540  | 87.7%  | 76  | 12.3%  |  |\n| Monthly income  | ≤5000 SR  | 426  | 81.9%  | 94  | 18.1%  | .001\\  |\n|  | 5000-15000 SR  | 296  | 89.7%  | 34  | 10.3%  |  |\n|  | ≥15000 SR  | 118  | 71.1%  | 48  | 28.9%  |  |\n| Believe that you have enough knowledge on cornea donation  | Yes  | 22  | 33.3%  | 44  | 66.7%  | .001\\  |\n|  | No  | 818  | 86.1%  | 132  | 13.9%  |  |\n| Will you donate your eyes after death  | Yes  | 294  | 75.4%  | 96  | 24.6%  | .001\\  |\n|  | No  | 546  | 87.2%  | 80  | 12.8%  |  |\n\n【44】P： Pearson X test\n\n【45】\\P < 0.05 (significant)\n\n【46】their willingness to be potential donor.

It presents as acute non-traumatic swelling and pain of the lower extremity， which can mimic deep vein throm-bosis (DVT). The clinical course is usually self-limiting and patients respond well to supportive medical therapy. A 54-year-old male with past medical history of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus typell， hyperlipidemia， gas-troesophageal reflux disease (GERD)， and remote history of DVT presented to our emergency department with2-week history of progressively worsening left calf pain and swelling. On physical examination， the patient had increased warmth， edema， erythema， and tenderness in the left calf， with positive Homan’s sign. A low-er-extremity venous Doppler was negative for DVT. His creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) level was normal， but hemoglobin A1C was 11.0%， reflective of poor glycemic control. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left calf revealed a focus of non-enhancement in the gastrocnemius muscle along with increased enhancement of\n\n【20】the rest of the muscle， suggestive of diabetic myonecrosis.\n\n【21】Conclusions：\n\n【22】Diabetic myonecrosis is a rare complication of long-standing diabetes mellitus that can often mimic DVT. Diagnosis can be made on an MRl， and treatment involves strict glycemic control along with antiplatelet ther-apy and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs).\n\n【23】MeSH Keywords： Diabetes Mellitus · Magnetic Resonance Imaging·Muscle， Skeletal· Necrosis·\n\n【24】Ultrasonography， Doppler， Color\n\n【25】Full-text PDF http：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/900903\n\n【26】Diabetic myonecrosis is an uncommon complication of diabe tes mellitus that occurs in patients with long-standing poorly controlled diabetes. Angervall and Stener first reported it in1965 as focal muscular degeneration in 2 diabetic patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Since then， more than 100 cases have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It is also known as spontaneous diabetic muscle infarction and can occur in patients with either type l or type Il diabetes.Although the pathogenesis of this disease is unclear， it is thought to be secondary to diabetic microangiopathy. Due to the rarity of this disease， it is often under-diagnosed or under-reported， resulting in unnecessary testing and delay in diagnosis. We present the case of a patient with left calf pain secondary to diabetic myonecrosis， mimicking deep vein thrombosis (DVT).\n\n【27】Case Report\n\n【28】A 54-year-old white male with past medical history of diabe-tes mellitus type ll， hyperlipidemia，GERD， and remote history of DVT (about 15 years ago) presented to our emergency de-partment with complaints of left calf pain and swelling. He not-ed swelling in his left calf about 2 weeks prior to admission， associated with calf pain while walking. He denied any recent surgery， prolonged immobilization， or trauma to his leg. He de-nied any other systemic complaints. His past medical history\n\n【29】was significant for long-standing poorly controlled diabetes mellitus type ll complicated by diabetic neuropathy， without any evidence of nephropathy or retinopathy. He also report-ed having a DVT about 15 years ago for which he was treat-ed with warfarin for 6 months and did not have any recurrent episode of DVT. Additionally， he reported having GERD and hy-perlipidemia. His home medications included insulin glargine50 units daily， gemfibrozil 600 mg 3 times a day， Glyburide-Metformin 2.5 mg- 500 mg twice a day， aspirin 81 mg daily， pantoprazole 40 mg daily， atorvastatin 80 mg daily， and gaba-pentin 300 mg 3 times a day. The patient reported taking the above medications，but the medication compliance was ques-tioned given his elevated hemoglobin A1C level.\n\n【30】The patient's vital signs on admission were within normal lim-its. On physical examination， he was noted to have increased warmth， edema， and tenderness in his left calf， with positive Homan's sign. His foot was warm to touch， with 3+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses in both feet， which ruled out any signs of arterial occlusion or compartment syndrome. His laboratory studies， including complete blood count and com-prehensive metabolic panel， were unremarkable， except for hy-perglycemia with blood glucose level of 273 mg/dL on admis-sion. The hemoglobin A1C was noted to be elevated at 11.0%， reflective of poor glycemic control. His C-reactive protein (CRP) was slightly elevated at 12.9 mg/L， but his creatinine phos-phokinase (CPK) level was normal at 44 U/L. He underwent a\n\n【31】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

He also underwent an X-ray of the left leg ， which was nega-tive for any fracture， but it did show soft tissue swelling of the calf and a small focus of increased density suggestive of dys-trophic soft tissue mineralization. Given the negative venous Doppler and suspicious X-ray findings， he underwent an MRI of the calf with contrast. The MRI showed a 4.7x2.1×1.6 cm focus of non-enhancement in the inferior medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle and edema-like signal changes with enhancement of the rest of the gastrocnemius and extensor digitorum longus muscle， suggestive of diabetic myonecrosis. Surgical consultation occurred and a general sur-geon evaluated the patient， recommending conservative treat-ment instead of surgery because there were no signs of sep-sis or compartment syndrome. The patient was continued on low-dose aspirin and was started on I ketorolac 30 mg ev-ery 6 hours as anti-inflammatory and pain control， which re-sulted in modest improvement in the calf pain and swelling over the next 2-3 days while he was in the hospital. He was started on insulin glargine， prandial lispro， and sliding scale for strict glycemic control. His repeat laboratory work-up was unchanged. He was subsequently discharged home on met-formin， glipizide， Lantus， low-dose aspirin， and oral ketorolac with outpatient follow-up.\n\n【34】Diabetic muscle infarction， otherwise known as diabetic myo-necrosis， is a rare complication of diabetes mellitus that occurs in patients with long-standing diabetes (usually>15 years) and often along with other microvascular complications such as retinopathy，nephropathy， or neuropathy. It is more common in type I diabetics but can also occur in patients with type ll diabetes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Patients often present with acute-onset unilater-al muscle pain， tenderness， and swelling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Bilateral involve-ment can occur and has been previously reported， but it is rare. The most commonly affected muscle group is the thigh mus-cles (71.2%)， including the quadriceps， hip adductors， ham-strings， and hip flexors， with calf muscles (15.3%) being the second most common site involved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>. Although neuropa-thy is frequently seen in patients with long-standing diabetes mellitus such as our patient， there is no clear evidence at this time suggesting that neuropathy increases the risk of devel-oping diabetic myonecrosis.\n\n【35】The pathophysiology of diabetic myonecrosis is not fully un-derstood； however， severa. theories have been put forth， in-cluding arteriosclerosis， microangiopathy， ischemia-reperfu-sion injury， and an alteration in the coagulation-fibrinolysis system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. Chester and Banker suggested an atheroem-bolic phenomenon， but the results of their study were more consistent with arteriosclerosis obliterans， which at this time\n\n【36】appears to be the most widely accepted hypothesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.Others proposed theories include alterations in the coagulation path-way (with increased factor VII activity and increased level of plasminogen activator inhibitor) as well as the presence of phospholipid antibodies as possible etiologies for myonecro sis， but more research is needed this field to establish a de-finitive cause 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>.\n\n【37】Diagnosis of diabetic myonecrosis begins with a strong clini-cal suspicion of the disease. Most common differential diag-noses include DVT， cellulitis， hematoma， abscess， pyomyositis， fasciitis， and malignancy. Laboratory testing， including leuko-cyte count， CPK， and inflammatory markers， are non-specific as they can be elevated or normal in patients with diabetic myo-necrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The test of choice is MRl， with and without con-trast， of the muscle group involved， which is highly sensitive in diagnosis of this disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，12\\]</u>. Typical MRI findings include loss of intermuscular septae (most easily seen on T1-weighted images) and diffuse enlargement of the involved muscle， with subcutaneous edema (best visualized on T2-weighted images as hyperintensity of the involved muscle compared with unaf-fected muscle and fat) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. MRl images show diffuse enhance-ment of the affected muscle， which represents edema and in-flammation， and a focal area of low intensity signal suggestive of muscle necrosis or infarction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Although muscle biopsy is the criterion standard for diagnosing diabetic myonecrosis， it is reserved for atypical patients when clinical or radiolog-ic findings are not suggestive， due to the poor wound healing and high risk of infection associated with muscle biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【38】References：\n\n【39】1\\.

These injuries are commonly sustained during industrial and farming accidents in which a large rotational force avulses the skin and subcutaneous tissue from the underlying fascia. Even though such injuries usually are not lethal but these are associated with morbidities and are devastating to the patients psychologically if not treated properly. Staged reconstruction with flaps or skin grafts or a combination of both is the main modalities described for treating such injuries to get satisfactory aesthetic results with normal voiding function and erection of the penis.\n\n【3】KEYWORDS Degloving， Injury， reconstruction， graft， flap\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Abdominoperineal injuries occur mainly due to harvesting ma-chines in the agriculture field， industrial machines such as pul-leys， chains and rotary discs when they catch the operators clothes and pull out the skin of the genitalia.

Multiple surgical options have been used for the closure of major scrotal wounds.\n\n【11】Case report\n\n【12】A 42-year-old male was referred to our centre from a primary health centre as a case of farming machine injury involving the abdominoperineal region. While working， he had got his clothes entangled in a harvesting machine while operating it. After ruling out any life-threatening injury and after stabilization of the patient， a clinical assessment of the injury was performed. On examination， the skin of penis，scrotum and lower abdominal wall up to umbilicus was completely torn off， with amputation of left testis involving the spermatic cord and complete exposure of right testis and entire shaft of the penis. The whole scrotum was missing. The spermatic cord only connected the right testis and epididymis. The patient was catheterized. Tetanus prophylaxis and broad-spectrum antibiotics were started. The patient was optimised and prepared for surgery.\n\n【13】The patient was operated in a supine position under general anaesthesia with endotracheal intubation. Debridement of the devitalized tissue followed by jet saline irrigation of the wound was done. Complete haemostasis was achieved. A subcutaneous pouch was created， and the right testis was placed inside the pouch in proper alignment and anchoring sutured applied. The split-thickness skin graft was harvested from the left thigh， the graft meshed (1：2)， and the raw area was grafting involving the\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1： Image showing the degloving injury involving lower anterior abdominal wall and perineum.</u>\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2： Image showing placement of the right testis in the subcutaneous pouch created on medial aspect of thigh.</u>\n\n【16】phallus. The wound in the perineum was closed primarily， and a glove drain was put in. Tie-over non-adherent dressing was done. The Frist dressing was done on 3rd post-operative day， and the drain was removed. Patient discharged after 2nd dress-ing after removal of the urinary catheter on 6th post-operative day. The graft take was excellent， and there was no hematoma or any signs of infection.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】Slack in 1952 described the nature of this injury as a form of torsional injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The mechanism involves large rotational forces such as a spinning tire causing traumatic avulsion of the skin and subcutaneous tissue from underlying musculoskeletal structures. The penis is covered by loose and elastic skin. As the penile skin is highly mobile to accommodate both the rigid and flaccid state of the penis， this loose base predisposes the skin to be torn off easily from the penis. From simple lacerations to virtual emasculations， avulsions vary in the spectrum.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>How-ever， due to the relative isolation and mobility of the genitals，\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】Invariably these injuries are seen in people who are wearing loose clothing over the lower half while operating machines； therefore， public awareness and ensuring strict adherence to workplace safety regulations will prevent these machine injuries to a great extent. Besides， all possible techniques of the recon-struction should be known to the surgeon to achieve optimal recovery.\n\n【21】Funding\n\n【22】This work did not receive any grant from funding agencies in the public， commercial， or not-for-profit sectors.\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of interest</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There are no conflicts of interest to declare by any of the authors of this study.</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>References</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

Its formation is associated with local dis-ruption of the pancreatic duct or pseudocyst communicating with the ductal system. Rarely， other intrathoracic complications may develop such as mediastinitis， pericarditis， hemothorax， and pleural empyema. The combi-nation of pancreaticopleural fistula with lung abscesses is extremely rare.\n\n【22】Case Report：\n\n【23】A 37-year-old male patient， a long-term alcohol abuser， was admitted with complaints on left thoracic and up-per abdominal pain， fever with a body temperature of 39.1C， and a severe cough with purulent sputum. Left-sided pneumonia with pleural effusion was diagnosed. Thoracentesis and then a pleural drainage were per-formed. However， the symptoms persisted. Pleural effusion amylase was very high- more than 60 000 IU/L. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed cystic changes in the pancreatic head，pseudo-cyst in the pancreatic body， dilation of the Wirsung duct， and pancreaticopleural fistula with several left lung abscesses. Step by step， the patient underwent drainage of lung abscesses， external drainage of the pancre-atic pseudocyst， and external-internal stenting of the pancreatic duct under ultrasound guidance. After fistula resolution， the patient was readmitted and successfully underwent the Bern variant of the Beger procedure. Six months later， he had no complaints and returned to work. In a follow-up examination， there was no fistula， no ductal hypertension， and only small pulmonary residual changes\n\n【24】Conclusions： A very rare case of chronic pancreatitis complicated by pancreaticopleural fistula with lung abscesses is pre-sented. The clinical outcome was good due to the staged character of treatment and participation of a multi-disciplinary specialist team.\n\n【25】MeSH Keywords： Lung Abscess · Pancreatic Fistula · Pancreatitis， Chronic\n\n【26】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/922195\n\n【27】目国：3\n\n【28】Pancreaticopleural fistula (PPF) is a rare complication of chronic pancreatitis (CP) that develops in 0.4% of patients with pan-creatitis and 4.5% of patients with pancreatic pseudocysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. PPF formation is related to local disruption of the pancreatic duct or pseudocyst connected with the ductal system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. If the pancreatic duct disruption is posterior into the retro-peritoneum， it will track along the path of least resistance， namely up into the mediastinum along the aorta or esopha-gus. The pancreatic juice enters the chest and breaks through one or both pleura(e) and forms - on the background of neg-ative intrathoracic pressure- chronic pancreatic pleural effu-sion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. In very rare cases， due to enzymatic injury of fixed lung tissue， a pancreaticobronchial fistula (PBF) can occur 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>.\n\n【29】However， the intrathoracic complications of PPF are not lim-ited to enzymatic pleural effusions and PBF. Pathologic con-ditions such as hemoptysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-8\\]</u>， hemothorax通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9-11\\]</u>， pleural empyema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，12-18\\]</u>， mediastinitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19，20\\]</u>， pericarditis， and pericardial tamponade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21-24\\]</u> are described in the literature. The pathogenesis of most of these complications probably in-volves a synergetic effect of 2 aggressive factors： enzymatic tissue damage and infection.\n\n【30】PPF itself is a rare condition， and the complications aforemen-tioned are even more rare (each of them is described in only a few publications). Therefore， the management of these intra-thoracic complications of PPF is not well developed.\n\n【31】We have treated 17 patients with CP complicated by PPF， which represents one of the largest institutional series. Here， we present for the first time a case report of PPF complicated by (or combined with) lung abscesses.\n\n【32】Case Report\n\n【33】A 37-year-old Russian male patient was urgently admitted to Nikolayevsky Hospital on July 03，2018. He complained of pain in left hemithorax and left upper abdomen， fever with a body temperature of 39.1℃， and severe cough with purulent green-ish sputum. He became ill 7 days before admission to the hos-pital. Mild pain appeared in the left hypochondrium， and after 3to 4 days a cough and shortness of breath added to his symp-toms and increased with time. For more than 15 years， he was an alcohol abuser and tobacco smoker. During the last 2 years， he complained of periodic upper abdominal pain. He had short-ness of breath and was unable to remain in a prone position due to increased dyspnea and cough with increased sputum volume. Vital signs at the time of admission were as follows： blood pres-sure of 140/90 mmHg， heart rate of 98 beats per minute， tem-perature of 38.2C，and respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute.\n\n【34】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1. Chest radiography at admission that demonstrates massive left-sided pleural effusion.</u>\n\n【35】Auscultation revealed absent breath sound in the lower half and reduced breath sounds with wheezing under the upper half of the left hemithorax. Laboratory tests showed hemo-globin， 12.5 g/dL， white blood cells， 16 800/mm， and plate-lets， 590 000/mm3. Blood chemistry showed elevated serum amylase (3684IU/L)， lipase (1754 IU/L) and C-reactive protein(150.1 g/L). Immunological tests were found to be positive for hepatitis C and negative for human immunodeficiency virus(HⅣ). The remaining laboratory parameters were unremarkable.\n\n【36】Chest radiograph showed left pleural effusion that reached the level of the third rib . Abdominal ultrasound revealed structural changes of the pancreas (diffuse parenchymal hetero-geneity， small calcifications， irregular contours) without its en-largement. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed chronic gastric and duodenal inflammation. The patient was diagnosed with left-sided pneumonia complicated by pleural effusion，com-bining with the acute onset of chronic alcoholic pancreatitis. At thoracentesis， approximately 4.5 L of a brownish， turbid fluid was evacuated. Antibiotic treatment (cefotaxime 1 g twice dai-ly and metronidazole 400 mg 3 times daily) with analgesics and intravenous hydration was commenced. Pleural fluid and spu-tum cultures showed no bacterial growth. Subsequently， we ex-amined the sputum one more time， and the result of the spu-tum culture was again negative. In addition， sputum analysis for mycobacterium tuberculosis was also negative. Thus， the choice of antibiotic therapy in this case was purely empirical but took into account the recommendations of the clinical pharmacolo-gist. Repeated chest radiographs showed infiltration in the left lower lobe and persisting pleural effusion. On abdominal com-puted tomography (CT) scans， cystic changes of the pancreatic head and body and fluid in the subhepatic space were present.\n\n【37】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2. Chest examinations that show the lung abscesses： radiography， lateral (A) and frontal (B) view， abscesses marked by arrows； CT scan (C). A huge abscess is marked by the oval.</u>\n\n【38】Despite treatment， including repeated thoracenteses， the pa-tient did not substantially improve. Antibiotic treatment scheme was changed to pefloxacin (400 mg twice daily). On repeated x-rays， there were 2 left lung abscesses with gas-fluid levels. Due to fluid reaccumulation， the left pleural cavity was drained. At this stage， a measurement of the pleu-ral fluid enzymes was undertaken， showing very high concen-trations (amylase was approximately 60 200 IU/L， lipase could not be precisely measured due to a very high concentration)， and PPF was suspected. Abdominal magnetic resonance im-aging (MRI) revealed a slightly dilated (5 to 6 mm) pancreat-ic duct， cystic transformation of the pancreatic head， and a pseudocyst (53x71 mm) in the body of the gland. Considering the complicated CP and rarity of a clinical situation (combina-tion of PPF and lung abscesses)， the patient was transferred to Mariinsky Hospita! (the main clinical location of our aca-demic departments) on August 05， 2018. As earlier， he had dyspnea， cough with purulent sputum， fever， and was able to sleep only in a sitting position.\n\n【39】Chest CT showed multiple left lung abscesses； the largest one was 10x8 cm .\n\n【40】After multidisciplinary discussion， it was decided that the pa-tient's treatment should be staged and as minimally inva-sive as possible.\n\n【41】During the first stage， 2 lung abscesses were drained under radiologic guidance on August 08， 2018. Additional abscess cavity was drained 2 days later. To decrease pancreatic duc-tal hypertension， the pancreatic body pseudocyst was exter-nally drained under ultrasound navigation on August 08， 2018. The amylase level in pseudocyst fluid was 13 200 IU/L.\n\n【42】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3. Puncture pancreatography at the time of pancreatic duct stenting procedure. Pancreatic duct stricture(large arrow) and pancreatic fistulous track  are clearly seen.</u>\n\n【43】Later， the patient's condition slowly improved. However， the fluid outflow from pseudocyst drain (approximately 100 mL daily) as well as from pleural drains remained stable.\n\n【44】To accelerate the PPF healing， it was decided to perform stent-ing of the pancreatic duct. Transcutaneous external-internal stenting with 14 Fr pancreatic stent (Boston Scientific， USA) was successfully performed by an interventional surgeon(RGA)， who has significant experience in pancreatic duct pro-cedures， on August 30， 2018. Puncture of slightly dilated duct was done through gastrocolic ligament and firm pancreatic tail tissue. Puncture pancreatography showed a fistula track from the pancreatic body pseudocyst . A 10-mm-long duc-tal stricture was found in the head of the gland， and guide-wire and then stent were pushed through it into the duode-num with some difficulty.\n\n【45】The postoperative period was uneventful. After 3 days of oc-treotide injections (100 pg 3 times daily)， the serum amylase\n\n【46】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4. Abdominal MRI 8 days after pancreatic duct stenting： (A) cystic changes in the pancreatic head； (B) residual fistulous track.</u>\n\n【47】level was dropped to 150 IU/L， and this medication was dis-continued. Five days post-surgery， pseudocyst drain outflow was stopped， and a drain was removed. Pleural drains were also removed on day 14 after pancreatic stenting.\n\n【48】The patient's symptoms quickly improved， with normalization of body temperature， decrease of dyspnea， and disappearance of cough and sputum. Follow-up CT scan revealed small localized hydropneumothorax that did not require additional drainage. Abdominal MRI showed diffuse parenchymal changes typical for CP， small pancreatic head pseudocysts with a decrease in their size ， and ductal hypertension. The PPF track was still visible .\n\n【49】The patient was discharged in satisfactory condition on September 10， 2018 and readmitted 5 weeks later for pan-creatic surgery. All the previous procedures in this case were lifesaving in fact， and indications for them were absolute. Indications for major pancreatic surgery， however， were rela-tive. These indications were established together with the pa-tient， because he wanted to get rid of external drainage. For our part， we wanted to remove the pathologically changed pan-creatic head tissue and reliably eliminate ductal hypertension.\n\n【50】Chest CT (September 20， 2018) revealed a residual air-containing cavity (4x5 cm)， without a fluid component， in the lower lobe of the left lung . The consulting thoracic surgeon stated that this finding is a normal outcome of the lung abscess and did not require any intervention. Pancreatography via stent-ing tube showed good contrast passage into the duodenum without visualization of pseudocyst and fistula track .\n\n【51】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5. Chest CT scan after second admission. Residual post-abscess changes of lung tissue (marked by oval).</u>\n\n【52】Abdominal MRI (September 21， 2018) showed a further de-crease in the size of pancreatic head pseudocysts and pan-creatic duct.\n\n【53】Pancreatic surgery was performed on September 26，2018. We performed the Bern modification of duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection (Beger procedure)- see Figure 7， with formation of pancreatowirsungojejunal anastomosis with Roux-en-Y retrocolic jejunal loop. The postoperative period\n\n【54】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 6. Pancreatography via stenting tube.

The patient was discharged on day 14post-surgery.\n\n【57】Outpatient ultrasound examination 6 months post-operation showed signs of CP (heterogeneous echo-structure of the gland with small parenchymal calcification) but without pseudocysts and ductal dilatation .\n\n【58】The patient was invited for follow-up examination at the hos-pital 1 year after surgery， but he refused it. Nevertheless， he agreed to answer our questions by telephone. He had no complaints (including no thoracic or abdominal pain). He works as a builder； the volume of physical work performed was com-parable to what he was performing before the present illness. The patient smokes 5 to 8 cigarettes per day and does not\n\n【59】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 8. Abdominal echography 6 months after pancreatic surgery. Pancreatowirsungojejunal anastomosis is marked by oval. Small calcifications in the pancreatic tissue are present.</u>\n\n【60】deny the intake of strong alcoholic beverages \"in small doses\"， but he did not clarify the frequency and volumes of their use. There were no clinical signs of exocrine and endocrine pancre-atic insufficiency in the patient， and he did not use pancreat-ic enzyme supplementation， even occasionally\n\n【61】Discussion\n\n【62】PPF is a rare complication of CP， and diagnostics and treat-ment of this condition remains challenging and often requires a multidisciplinary approach.\n\n【63】The main criterion for the diagnosis of PPF is a highly increased concentration of amylase and lipase in pleural fluid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，19，25，26\\]</u>. This test is very simple. However， the correct diagnosis of PPF is often made relatively late. The main cause for this phenom-enon is that the majority of PPF patients have“pulmonolog ical\" complaints： shortness of breath， cough， chest pain， and abdominal symptoms are minimal or even completely ab-sent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，26，27\\]</u>. Therefore， the idea of the likelihood of compli-cated pancreatitis in a patient with pleural effusion usually ap-pears after a more or less long period of time and treatment(usually ineffective). The data from English clinicians are very demonstrative： in a group of 4 patients， the time frames for establishing the correct diagnosis for PPF were very long： 12，28， 33， and 49 (!) days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. The case report from the USA is even more impressive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>： over a period of 4 months， the pa-tient underwent 4 large-volume thoracenteses， 2 chest tube placements， and 2 thoracotomies (!) for recurrent pleural ef-fusions. The etiology remained obscure until the fourth thora-centesis， when fluid amylase was measured and found to be markedly elevated. Importantly， these results were obtained\n\n【64】in countries with a highly developed economy and medicine! Obviously， the awareness of the medical community regard-ing PPF remains insufficient worldwide.\n\n【65】In our case， the delay in correct diagnosis was explained by the fact that the patient had typical symptoms of pneumo-nia with pleural effusion， and only after the treatment was performed - it would seem quite adequate， but did not have the desired effect-was the pleural fluid amylase examined.\n\n【66】More than 30 years ago， Cooper et al. recommended measur-ing the pleural fluid amylase content in any case of exudative pleural effusion of unknown etiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. As it seems now， post factum， this test could have been performed earlier in our case； the “typical portraits\" of patients with severe pneumo-nia/lung abscess and CP are very similar. In both cases， these patients are thin， young or middle-aged men， usually heavy smokers and alcohol drinkers， with a low level of social pro-tection and financial well-being.\n\n【67】By the time the correct diagnosis of PPF with lung abscesses was established， the question arose as to the optimal patient treatment. The first step was drainage of the lung abscess-es to prevent sepsis， which is the main cause of death in pa-tients with PPF \\[30J. As the second step， we performed exter-nal pseudocyst drainage. We expected that the decrease (not even the complete elimination) of pancreatic ductal hyperten-sion， achieved by this intervention， would allow for PPF reso-lution. External drainage of an abdominomediastinal fluid col-lection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u> or a formed pseudocyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u> enabled healing the PPF without additional endoscopic and surgical interventions.\n\n【68】As an alternative treatment at this stage， endoscopic stenting of the pancreatic duct after sphincterotomy or nasopancreatic drainage can be considered. However， the patient definitively refused intervention under sedation， and we already refused endotracheal anesthesia， believing that it to be extremely un-desirable in a patient with lung abscesses and persistent respi-ratory distress. Furthermore， external drainage of the pancre-atic pseudocyst， in comparison with the endoscopic stenting procedure， is a less technically difficult and much less trau-matic intervention. It should be emphasized that at that time we were dealing with a patient in severe condition， sharply weakened， and exhausted. His severe dyspnea persisted，even after drainage of lung abscesses， and he was unable to lie on his back at all. Ultrasound-guided pseudocyst drainage was performed under local anesthesia with the patient in a semi-sitting position.\n\n【69】After this procedure， the patient's condition began to improve gradually. Shortly thereafter， it became substantially easier for the patient to breathe， and his sleep and appetite improved. However， the fluid output via pleural drainage continues，\n\n【70】a phenomenon that indicated the persistence of PPF. Eventually， we decided to stent the pancreatic duct. In our case， we per-formed percutaneous external-internal stenting under ultra-sound control. In principle， it is often very difficult to insert the thinnest guidewire into the almost non-dilated Wirsung duct through the gland tissue of the stony density and then to push in the stent. However， the procedure was performed by a very experienced interventional surgeon with an extensive back-ground of pancreatic operations and was completely successful.\n\n【71】Currently， endoscopic procedures - stenting and nasopan-creatic drainage - are widely used in the management of PPF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30，33\\]</u>. Hastier et al. suggest that endoscopic interven-tion is the first-line treatment for this condition and that sur-gical intervention should be reserved as a second-line treat-ment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. Unfortunately， some publications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，35\\]</u> show the very small percentage of successful endoscopic procedures in PPF， due to severe pathological changes in the pancreas (com-pression of the pancreatic duct with stony gland tissue， duct deformity， lithiasis) and to some extent insufficient experience in endoscopic surgery on the pancreatic duct.\n\n【72】In our opinion， in the presented case， percutaneous interven-tion was preferable to endoscopic stenting： first， it required only local anesthesia； second， it was free from the specific complications of sphincterotomy (bleeding and duodenal per-foration). For the worldwide practice of treating PPF， the pro-cedure performed in our case is unique. We found in the lit-erature only one observation of PPF in which the pancreatic stent was inserted under ultrasound guidance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>.However， in that case the authors used endoscopic ultrasound with the rendezvous technique， rather than the conventional ultra-sound， as in our case.\n\n【73】Our experience in the treatment of PPF is substantial. In a 2014monograph， 12 cases were analyzed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. Currently， our series comprises 17 cases. For some patients -exhausted， cachectic， and having additional complications of pancreatitis - staged surgical treatment was unavoidable. Before the practical im-plementation of less-invasive endoscopic and interventional methods of pancreatic duct drainage， we used open pancre-atowirsungotomy with subsequent external drainage of the pancreatic duct 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. We direct our colleagues' focus to this sur-gical intervention because in the international literature，includ-ing the largest review articles on the topic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，3，25，30，33，38，39\\]</u>， the operation of external drainage of the pancreatic duct is not mentioned at all.\n\n【74】An alternative to external drainage may be the operation of open stenting of the pancreatic duct， proposed and initially tested in our country 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>. So far， there have been no cases of its use in PPF， but we believe that such cases will be regis-tered in the near future.\n\n【75】In this case， the Bern modification of Beger procedure was cho sen as the definitive treatment. We have a good impression on a series of these operations in CP， including the presented case. The experience of using resection-draining surgeries in present or recently resolved PPF and PBF is very limited. Four cases of Frey procedure have been published， 3 of which were performed for PPF and 1 for PBF， with good results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33，41，42\\]</u>. In one case， after long-term unsuccessful conservative treat-ment， Beger procedure was performed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[43\\]</u>. Finally， in one PBF case， the authors used a duodenum-preserving resection of the pancreatic head with a V-shaped excision of the pancreat-ic tissue along the duct of the body and tail of the gland 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44\\]</u>.\n\n【76】It should be emphasized that enzymatic pleural effusion in PPF is not always the “final\" complication of the fistula. In some cases， especially with late diagnosis and treatment， other more severe and life-threatening intrathoracic complications， such as hemothorax， pleural empyema， mediastinitis， pericarditis， and PBF， may develop 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8-24\\]</u>. Management of these compli-cations is not well studied (usually being empirical).\n\n【77】We were able to find in the literature only 1 case of lung ab-scess in PPF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The abscess developed as a complication of PBF， so its pathogenesis was different from our case. The pa-tient was treated by pulmonary resection and distal pancre-atectomy with splenectomy， which led to the recovery.\n\n【78】It remains unclear to us how to define lung abscesses in our case： as a complication of PPF or as a concomitant disease that developed independently of PPF? However， knowing the exact answer to this question would not be a key factor in de-termining the patient's treatment.\n\n【79】Unfortunately， we were unable to examine the patient 1 year after the surgery， as we planned. The reason for this was the patient's categorical refusal for hospitalization and examina-tion. In general， many CP patients are undisciplined， with low compliance with examination and treatment. There are sim-ilar cases in the literature when， after successful treatment of PPF， patients either refused a control examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[45\\]</u> or were completely lost to follow-up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，46\\]</u>. We had to be satis-fied with the result of a telephone survey， which showed that the patient had no complaints (neither abdominal nor tho-racic)； he works and feels good.\n\n【80】The satisfactory treatment outcome in our case was the result of the coordinated work of a multidisciplinary team of special-ists： internists， pulmonologists， intensive care specialists， gen-eral surgeons， a pancreatic surgeon， an interventional surgeon， a thoracic surgeon， medical radiologists， and a clinical phar-macologist. The importance of a multidisciplinary approach in the treatment of PPF tailored to the individual patient is also noted in recent publications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，28，47\\]</u>.\n\n【81】Conclusions\n\n【82】We presented a very rare case of CP complicated by PPF and en-zymatic pleural effusion with the formation of lung abscesses. Initially， the clinical situation was interpreted as a combination of exacerbation of CP with left-sided pneumonia complicat-ed by pleural effusion. The correct diagnosis was made with a delay， which is a fairly characteristic phenomenon for PPF. The severity of the patient's condition and respiratory failure allow the use of only minor interventions.\n\n【83】Step by step， the patient underwent drainage of lung ab-scesses， external drainage of the pancreatic pseudocyst， and external-internal stenting of the pancreatic duct under ultra-sound guidance. After PPF resolution， the patient was re-hos-pitalized and underwent the Bern modification of the Beger procedure. The individual approach to and staged character of the surgical treatment as part of a multidisciplinary collab-oration allowed us to achieve a satisfactory clinical outcome.\n\n【84】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of interests</u>\n\n【85】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【86】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Abbreviations</u>\n\n【87】通用结尾删除-1:<u>PPF - pancreaticopleural fistula； CP - chronic pancreatitis； PBF - pancreaticobronchial fistula； CT - computed tomogra-phy； MRI - magnetic resonance imaging</u>\n\n【88】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

This case report aims to introduce the use of hyperthermia， in combination with chemotherapy， for the treatment of unresectable gastric cancer in a patient implanted with a vagus nerve stimulator (VNS).\n\n【34】Case Report：\n\n【35】A 55-year-old man with dermatomyositis， laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma in situ and double synchronous gastric cancer was found to have unresectable gastric disease during surgery despite neoadjuvant chemother-apy Postoperatively， he received chemotherapy with RFhyperthermia. The patient had a VNS implant to treat epileptic seizures. VNs failure due to RF hyperthermia was an area of significant concern， and the procedures were completed with a full preparation to manage epileptic seizures in the event of its anticipated occurrence. Twenty-one thermotherapies were performed over 21 weeks. After 3 courses of S-1 chemotherapy (12 weeks) with RF hyperthermia without any adverse events， the regimen was changed to S-1+ CDDP combination che-motherapy (SP) and RF hyperthermia. The patient continued to receive treatment with a decrease in the size of the primary gastric tumors as well as lymph node metastases， without major adverse events， until he died due to disseminated disease.\n\n【36】Conclusions：\n\n【37】We report the first case of unresectable gastric cancer with VNS implants in which chemo-hyperthermal ther-apy was safe and successful. This case report highlights the importance of providing a multidisciplinary treat-ment with appropriate measures for patients with intractable cancer who have received special treatments for underlying comorbidities.\n\n【38】Keywords： Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols ·Dermatomyositis · Hyperthermia， Induced·\n\n【39】Radiofrequency Therapy· Stomach Neoplasms· Vagus Nerve Stimulation\n\n【40】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/931564\n\n【41】2257 的7 目日日30\n\n【42】Gastric cancer is commonly diagnosed at an advanced stage， and the prognosis of these patients is extremely poor. For pa-tients with locally advanced and metastatic disease， chemo therapy remains the mainstay of treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-5\\]</u>. With the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted drug therapies， chemotherapy for unresectable advanced gastric cancer has achieved a better response rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. However， the overall prognosis continues to remain poor， necessitating prog-ress in multidisciplinary therapeutic strategies and the devis-ing of new alternate treatment methods.\n\n【43】Radiofrequency (RF) hyperthermia kills the tumor cells by RF wave heating， making it a potential new anti-cancer therapeu-tic option 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8-10\\]</u>. Hyperthermia is commonly used as an ad-junct to established therapies (radiation and chemotherapy) to facilitate destruction of tumor cells and cause increased tu-mor immunogenicity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，12\\]</u>.\n\n【44】Vagus nerve stimulation therapy is sometimes used as an ad-juvant seizure therapy for refractory epilepsy seizures. Because the right vagus nerve innervates the sinoatrial node and its stimulation can cause bradycardia， asystole， and other cardiac adverse effects， the vagus nerve stimulator is usually implant-ed on the left side 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，14\\]</u>. There are previous reports stating that RF ablation in patients who have metal electronic device implants， such as a cardiac pacemaker or a vagus nerve stim-ulator (VNS)， can cause failure of the electronic devices or lead to an excessive rise in temperature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，16\\]</u>. These reports sug-gest that RF hyperthermia should be performed with extreme caution in patients with implanted electric devices.\n\n【45】Here， we present the first case of a patient with an VNS im plant for intractable seizures， diagnosed with an unresect-able gastric cancer and safely treated with hyperthermia com-bined with chemotherapy， without any major adverse events by thorough preparation. This case report demonstrates the\n\n【46】importance of multidisciplinary teamwork to take adequate measures and safely treat patients with intractable cancers having comorbidities requiring special treatments.\n\n【47】Case Report\n\n【48】A 55-year-old man was referred to the Department of Neurology of Narita Memorial Hospital from another hospital， reporting he had been experiencing facial rash and muscle weakness for2 months. A skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of dermato-myositis. The patient had a history of refractory epilepsy for which he had received oral treatment and vagus nerve stimu-lation. The VNS (AspireSR Model 106； LivaNova USA， Inc.， USA) was implanted in the left anterior chest. Figure 1 outlines the clinical course of this patient after visiting our hospital. As der-matomyositis may be associated with malignancy， the patient was investigated further. Both the tumor markers， carcinoem-bryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9)， were within the normal range (CEA<5.0 ng/mL，CA19-9 <37 U/mL). The patient also underwent esophagogastroduodenosco-py (EGD)， endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS)， and a computed tomography (CT) scan. EGD showed ulcerative lesions in the middle of the gastric corpus and the gastric antrum that were biopsied， and histopathological examination revealed a dou-ble synchronous gastric cancer ， morphologi-cally diagnosed as poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. EUS revealed an irregular， low-echoic area on the posterior wall of the gastric antrum that continued from the head to the body of pancreas， and a mass of enlarged lymph nodes and tumor. Abdominal CT showed a gastric wall thickness and enlarged lymph nodes along the lesser curvature， com-mon hepatic artery， and para-aortic region . No distant metastases or ascites were identified. However， based on the EUS and CT findings， it was suggested that the tumor in the middle of the gastric corpus may have invaded the pan-creatic tail and that the tumor in the gastric antrum might have invaded the pancreatic head . In addition，\n\n【49】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1. Clinical course of the patient.

The patient's primary prog-nostic factor for survival was determined to be the advanced gastric cancer； thus， he was put on a strict follow-up sched-ule for the laryngeal in situ cancer.\n\n【52】The gastric carcinoma was clinically staged as cT4bN3aM1(cStage IVB) according to the 15th edition of the Japanese Classification of Gastric Carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The fifth edition of the Japanese gastric cancer treatment guidelines suggest surgical resection after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in\n\n【53】cases of stage l gastric cancer with limited numbers of pa-ra-aortic lymph node metastasis and bulky lymph node me-tastasis without other non-curative factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Our patient was informed that he could choose NAC or alternative treat-ments such as preceding surgery， chemotherapy， and pallia-tive treatment. Then， he chose NAC as the standard treatment， expecting the tumor-reduction effect. Therefore， S-1 (an oral5-fluorouracil prodrug) and oxaliplatin chemotherapy (SOX) was initiated for the treatment of the unresectable advanced gastric cancer (S-1，100 mg/body/day for 3 weeks； oxaliplat-in， intravenous infusion of 130 mg/m² day 1) as NAC for con-version surgery. However， NAC was abandoned at the end of\n\n【54】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3. Enhanced CT images before chemotherapy.

A follow-up CT scan after the single course of SOX therapy revealed smaller re-gional lymph nodes ； thus， the patient was consid-ered for total gastrectomy.\n\n【56】On laparotomy examination， there was no remarkable peri-toneal dissemination， and peritoneal lavage cytology showed no cancer cells in the abdominal cavity. However， the status of pancreatic invasion， as diagnosed before the operation， re-mained unchanged . Considering the patient’s gen-eral condition and comorbidities， radical resection was aban-doned and a palliative gastrojejunal bypass was performed. The postoperative course was uneventful， and he was discharged on the 9th postoperative day. While awaiting recovery of the patient's general condition， postoperative oral S-1， twice daily，\n\n【57】at a dose of 100 mg/body/day， was administered for 28 con-secutive days followed by a 14-day rest period. When chemo-therapy was started， the patient expressed a strong desire to receive RF hyperthermia in combination with the chemother-apy. Because he had an implanted VNS for the management of epileptic seizures， we were concerned about device failure due to RF hyperthermia. Therefore， we provided the patient with sufficient information about expected complications and adverse events of RF hyperthermia and obtained an informed consent for the same. The VNS was suspended during the hy-perthermia treatment， which was performed with full prepara-tion to manage epileptic seizures in the event of its anticipat-ed occurrence. RF hyperthermia was performed once a week， over 21 weeks， with a 40-min irradiation with an 8-MHz RF capacitive heating device (Thermotron RF-8； Yamamoto Vinita Co.， Ltd.， Japan). As there were no adverse events such as pain\n\n【58】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4. Change in lymph node size before and after NAC on CT images.

After 3 courses of S-1 chemotherapy combined with RF hyper-thermia without any adverse events， the treatment regimen was changed to S-1+ CDDP combination chemotherapy (SP； S-1， 100 mg/body/day for 21 consecutive days followed by a14-day rest； CDDP， intravenous infusion of 60 mg/m² day 8) for stronger antitumor efficacy. Five months after treatment， the follow-up EGD showed reduction in size of the double gas-tric cancers， and CT confirmed the reduction in the size of the lymph node metastases . However， after receiv-ing 1 course of SP chemotherapy， the patients’ general condi-tion rapidly deteriorated. CT images revealed ascites and an increase in the size of the primary tumor. The patient was di-agnosed with peritoneal dissemination  and he unfortunately died due to his illness 8 months after beginning treatment at our hospital.\n\n【61】Written consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this study according to guidelines of the Ethics Committee of Narita Memorial Hospita! (approval number， R1-22-01).\n\n【62】Discussion\n\n【63】Hyperthermia is a treatment that raises the temperature either locally or systemically 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. In cancer patients it can weaken or kill tumor cells without affecting normal cells. Cancerous cells have difficulty in dissipating heat due to disorganized vascu-lar structures. Even if the cancerous cells do not die complete-ly， hyperthermia can cause cancerous cells to become more sensitive to radiotherapy or chemotherapy， allowing dose re-duction. Recently， several reports have documented the use-fulness of hyperthermia； especially comparison of anti-can-cer therapeutic effects with chemotherapy and radiotherapy，\n\n【64】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 6.

In the field of oncology， many studies on hyperthermia have been published 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23-25\\]</u>. Recently， Shoji et al demonstrated that standardized RF hyperthermia could be established as a potential new treatment for rectal cancer in combination with chemoradiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. We have also reported the efficacy of hyperthermia combined with chemotherapy for recurrent\n\n【67】breast cancer\\[26J. Our patient was also treated with 8-MHz RF hyperthermia in combination with chemotherapy， and he did not report any major adverse events.\n\n【68】However， RF hyperthermia in patients with metal electronic device implants， such as a cardiac pacemaker and VNS， may cause failure of the electronic devices or an excessive rise in temperature. Therefore， the procedure must be planned in consultation with the patient's physician in order to turn off the active mode of the electric devices during the procedure. After the RF hyperthermia procedure， these devices must be re-programmed as necessary. We consulted the relevant ep-ilepsy specialists， clinical radiologists， clinical engineers， VNS\n\n【69】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 7. CT images 8 months after the start of treatment.

The pa-tient received RF hyperthermia， owing to his request for the same， with sufficient precautionary measures against com-plications. With adequate preparation， such as immediate availability of antiepileptic drugs in the event of an epileptic seizure or a temporary suspension of the VNS by a clinical en-gineer， the patient received hyperthermia without any adverse events. To the best of our knowledge， there are no previous-ly published reports in PubMed on the use of hyperthermia in combination with chemotherapy for cancer patients with VNS implants. We herein report the first case of unresectable gastric cancer in a patient with an VNS implant who was suc-cessfully treated with chemo-hyperthermal therapy without major adverse events.\n\n【71】Autoimmunity has been reported as an alternative etiology of gastric inflammation， the initiating event in the gastric car-cinogenic cascade， and may be associated with gastric car-cinogenesis through different potential pathways 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27，28\\]</u>. Dermatomyositis has been reported to increase the risk of ma-lignancy. About 9-30% of patients with dermatomyositis have malignancies， which is 2.4-5 times higher than that seen in the normal population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29，30\\]</u>. The fact that our patient had syn-chronous gastric primaries along with in situ squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx also suggests that dermatomyositis is associated with a higher risk of malignancy. Regarding derma-tomyositis in association with gastric cancer， it has been pre-viously reported that dermatomyositis improved after tumor resection. In our case， tumor reduction surgery was initially considered but later abandoned due to advanced tumorinva-sion into the head and tail of the pancreas. It was feared that\n\n【72】a total gastrectomy along with total pancreatectomy as a tu-mor debulking procedure in this case would cause significant difficulties in introducing postoperative chemotherapy due to serious surgical damage and rapid progression of cancerous peritonitis due to exposure of the tumor. Hence， the patient did not undergo resection and was given chemotherapy in com-bination with hyperthermia for unresectable gastric cancer.\n\n【73】Although the advanced gastric cancer in this case was not cured， EGD showed reduction in the size of the gastric tumors and CT revealed reduction in the size of lymph node metastases in a follow-up examination during treatment. Unfortunately， the patient died of peritoneal dissemination 8 months after treatment was started at our hospital. He， however， remained calm throughout his course of treatment and was able to re-ceive RF hyperthermia with chemotherapy on an outpatient basis until the peritoneal dissemination was confirmed. It has been reported that the median overal! survival (OS) is about6-14 months and the median progression-free survival (PFS) is about 4-6 months in patients with unresectable gastric can-cer receiving chemotherapy with a good performance status(an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status(ECOG PS) of 0-2) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-5\\]</u>. In this case， hyperthermia combined with chemotherapy was unable to prolong OS， but it did pro-long PFS of this patient and maintain his quality of life， de-spite a poor ECOG PS of 3.\n\n【74】This is the first reported case of a patient with VNS implant for intractable seizures， diagnosed with an unresectable gas-tric cancer and treated with hyperthermia in combination with chemotherapy， without any major adverse events. Of course， the effectiveness of this treatment may be limited to specif-ic cases； therefore， more cases need to be accumulated to ex-amine the usefu lness of this treatment in detail.\n\n【75】This case report indicates the importance of providing a multi-disciplinary treatment with appropriate measures for intracta-ble cancer patients who have received special treatments for underlying comorbidities. Of course， further clinical trials are certainly needed to establish further multidisciplinary treat-ment. Adequate and safe palliative therapies go a long way in maintaining the quality of life even though treatment with curative intent is not possible in these patients.\n\n【76】Acknowledgements\n\n【77】The authors thank Dr. Takamichi Yamamoto (Comprehensive Epilepsy Center， Seirei Hamamatsu General Hospital， Shizuoka Japan) for sharing his expertise on treatment of epilepsy in this patient.\n\n【78】References：\n\n【79】1\\.

These anomalies arise as a result of abnormal organogene sis， fusion， or resorption and are frequently associated with congenital renal malformation， ovarian malposition， and ano-rectal abnormalities. Didelphic uterus is reported to occur in0.1% to 0.5% of women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Complete duplication of uterus， vagina， urethra， and bladder is even rarer， with very few cas-es reported in the literature.\n\n【31】Here we present a case report of a patient with a known uter-us didelphys associated with a double vagina and 2 urinary bladders (hemibladders) who sought medical attention for postmenopausal bleeding. The complete delineation of her urinary tract anomalies - in particular， the number of ureters and how they drained into her urinary hemibladders - was largely uncertain.\n\n【32】This case report describes an interesting clinical scenario of a common condition， postmenopausal bleeding， in the setting of a rare congenital anomaly and outlines challenges in its eval-uation and treatment.\n\n【33】Case Report\n\n【34】The patient is a 58-year-old Caucasian postmenopausal woman， gravida 2 para 2. The patient sought medical attention at the gynecologic oncology clinic for evaluation of postmenopaus-al bleeding in the setting of a thickened endometrial stripe. She was known to have a congenital anomaly that included a duplicated genitourinary system (2 hemiuteri and cervices，2 vaginas，2 clitorises， and 2 urinary hemibladders) and also a lower gastrointestinal (Gl) tract abnormality surgically cor-rected in early childhood.\n\n【35】Her past medical history is notable for morbid obesity (body mass index \\[BMI\\] 41.5) and hypertension. Her past surgical history included a reconstructive anorectal surgery in child-hood， umbilical hernia repair， and 2 low vertical cesarean de-liveries. She was a smoker until age 44. Her menarche was at age 12， and she had a history of 2 full-term pregnancies， both in the right uterus， with cesarean delivery. She had no histo-ry of hormone replacement therapy. She had no history of ab-normal pap smear results and was up to date on pap smear screening. Her last menstrual period was at the age of 50 years.\n\n【36】She was in her usual state of health until 5 months before the current visit， when she had had a 5-day episode of vaginal bleeding intermittently coming from both vaginas. Her initial gynecologic evaluation included a transabdominal ultrasound\n\n【37】examination that revealed a thickened endometrial stripe in her right hemiuterus (9 mm)， a normal endometrial stripe in her left hemiuterus (4 mm)， a left ovary with a simple-appear-ing cyst， and a normal right ovary. An in-office Pipelle@endo-metrial biopsy was attempted but was unsuccessful. A plan was then made to follow up with an ultrasound examination in 3 months.\n\n【38】On repeat ultrasound examination， the endometrial stripe mea-sured 10 mm in the right hemiuterus and 4 mm to 5 mm in the left， with both ovaries appearing normal. A subsequent So-nohysterogram revealed right uterine endometrial stripe even thicker at 13 mm without evidence of distinct polyps/masses. She was then referred to the gynecologic oncology clinic for further evaluation and management.\n\n【39】During her visit to the gynecologic oncology clinic， the patient was asymptomatic except for minimal postprocedural spotting. Her vital signs were within normal limits. Pertinent physical examination findings included widely separated labia and du-plicated vagina and cervices. Her presentation and ultrasound findings were concerning for possible endometrial neoplasia， and as such endometrial sampling was warranted.\n\n【40】The patient was given an examination in the operating room(OR) under anesthesia， including hysteroscopy with dilatation and curettage (D&C). The OR assessment revealed a larger right vagina with a distinct urethral orifice and a smaller left vagina with an unclearly identified urethral orifice. Through hysteroscopy， left and right endometrial cavities were visual-ized. Both uteri had an endometrial cavity without obvious evidence of polyps or other gross lesions. The left uterus was notably underdeveloped， with a stenotic cervix； the cornua in the left uterus was difficult to identify definitively. Both uteri were curetted， but only a minimal amount of tissue was ob-tained from each； the pathologic examination did not reveal enough endometrial tissue to provide a diagnosis.\n\n【41】The endometrial sampling was inconclusive and there was persistent concern for possible endometrial malignancy given her endometrial thickness and BMI. After thorough counsel-ing， the patient made the decision to proceed with removal of i and frozen section evaluation with possible stag-ing depending on these findings. She also decided to have a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy at the time of the planned surgical procedure regardless of the frozen section findings. She was recommended to have a preoperative magnetic res-onance imaging (MRI) scan to better characterize her urolog-ic anomalies； however， she could not afford this.\n\n【42】The surgery was performed laparoscopically. After the abdom-inal cavity was entered， the survey of the pelvis revealed 2widely separated uteri with the left uterus in close proximity\n\n【43】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1. Laparoscopic image showing 2 widely separated uteri with the left uterus in close proximity to the left pelvic side wall (L) and right uterus closer to a more central location (R).

Each uterus had its own fallopian tube and ovary， with a total of 2 fallopian tubes and2 ovaries . Each uterus and cervix communicated to its own separate vagina， as mentioned previously. There were no gross abnormalities otherwise noted in the abdomen or pel-vis and no free fluid seen. At the time of laparoscopic evalua-tion， there appeared to be 1 midline urinary bladder； 2 distinct\n\n【45】urinary bladders could not be identified. Some adhesions of the omentum to the anterior abdominal wall were noted.\n\n【46】Before performing both hysterectomies， the retroperitoneal space was entered bilaterally. Two ureters (1 on either side) were identified， and ureterolysis was done to the level of the corresponding uterine artery. The hysterectomies and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed thereafter in the usual fashion and the vaginas were sutured laparoscopically.Because of ureteral manipulation during bilateral ureterolysis， the deci-sion was made to perform cystoscopy at the end of the proce-dure. Before cystoscopy， the patient received methylene blue intravenously to aid in the identification of the ureteral jets. The right urinary bladder was inspected via the right urethra， and only 1 ureteral orifice and jet was noted. Intraoperative intravenous pyelogram (IVP) revealed an obvious right urinary bladder and a less distinct left urinary bladder， with 1 ureter emanating from each renal pelvis . Because of distorted anatomy， involvement of the urology team was need-ed to find the patient’s left urethra. A much smaller left urethra was eventually identified slightly retracted above the left va-gina. A 17F scope was passed into the left bladder after dila-tation. The left ureteral orifice was seen and a blue-tinged jet\n\n【47】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2. (A) IVP demonstrating 1 ureter on either side emanating from each renal pelvis.

The ureter was then instilled with contrast dye and the retrograde pyelogram revealed a normal-caliber left ureter and a nondilated left collecting sys-tem. She was therefore noted to have 2 kidneys and interest-ingly each kidney had a single ureter which drained into a dis-tinct and separate urinary bladder.\n\n【50】At this point， because frozen sections did not reveal malignancy， the procedure was completed . Foley catheters were placed in both urinary bladders. Estimated blood loss during the procedure was 50 mL. The final procedure was total lapa-roscopic right and left hysterectomy，bilateral salpingo-oopho-rectomy， lysis of adhesions， bilateral ureterolysis， bilateral cys-toscopy， IP， and retrograde left pyelogram.\n\n【51】The patient's postoperative course was uncomplicated， and she was discharged home on postoperative day 2 in good condition after passing the voiding trials. The final patholo-gy showed both cervices had no significant abnormality； both uteri contained small endometrial polyps， small (<0.4 cm) leio-myomas， and weakly proliferative endometrium. A benign se-rous cystadenoma was identified in 1 ovary， and the fallopian tubes were without abnormality.\n\n【52】Discussion\n\n【53】This case presents a typical clinical scenario of a patient with postmenopausal bleeding and thickened endometrial stripe that warranted further evaluation to rule out an endometrial precancerous condition. Fortunately， the final pathologic eval-uation did not reveal malignancy； nevertheless， the evaluation and management steps (in-office endometrial biopsy， followed by hysteroscopy/D&C， then by hysterectomy) were appropriate. However， all steps of this work-up and treatment were compli-cated by the congenital pelvic organ malformation - urogenital\n\n【54】duplication -that made preoperative evaluation and intraop-erative management challenging and required a multiteam ap-proach. A thorough understanding of the embryologic basis for such anomalies and the potential for associated malfor-mations may improve patient care in such complicated cases.\n\n【55】Urogenital duplications are rare congenital anomalies with varying modes of presentation. The exact anatomy depends on the type of anomaly and is related to the error in embry-ologic development. By the fourth week of embryonic devel-opment， the urogenital ridge is formed on both sides of the dorsal aorta， further giving rise to the nephrogenic cord and the gonadal ridge， which subsequently develop into the uri-nary and genital systems， respectively. By the fifth and sixth weeks， 2 pairs of genital ducts are present in both male and female embryos - mesonephric (wolffian) and paramesoneph-ric (mullerian). In the absence of male developmental stim-uli， the paramesonephric ducts continue to develop. By the process of fusion that starts caudally and progresses cranial-ly， mullerian ducts form the uterovaginal canal that later de-velops into the upper portion of the vagina and uterus， while their nonfused portions become fallopian tubes. Female gu-bernaculum is an embryonic structure that is thought to play an important role in the development of Mullerian ducts in a female embryo. It is believed to be of muscular origin and by being attached to the mullerian ducts it allows or even in-duces proper development of the uterus and fallopian tubes. Further into development female gubernaculum persists as the round ligament which penetrates abdominal wall， and ovari-an ligament 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Reproductive system develops in close prox-imity in location and time to urinary tract and lower GI sys-tems. During the fourth week of development a blind-ended caudal hindgut is formed. The most distal end of the hindgut is the cloaca， which by the seventh to eighth week becomes separated by urorectal septum into the anorectal canal and the urogenital sinus (subsequently giving rise to urinary blad-der and urethra) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The latter contacts the uterovaginal pri-mordium， which results in the formation of paired outgrowths- sinovaginal bulbs. Sinovaginal bulbs eventually fuse to form the vaginal plate， the central part of which breaks down and forms the lower aspect of the vaginal lumen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>\n\n【56】Three separate classification systems have been proposed to classify female genital anomalies： the American Fertility Society(AFS) classification system； the embryological-clinical classifica-tion system； and the Vagina， Cervix， Uterus， Adnexa， and asso-ciated Malformations (VCUAM) classification system， with the AFS system being the most widely used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. According to the AFS system， the 7 distinct groups of female genital anomalies include (l) segmental or complete agenesis or hypoplasia， (II) unicornuate uterus with or without a rudimentary horn， (III) didelphys uterus， (IV) complete or partial bicornuate uterus，(V) complete or partial septate uterus， (VI) arcuate uterus， and\n\n【57】(VII) diethylstilbestrol (DES)-related anomalies. Embryologically these groups reflect an arrest in 1 of the following processes：initial development (groups l and Il)， fusion (groups Ill and ⅣV)， and degeneration (groups V and VI). Unfortunately， this classi-fication does not characterize other associated anomalies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【58】Bladder duplication can be partial (1 urethra and 2 bladder halves that are not fully separated) or complete (2 indepen-dent bladders with full thickness wall). In cases of complete bladder duplication the septum can be in sagittal or coronal planes， with the former being the most common type 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. There may be a partial or complete duplication of the genital tract in patients with bladder duplication， ranging from a bicornu-ate uterus to complete duplication of uterus， vagina， and vul-va. Some patients are identified in childhood because of ab-normalities of external genitalia， voiding difficulties， urinary tract obstruction， incontinence， anorectal， or skeletal malfor-mations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Other patients can remain asymptomatic for many years and are found during evaluation for infertility， endome-triosis， or miscarriage or as incidental findings in adulthood. The prevalence of urologic anomalies accompanying mulleri-an anomalies is approximately 3% to 50%. Other congenital anomalies that may also be present include skeletal (29%) and cardiac anomalies (14.5%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【59】A wide spectrum of associated congenital anomalies exists in women with bladder and urethral duplication， including caudal Gl malformations， such as anal stenosis， ectopic anus， and par-tial or complete colon， rectum or anus duplication. Infrequently， the duplication can extend as far proximal as to include the terminal ileum. One of the largest studies to review bladder and urethral duplication reported that of 40 patients of both sexes with bladder and urethral duplication， 42% had dupli-cation of the hindgut and 90% had some form of duplication of external genitalia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Sagittal bladder and urethral dupli-cation ， as was discovered in our patient， is as-sociated with nonurogenital anomalies， such as duplication of the hindgut， more often than coronal bladder duplication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.

Not surprisingly， the management of post-menopausal bleeding in this patient was challenging because of her complex anatomy. At the time of the examination un-der anesthesia， a pediatric speculum was used to visualize the left cervix through the smaller and more lateral left vagina. Hysteroscopy revealed a single cornua in each uterus， which was confirmed at the time of laparoscopic hysterectomy. On laparoscopy， each uterus had a single fallopian tube emanat-ing from a defined cornua . The altered anatomy ne-cessitated retroperitoneal dissection and bilateral ureterolysis at the time of laparoscopic hysterectomy. Careful dissection was especially performed during the left hysterectomy due to the lateral location of the uterus to avoid injury to the ureter and the pelvic side wall vasculature.\n\n【64】In this case， intraoperative IVP was able to substitute for pre-operative MRI evaluation of the urologic system. Generally， MRI scan is the imaging method of choice for characterizing complex urogenital abnormalities.

In hindsight， preoperative IVP would have been helpful in the ab-sence of MRI， but it was not performed. In the current case， in-traoperative IVP was key in identifying the number of ureters and their drainage into the urinary hemibladders. The IP as-sisted with the interpretation of findings on cystoscopy and provided critical information before the left retrograde pyelo-gram. It would have been difficult to exclude a potential inju-ry to an overlooked double ureter on either side without these intraoperative studies.\n\n【65】Conclusions\n\n【66】Management of patients with urogenital duplication and ab-normal uterine bleeding requires a thorough understanding of possible associated malformations. Careful surgical explo-ration and intraoperative urologic studies， as well as urology consultation， may be necessary to avoid urologic injury，espe-cially in patients who lack preoperative imaging.\n\n【67】Statement\n\n【68】There was no financial support to disclose\n\n【69】3\\.

Post-cholecystectomy Mirizzi syndrome(PCMS) is Mirizzi syndrome in the post-surgical absence of a gallbladder. Complications of Mirizzi syndrome may include fibrotic stricture of the bile duct， cholecystobiliary fistula， cho-lecystitis， or cholangitis. Methods to identify and treat PCMS have evolved over decades from open surgical exploration to less invasive alternatives. We describe an atypical case of PCMS， compare it to the 64 cases of PCMS we identified in 15 previ-ously published case reports and series of PCMS， discuss the incidence， risk factors， clinical presentation， biochemical ab-normalities， imaging characteristics， natural history and com-plications of PCMS， and focus on the diagnostic and treatment options currently available to evaluate and manage PCMS.\n\n【27】Case Report\n\n【28】A 44-year-old female in otherwise good health with a history of cholecystectomy 25 years prior to presentation arrived at the emergency department reporting 12 hours of severe ab-dominal pain beginning 3 hours after eating lunch. The pain was constant， sharp， burning， and up to a 10 out of a possible10 in intensity， radiating from the epigastrium to the subster-nal chest， right abdomen， and mid-back. The pain was wors-ened by eating， unrelieved by simethicone， and associated with nausea， an episode of bilious vomiting， and fatigue. The pa-tient denied fever， jaundice， change in the color of her urine， and change in the color of her stool.\n\n【29】Two weeks prior to presentation， she had an attack of abdom-inal pain that was similar in quality but milder in intensity and shorter in duration. Her symptoms were reminiscent of those with which she presented when suffering from acute calculous cholecystitis at the age of 19 years， for which she had an un-eventful laparoscopic cholecystectomy and recovery.\n\n【30】The patient's past medical and surgical histories also included exercise-induced asthma and bilateral tubal ligation. She drank a total of 3 to 4 alcoholic beverages each weekend， most re-cently 3 days prior to admission， and did not drink alcohol dur-ing the work week. She did not take any medication or herbal supplement. She denied a history of jaundice， tattoo，intrave-nous drug use， blood transfusion， sexual contact with an in-dividual known to have liver disease， and travel to an area in which viral hepatitis is endemic. She had no known family his-tory of gastrointestinal，hepatic， biliary， or pancreatic disease.\n\n【31】On physical examination， the patient appeared to be in pain. Blood pressure was 146/99 mmHg， pulse was 96 beats/min-ute， respirations were 20 breaths/minute， and temperature was 96.9°F. Weight was 75 kilograms and body mass index was 29.2 kg/m? The skin was normal， without jaundice，tel-angiectasia， or palmar erythema. The sclerae were non-icteric. Auscultation of the heart and posterior lung fields were nor-mal. The abdomen appeared overweight without distension. Bowel sounds were normal. The epigastrium and right upper quadrant were tender， without appreciable mass， organomeg aly， guarding， or rebound tenderness.\n\n【32】Initial laboratory results revealed white blood cells 11.7x10/uL(normal range， 4.0-10.5×10/uL))， 79%(25-62%) of which were segmented neutrophils， hemoglobin 14.5 g/dL (12.5-16.0 g/dL)， platelets 327x10/uL (150-450x10/uL)，international normal-ized ratio (INR) 0.9 (0.8-1.1)， albumin 4.3 g/dL (3.5-5.0 g/dL)， to-tal bilirubin 2.2 mg/dL(0.3-1.0 mg/dL)， direct bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL(0.0-0.2 mg/dL)， alkaline phosphatase 163 U/L (34-104 U/L)， aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 779 U/L (13-39 U/L)， ala-nine aminotransferase (ALT) 644 U/L (7-52U/L)， lipase 8 U/L(11-82 U/L)， and troponin <0.03 ng/mL (<0.03 ng/mL).\n\n【33】A sample of urine obtained by straight catheterization of the bladder appeared clear and yellow. Chemical analysis demon-strated no nitrites， protein， glucose， ketones， or conjugated bili-rubin and 150 red blood cells/uL Microscopic analysis revealed no white blood cell， 6-10 (normal range， 0-2) red blood cells， up to 5 epithelial cells， and 2+ bacteria per high-powered field.\n\n【34】An ultrasound of the abdomen identified a hyperechoic region2.3 cm in maximal dimension within the right hepatic lobe sus-pected to be either a hemangioma or focal fatty infiltration. Intrahepatic bile ducts were normal. Surgical absence of the gallbladder was noted. The common bile duct was described as normal， measuring 7 mm in diameter. Color flow Doppler spectral analysis of the portal vein was normal.\n\n【35】A broad differential diagnosis of acute cholestatic hepatitis was entertained， including acute viral infectious hepatitis， isch-emic hepatitis， and occult hepatotoxicity， given transaminase concentrations approaching 1，000 U/L Extrahepatic biliary ob-struction， with atypically high transaminases， was also COn-sidered. Acute alcoholic or autoimmune hepatitis was thought to be much less likely.\n\n【36】Asymptomatic bacteriuria was diagnosed， given the absence of dysuria， polyuria， flank pain， and pyuria. Microscopic hematu-ria was suspected to have been the result of a traumatic cath-eterization. Antibiotics were not administered.\n\n【37】After the administration of tramadol 50 mg orally， hydromor-phone 1 mg intravenously and prochlorperazine intravenously，\n\n【38】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

The physical examination was unchanged. Repeat blood test results revealed white blood cells 6.9 k/uL， 65% of which were segmented neu-trophils， hemoglobin 13.3 g/dL， total bilirubin 5.0 mg/dL， direct bilirubin 3.4 mg/dL， alkaline phosphatase 209 U/L， AST 929 U/L， and ALT 1，169 U/L Blood tests screening for alcohol， acetamino-phen， salicylates， and acute hepatitis A， B and C were negative.\n\n【41】Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) was performed on the second day of hospitalization， the interpretation of which initially described a 6x9 mm calculus in the common bile duct(CBD) located at the level of the pancreatic head， upstream from which the common hepatic duct (CHD) was 11 mm and the intrahepatic bile ducts (IHDs) were moderately dilated， and downstream from which the distal CBD was normal， measur-ing 3 mm .\n\n【42】Later that day， endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogra-phy (ERCP) using a therapeutic video duodenoscope revealed a normal distal common bile duct 3-4 mm wide， a narrowed section in the mid-extrahepatic bile duct， and dilated common hepatic and intrahepatic ducts.

A bloodless 1 cm long biliary sphincterotomy was performed， after which the common hepatic and common bile ducts were swept with a 9-12 mm biliary balloon over a guidewire with expression of minimal sludge and no stone. Occlusion cholan-giography revealed 2 sub-centimeter filling defects consistent with mobile gallstones in the cystic duct remnant which was approximately 5 cm long and up to 8 mm wide. The cystic duct remnant was swept several times， first with the catheter's bal-loon inflated to 9 mm and then with a trapezoidal biliary bas-ket， neither of which extracted a stone. Contrast drained rapidly from the biliary tree. As the extrahepatic biliary obstruction ap-peared to have resolved during endoscopic manipulation of the biliary tree， presumably by dislodging the impacted gallstone(s) up into the cystic duct remnant， a common bile duct stent was not placed .\n\n【45】On the following day， the patient remained symptomatic. Total bilirubin increased to 6.1 mg/dL Alkaline phosphatase remained unchanged. Repeat MRCP confirmed a dilated cystic duct rem-nant 7 mm wide containing a round filling defect 6 mm wide near its insertion into the junction of the CHD and CBD， con-sistent with a gallstone， and no dilatation of the CBD， CHD，or intrahepatic biliary ducts .\n\n【46】O Am J Case Rep2019； 20：1290-1298\n\n【47】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3.

During ERCP there，2 gallstones within the cystic duct remnant were fractured using electrohydraulic shockwaves created and delivered by a 0.63 mm-wide catheter advanced into the cystic duct through the 1.2 mm-wide accessory channel of a 3.5 mm-wide video cholangioscope which， itself， was passed through the acces-sory channel of a therapeutic video duodenoscope. The stone fragments were removed， after which the common bile duct was stented to prevent any risk of recurrent extrahepatic bil-iary obstruction from post-lithotripsy traumatic acute edema of the bile duct wall.\n\n【50】At the patient's third (and final) ERCP， performed as an out-patient 6 weeks later at the same referral hospital， the pro-phylactic biliary stent was removed， and cholangiography was normal. Neither persistent gallstone nor biliary stricture was identified. At subsequent follow-up with her primary care phy-sician， the patient reported no recurrence of biliary symptoms and surveillance complete blood cell and liver tests were normal.\n\n【51】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4. Two minutes post-first endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography， demonstrating rapid drainage without evidence of a residual biliary stricture.</u>\n\n【52】Discussion\n\n【53】Our patient's cholecystectomy in the late 1990s was 1 of an estimated 500，000-600，000 performed annually in the United States at that time， most of which were completed laparo-scopically 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Unfortunately，anywhere from 10-15% of these\n\n【54】patients likely had persistent or recurrent biliary symptoms or developed new symptoms， like diarrhea， attributed to the sur-gery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Patients with these post-operative symptoms are con-sidered to have post-cholecystectomy syndrome and may suf-fer from a variety of structural or functional diseases intrinsic or extrinsic to the residual biliary tree， one of which is PCMS. To better understand its incidence， risk factors， clinical pre-sentation， biochemical abnormalities， imaging characteristics， natural history， management， and complications， we reviewed64 cases of PCMS from 15 case reports and studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-16\\]</u>.\n\n【55】Mirizzi syndrome is named after Pablo Luis Mirizzi， who was a Professor of Surgery at the National University of Cordoba in Argentina. He lived from 1893 to 1964， trained in Argentina， Europe， and the United States of America， and ultimately was honored internationally for his surgical skill， dedication to teaching， and contributions to humanity. After performing the first operative cholangiogram in 1931， he described he-patic duct obstructions in the 1940s to which his name is now eponymously attached. Of note， Dr. Mirizzi mistakenly believed that hepatic duct obstruction associated with adjacent gall-stone disease was caused by spasm of a hepatic duct sphincter. Subsequent anatomical studies of the hepatic duct failed to reveal even smooth muscle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.Our understanding of Mirizzi syndrome， including PCMS， continues to evolve.\n\n【56】The incidence of Mirizzi syndrome is likely between 0.7%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> and 2.1%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> over a 20-year interval among patients ultimately scheduled for cholecystectomy. Estimates of the incidence of PCMS range from<2.5% over a 2-year interval 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> to as high as 7% over a 4-year interval 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u> when calculi in the gallblad-der remnant or cystic duct following subtotal cholecystectomy and in the cystic duct remnant following complete cholecys-tectomy are considered together.\n\n【57】Among the 64 case reports of PCMS evaluated for this re-view， symptoms or signs of PCMS developed as early as a few days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u> and as late as 40 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> following cholecystectomy and at an average age of 49 years (with a standard deviation of 18 years)， among whom 60% were female. The presence or absence of obes ity was reported inconsistently. Patients with PCMS most commonly reported right upper quadrant pain， nausea， vomiting， or jaundice. They less commonly reported epigastric pain， anorexia， pruritus， or weight loss， and occa-sionally reported fever. The most commonly reported physi-cal examination findings (in descending order of prevalence) were right upper quadrant tenderness， jaundice， fever， and epigastric tenderness.\n\n【58】Regarding surgical and anatomical risk factors for PCMS， lap-aroscopic cholecystectomy， particularly when subtota! 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， a cystic duct remnant longer than 1 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>， and a low inser-tion of the cystic duct on the extrahepatic bile duct (resulting，\n\n【59】by definition， in a relatively short common bile duct and a rela-tively long common hepatic duct) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> were frequently reported in patients with post-cholecystectomy syndrome， some of whom had PCMS. The authors of this case report are unaware of any report that residual gallstone size is a risk factor for PCMS.\n\n【60】Consistent with these observations， our patient was female and asymptomatic for 25 years after her laparoscopic cholecystec-tomy. She complained of abdominal pain and had tenderness in the epigastrium and right upper quadrant accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Imaging ultimately identified a long cystic duct remnant with a low insertion on the extrahepatic bile duct.\n\n【61】Biochemical patterns vary in PCMS. Among the 49 of 64 pa-tients with PCMS reviewed for this report for whom labora-tory data were reported， the most common abnormality was an elevated alkaline phosphatase concentration. Among the30 patients for whom alkaline phosphatase was reported， the values ranged from 10 (upper limit of normal， 126 U/L)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> to 5，011 U/L (upper limit of normal， 114 U/L)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Among the25 patients for whom transaminases were reported，the ma-jority (56%) had normal transaminase concentrations， 24%had mildly to moderately elevated transaminases (1x<upper limit of normal ≤10x) and 20% had markedly elevated trans-aminases (>10x upper limit of normal). Our patient’s transam-inases， at 22 times the upper limit of normal， were elevated to an extent more commonly observed with hepatitis from acute viral infection， ischemia， or exposure to a hepatotoxin than from biliary obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.\n\n【62】Our patient’s complete blood count revealed a mild neutro-philia consistent with pain， hepatitis， or cholangitis. Her plate let count and INR were normal. These tests are useful to check prior to considering therapeutic endoscopy， as the risk of hem-orrhage from biliary sphincterotomy is increased in patients with coagulopathy， be it from malnutrition， intrinsic liver dis-ease， chronic biliary obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>， or thrombocytopenia from splenic sequestration in portal hypertension or from dis-seminated intravascular coagulation in sepsis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24，25\\]</u>.A pa-tient with progressive jaundice， often appreciated first by an acquaintance who has not seen the patient in the preceding several days，might not present until coagulopathic from mal-absorption of vitamin K. Vitamin K is required by hepatocytes to synthesize prothrombin， other pro-coagulants and， for that matter， anti-coagulants. Therefore， treatment with vitamin K is advised for any patient presenting with coagulopathy in the setting of a cholestatic hepatitis. Our patient had no sign of portal hypertension， sepsis or coagulopathy.\n\n【63】When treating a coagulopathic patient， vitamin K may be ad-ministered orally (if co-administered with bile acids in the absence， otherwise， of enteral bile)， subcutaneously (report-edly with unpredictable absorption)， intramuscularly (with\n\n【64】risk of hematoma and anaphylaxis) or intravenously (with risk of anaphylaxis， even when diluted and infused slowly) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Vitamin K-related coagulopathy often improves， if not resolves， within 24 hours following the first dose of vitamin K 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. If the INR fails to normalize even after 3 days of daily vitamin K sup plementation， then decompensated liver disease or dissemi-nated intravascular coagulation should be suspected.\n\n【65】Patients presenting with upper gastrointestinal symptoms and abnormal liver tests often are imaged initially with trans-abdominal ultrasound with a reported sensitivity for detect-ing choledocholithiasis in the cystic duct remnant as low as29%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u> and as high as 60% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Yet， other studies have re-ported poor sensitivity (22-55%) for detecting choledocholithia-sis， albeit in the common bile duct 通用删除7(英):<u>(29)</u>， and less than expected sensitivity (77-87%) for detecting even common bile duct di-lation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. Whether ordered in place of， preceding， or follow-ing abdominal ultrasound， computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen has a reported sensitivity for detecting cholelithia-sis in the cystic duct remnant as high as 71% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， which will be dependent on the degree to which a gallstone is calcified.\n\n【66】If the presence or absence of biliary obstruction remains un-certain after abdominal ultrasound or CT， additional imaging may be helpful. The sensitivity of MRCP for detecting stones in the cystic duct remnant ranges from 89% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> to 92%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)， widely available at tertiary and quaternary care hospitals and offered at some community hospitals， may also identify otherwise occult cystic duct rem-nant stones with a reported sensitivity of 100% in symptom-atic post-cholecystectomy patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. In a patient for whom MRCP is contraindicated and sedation for endoscopy is con-sidered high-risk， cholescintigraphy， also called hepatobiliary scintigraphy or a HIDA scan (HIDA being an acronym for hep atobiliary iminodiacetic acid， a radiotracer which hepatocytes absorb from the blood stream and excrete in the bile)， can sug-gest PCMS when radiolabeled bile collects in a prominent CHD without subsequent migration into the CBD or drainage into the duodenum. Once extrahepatic biliary obstruction is con-firmed non-invasively， regardless of the method， ERCP is the preferred intervention to relieve the obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【67】In our patient's case， the initial interpretations of noninvasive abdominal imaging misled the care team to anticipate a rou-tine therapeutic ERCP with biliary sphincterotomy and com-mon bile duct stone extraction. The abdominal ultrasound re-port mentioned neither the possibility of biliary obstruction nor choledocholithiasis. The MRCP report identified choledo-cholithiasis but mistook the long cystic duct remnant within which it was located for the common bile duct. It was not until ERCP that the calculi were appreciated to be in the cystic duct remnant， where they remained for the second MRCP， the in-terpretation of which was informed by the ERCP.\n\n【68】A common bile duct diameter of up to 10 mm in a post-cholecys-tectomy patient may be considered normal only in the absence of additional signs of biliary obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. Our patient's com-mon bile duct diameter of 7 mm， in the setting of cholestatic hepatitis， was abnormal and consistent with biliary obstruction.\n\n【69】Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids are equally effective， and superior to spasmolytics， in treating biliary colic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. NSAIDs might decrease biliary pain and even the risk of cholangitis when used to treat PCMS by decreasing prostaglandin synthesis， biliary mucus， edema and smooth mus-cle tone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. Therefore， administration of an NSAID is an ex-cellent choice to treat pain in patients suspected to have PCMS for whom there is neither history nor suspicion of peptic ulcer disease， particularly since NSAIDs are not associated with in-creased risk of post-sphincterotomy hemorrhage following ther-apeutic ERCP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. Although opioids can cause nausea or pro-voke spasm of the sphincter of Oddi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>， the latter of which could further increase intraductal biliary pressure in patients with only partial biliary obstruction from PCMS， administration of an opioid remains an excellent option to effect analgesia.Our patient received opioids and an antiemetic without an NSAID.\n\n【70】The bile is normally sterile. If cholangitis is suspected， usually from a mono-microbial infection if in a native biliary tree， a par-enteral antibiotic should be selected that is active against Gram-negative bacilli and excreted to at least some degree in the bile， as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species are the most common pathogens. If the biliary tree has been instrumented， then the increased risk of mono-microbial infection with Gram-positive cocci like enterococcus and， to a lesser extent， Streptococcus spe-cies，Gram-negative bacilli like Enterobacter species， Bacteroides， Pseudomonas aeruginosa， and Proteus species， Gram-positive bacilli in the Clostridium species， as well as polymicrobial in-fection， should be considered， for which ticarcillin/clavulanate， piperacillin/tazobactam or ceftriaxone， alone or in combination with metronidazole， is often administered empirically.\n\n【71】In obstructive jaundice caused by gallstone disease， how-ever， ceftriaxone might best be avoided， as it is lithogenic. Precipitation of the calcium salt of ceftriaxone was reported to reversibly induce biliary sludge in up to 46% of patients with-out pre-existing biliary disease exposed to this medication， some of whom became symptomatic. Patients with a polymor-phism in the TATAA box in the promoter region of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) gene， associated with Gilbert's syndrome， might be at particular risk. Quinolones， penicillins and alternative cephalosporins with adequate pen-etration in the bile (like cefazolin and cefuroxime) are alterna-tives. Still other cephalosporins (like cefotaxime， ceftazidime and cefepime)， as well as carbapenems (like imipenem and me-ropenem)， vancomycin and aminoglycosides (like gentamicin and amikacin) are excreted into the bile at less than desirable\n\n【72】concentrations， and are not the best choices when treating or preventing cholangitis or cholecystitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>.\n\n【73】In patients suspected to have sepsis from cholangitis， an an-tibiotic regimen with a sufficiently broad spectrum of em-piric activity should be administered rapidly， ideally after ob-taining blood cultures and within one hour of identifying this life-threatening concern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. An antibiotic with a narrower spectrum of activity may be substituted based upon the sub-sequent results of blood or bile cultures and antibiotic sensi-tivities reporting bacteria suspected to represent pathogens and not contaminants. Patients who appear to be recovering from cholangitis after biliary decompression may discontinue antibiotics as soon as blood cultures have ruled out bacteremia or after 5 to 7 days when accompanied by bacteremia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38，39\\]</u>.\n\n【74】Patients with biliary obstruction are particularly prone to intra-vascular volume depletion， especially when in septic or post-operative states. The risk for acute kidney injury correlates with serum bilirubin concentration and is likely multifactorial， including the natriuretic and diuretic effect of bile salts on the kidney， tendency for hypotension when dehydrated， hypo-per-fusion from myocardial dysfunction and endotoxemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>. Therefore， in the absence of congestive heart failure， aggressive intravenous fluid administration is appropriate for patients sus-pected to have PCMS， particularly if there are signs of sepsis.\n\n【75】In a risk prediction model for in-hospital mortality among patients with acute cholangitis using 22 predictors and the Tokyo criteria to stratify them into groups at high-and low-risk for mortality， organ failure was the best predictor of mortality in univariate analysis.Furthermore， confusion， hypotension requiring catechol-amines， Quick Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment (Quick SOFA) score below 50%， serum creatinine level above 2 mg/dL， and platelet count <100x10/mL all predicted organ failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u>. Although the authors stratified patients into a high-risk group meriting urgent ERCP and a lower-risk group requiring only elec-tive ERCP， a subsequent retrospective study determined that pa-tients with acute cholangitis who had ERCP within 24 hours of presentation had a lower 30-day mortality compared to patients whose ERCP was performed later in the hospitalization (8% ver-sus 19%， respectively)，even after adjusting for other competing clinical risk factors，among 244 consecutive patients with acute cholangitis treated between 2009 and 2016 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u>.\n\n【76】In the absence of suspected cholangitis， prophylactic antibi-otics prior to ERCP should be administered to patients with PCMS only if biliary drainage is expected to be incomplete fol-lowing biliary access and， if confirmed， likely should be con-tinued for several days. Prophylactic antibiotics may also be considered in immunosuppressed patients， such as those with an absolute neutrophil count <500 cells/mL， advanced hema-tologic malignancy， or a history of liver transplantation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42\\]</u>.\n\n【77】Management options for PCMS have evolved over decades from open surgery to less invasive alternatives. ERCP has been used to retrieve stones in the cystic duct remnant using catheters to perform balloon extraction， basket extraction， and mechanical lithotripsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，43\\]</u>. When attempts to access the cystic duct rem-nant fail or， once accessed， attempts to clear the stone(s) fail， a temporary plastic stent may be placed in the common bile duct， with the proximal end in the common hepatic duct and the distal end in the duodenal lumen， to traverse the stricture and decompress the biliary tree. Definitive therapy may then be deferred to a later- but not indefinite - date. Most biliary stents are made of polyethylene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44\\]</u> and tend to occlude within weeks to months after placement， regardless of design 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[45\\]</u>. Once biliary stents occlude (or- less commonly-migrate ei-ther distally or proximally enough to no longer traverse the stricture)， patients become increasingly at risk for cholangitis and life-threatening sepsis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[45\\]</u>.\n\n【78】If attempts at trans-papillary biliary access fail， or， once achieved， attempts to cannulate the biliary tree proximal to the extrahepatic biliary stricture fail， the more proximal bili-ary tree may be accessed through the wall of the stomach or proximal duodenum via EUS， after which a guidewire may be passed distally into the duodenal lumen and used in a ren-dezvous procedure to complete the ERCP. When the major pa-pilla cannot be reached， a fully covered self-expanding metallic stent may be placed under EUS guidance to effectively create a choledochogastric or choledochoduodenal fistula through which the biliary tree may be decompressed， an approach usu-ally reserved for advanced endoscopists at a tertiary or qua-ternary care hospital\n\n【79】Alternatively， transhepatic access via percutaneous cholangi-ography with placement of an external or external-internal bil-iary drain may follow the non-therapeutic ERCP. Percutaneous drainage is also appropriate for the patient considered to be at high risk of complication from anesthesia. Any exclusively external biliary drain placed either to limit further instrumen-tation of the biliary tree in the setting of cholangitis or after repeated failures to traverse a biliary stricture should be re-vised electively to include internal drainage， whenever possi-ble 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[46\\]</u>. The presence of bile within the intestinal lumen al-lows for its enterohepatic circulation， encourages absorption of fat-soluble vitamins， maintains the integrity of enterocyte tight junctions and reduces endotoxemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[47\\]</u>.\n\n【80】If standard endoscopic approaches to remove retained stones in the cystic duct remnant fail， alternatives include intraductal shock wave lithotripsy delivered through a choledochoscope-passed percutaneously， laparoscopically， or (as in this case) endoscopically， laparoscopy-assisted ERCP， or extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (without or with subsequent endoscopic removal of fragmented stones). The requisite equipment and\n\n【81】expertise for these maneuvers might be available only at a ter-tiary or quaternary care hospital 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，6\\]</u>.\n\n【82】Endoscopic electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL) is achieved by delivering oscillating shockwaves between 2 adjacent elec-trodes at the tip of a thin catheter positioned under direct endoscopic visualization (choledochoscopy) on or immedi-ately adjacent to a gallstone (and as far from the bile duct wall as possible). The EHL catheter reaches its target after being passed through the accessory channel of a mini-endo-scope which， itself， is passed through the accessory channel of a therapeutic duodenoscope (ERCP scope) in standard po-sition， then through the major papilla， common bile duct and， ultimately， into the cystic duct remnant.\n\n【83】PCMS and its management can cause complications. Some are related to the natural history of the disease， like cholangitis further complicated by bacteremia and sepsis or cholecysto-choledochal fistula. Others are iatrogenic， like post-ERCP pan-creatitis (with a reported incidence of 3.5%)， post-sphincter-otomy hemorrhage (with a reported incidence of 1.3%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[48\\]</u>， cholangitis after the biliary tree proximal to the obstruction is instrumented but not decompressed (with a reported inci-dence of 0.5-1.7%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[49\\]</u>， or bile duct perforation. Yet， most pa-tients with PCMS are cured without complication， sometimes with the help of expertise available only at a tertiary or qua-ternary care hospital where select patients may be referred or transferred.\n\n【84】References：\n\n【85】1\\.

Although non-invasive imaging， including ab-dominal ultrasound， CT， and MRCP will narrow the differen-tial diagnosis， PCMS might be discovered or confirmed only at ERCP. When extra-hepatic biliary obstruction is strongly sus-pected， gastroenterology consultation and timely ERCP is cru-cial to decompress the biliary tree and， when from gallstones， to prevent or treat cholangitis. If endoscopic attempts to drain the biliary tree fail， then interventional radiology consultation is appropriate to consider percutaneous cholangiography and biliary stenting. Physicians practicing in a community hospi-tal may refer patients with PCMS and challenging anatomy to a tertiary or quaternary care hospital with the multi-disciplin-ary expertise and equipment to care for patients with compli-cated biliary disease.\n\n【97】Department and Institution where work was done\n\n【98】Department of Intemal Medicine， St. Mary’s Hospital， Waterbury， CT， U.S.A.； Department of Internal Medicine， Yale New Haven Hospital， New Haven， CT， U.S.A.\n\n【99】11\\.

First branchial cleft anomalies are classified into 2 subtypes according to anatomical and histological features. Their diagno-sis can be difficult and depends on radiological and histological findings. In contrast， the required treatment is surgical removal， owing to the high risk of infection or malignancy. This case report introduces a first branchi-al cleft anomaly in an older woman with exclusive involvement of the external auditory canal (EAC).\n\n【29】Case Report： This case report introduces a first branchial cleft anomaly in an 82-year-old woman with exclusive involvement of the EAC She reported a history of mixed moderate hypoacusis and recurrent otitis media in the last year， without facial nerve involvement. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were performed to plan surgical treatment， which consisted of canaloplasty and Thiersch grafting. The histopathological exam-ination on operative findings revealed a cystic lesion that was lined by cylindrical epithelium adjacent to the squamous cells， compatible with a diagnosis of first branchial arch malformative residues.\n\n【30】Conclusions： This is the unique case of first branchial cleft anomalies reported in an adult patient that exclusively involved the EAC. The onset of the disease was atypical， and surgery with the total removal of the lesion was the only possible treatment. Histopathology results revealed cylindric epithelium not represented in the EAC， compat-ible with first branchial arch malformative residues. This rare condition is a potential diagnostic option that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cysts of the EAC\n\n【31】Keywords： Adult · Branchial Cleft Anomalies· Branchial Region· Ear Canal\n\n【32】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/936809\n\n【33】口\n\n【34】18\n\n【35】H893 H7 2 白13\n\n【36】Branchial cleft anomalies are congenital aberrations that devel-op from the incomplete obliteration during embryogenesis of the first to fourth pharyngeal pouches. They can result in true fistulae， cysts， or sinus tracts， particularly in the pediatric age group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【37】First branchial cleft anomalies (FBCAs) represent about 5% to25% of branchial cleft anomalies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. FBCAs are usually de fined by a smooth， non-tender， fluctuant mass that could in-volve the parotid gland 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u> and facial nerve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>. Two types of FBCAs， according to anatomical and histological features， have been identified 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Type l includes preauricular mass-es or sinus tracts localized anteriorly and/or medially to the external auditory canal， laterally to the facial nerve， and are composed only of ectoderm. Type ll cysts， with ectoderm and mesoderm， are located at the angle of the mandible and/or submandibular region， lateral or medial to the facial nerve.\n\n【38】The diagnosis of FBCAs can be difficult and depends on ra-diological and histological findings. In contrast， the required treatment is surgical removal， owing to the high risk of infec-tion or malignancy.\n\n【39】This paper aims to present a rare case of type 1 first bran-chial arch malformative residues in an older woman， with ex-clusive involvement of the external auditory canal (EAC). Its clinical and histological findings are described and discussed.\n\n【40】Case Report\n\n【41】An 82-year-old woman presented with a history of hearing loss and recurrent otitis media in the last year. She reported\n\n【42】ear fullness and swelling in the left EAC， and denied any ver-tigo or tinnitus. The otomicroscopic examination revealed a cystic mass occluding the left EAC. Pure-tone audiometry showed mixed moderate hearing loss， while the right one showed presbyacusis.\n\n【43】Computed tomography showed soft tissue occupying the EAC without bone erosion signs . These findings were confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging， excluding a con-nection with the facial nerve and parotid gland. Surgical treat-ment was planned，and excision of the lesion with canaloplas-ty and a Thiersch graft was performed. This was later found in the retroauricular region， where the surgeon performed a par-tial-thickness graft harvested with a knife. The skin was then cleaned，keeping only the epithelium and some papillary der-mis， and the thin graft was positioned to cover the bony canal.\n\n【44】A histopathological examination revealed a cystic lesion lined by cylindrical epithelium adjacent to the squamous cells. Hence， a diagnosis of type 1 first branchial arch malformative resi-dues was made .\n\n【45】After 9 months， the patient was disease-free， and pure-tone audiometry showed a mixed moderate hearing loss that did not worsen after surgical treatment. Therefore， she underwent radiological follow-up.\n\n【46】Discussion\n\n【47】FBCA is a congenital condition based on anomalies in the first branchial apparatus that develop into pharyngeal and oral struc-tures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.

FBCAs repre-sent 8% of all branchial cleft anomalies. Generally， they result from incomplete obliteration of the clefts that arise between the branchial arches during embryogenesis and are usually lo-cated in the neck with other otologic or pharyngeal locations通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>. Clinically， FBCAs are characterized by recurrent otor-rhea， pain in the parotid region， or a cervical mass anterior to the sternocleidomastoid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【51】In our case， the onset of the disease was unusual as it began in the patient at the age of 80 years， and symptoms were also uncommon， with swelling of the left EAC， without neck involve-ment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Despite the patient's age， no facial nerve involve-ment was reported.

In our study， magnetic resonance imaging ruled out any potential\n\n【53】relationship with the parotid gland and eventual connection with the neck. Still， it did not provide adequate information for a definite differential diagnosis in the presence of puru-lent otorrhea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Moreover， the exclusive EAC involvement ruled out any differential diagnosis with the malignant and benign parotid neoplasms and cysts， parotitis， second bran-chial cleft anomalies， and various pathological entities of the head and neck lymph nodes.\n\n【54】Surgery with total lesion removal was the only possible treat-ment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. A literature review showed that facial nerve le-sions are reported in 13% of cases， and the rate of recurrence is about 3%， with a correct diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【55】In the present case， histopathological examination surprising-ly revealed a first branchial cleft cyst due to the presence of cylindric epithelium that was not represented in the EAC. This made possible the differential diagnosis of an epidermoid cyst of the EAC. The cylindric epithelium is located only in the mid-dle ear and not outside when the tympanic membrane is intact.\n\n【56】Moreover， in the present case， the absence of respiratory epi-thelium and associated lymphoid tissue was fundamental for a differential diagnosis of second branchial cleft cysts.\n\n【57】Conclusions\n\n【58】This is the unique case of type 1 FBCA reported in an adult pa-tient that exclusively involved the EAC. This rare condition rep-resents a potential diagnostic option that should be consid-ered in the differential diagnosis of cysts of the EAC.\n\n【59】References：\n\n【60】1\\.

After 6 months， the patient came to the orthopedic clinic be-cause his symptoms were unimproved.\n\n【39】At physical examination， we determined edema and pain with palpation of the capitate bone. Wrist range of motion was nearly full but the final stage was tender. There was no ten-derness on scaphoid with palpation， Watson test， LT test， and Lichtman test results were negative. There was no evidence of compression of the median nerve.\n\n【40】Upon X-ray examination， we saw a transverse fracture line and sclerosis in the middle of the capitate . Computed to-mography (CT) clearly showed the nonunion . X-ray and CT failed to show any other pathology.\n\n【41】We advised the surgical treatment for nonunion. However， the patient rejected the surgery， so we put the wrist in a short-arm cast for 3 months. After the immobilization had been fi-nalized， range of motion and strengthening exercises were started. One year after the trauma， we saw total union of the fracture ， edema had completely regressed， wrist range of motion was full and painless \\[80° flexion， 70°exten-sion， 20°radial deviation， and 30° ulnar deviation\\] and grip strength was equal in both hands. The patient was followed for post-traumatic arthritis.\n\n【42】Discussion\n\n【43】Fractures of the capitate are a rare injury， especially in chil-dren， are usually missed entirely， and account for only 0.3%\n\n【44】of all carpal fractures. Most of these fractures occur in as-sociation with additional carpal injury， particularly scaphoid fractures. This is usually the result of a high energy trauma通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，17-19\\]</u>. Isolated capitate fractures usually occur after fall-ing on an open hand 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【45】Capitate fractures are often missed entirely because the ini-tial radiographies of nondisplaced fractures are usually nondi-agnostic. CT is very helpful for diagnosis of isolated fractures. MRI is helpful in showing avascular necrosis and for deciding whether there is union or nonunion 4，6\\].\n\n【46】The complication rate for capitate fractures is relatively high and consequences are important 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Functional limitation is common secondary to nonunion， avascular necrosis of the proximal pole， capitate collapse， symptomatic midcarpal ar-thritis， or associated injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【47】The outcome and the treatment modalities of isolated capi-tate fractures are not well determined. The orthopedists con-curred with conservative treatment with initial cast immobi-lization (generally 6 to 12 weeks of immobilization)， followed by mobilization within pain limits， because the displacement was minimal and the fracture fragment was small and not ro-tated 4，20\\].\n\n【48】Displaced fracture of the capitate requires anatomic reposition-ing and internal fixation with headless cannulated compres-sion screws or K-wires 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. The headless compression screw has advantage over the K-wire because it provides compres-sion across the fracture site and allows early wrist exercise 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.\n\n【49】References：\n\n【50】1\\.

In our case， after immobilization with a cast， we achieved union and excellent results. We treated our late-diagnosed capitate fracture case conservatively due to refus-al of surgical treatment by the patient. Union was achieved with cast immobilization after 3 months. At last examination. there was full range of wrist motion without pain.\n\n【65】Conclusions\n\n【66】Carpal bone fractures may be under-diagnosed， especially in skeletally immature patients. If complaints persist， control ra-diographies should be taken as soon as possible. If further examination is needed， CT should be performed. Surgery is the recommended treatment for nonunion of a capitate frac-ture.

Spinal tumor involvement is rarely seen， and its imaging findings are largely inconsistent because of the rarity of these cases. We present a case report of a 9-month-old girl with a rare intraspinal tumor with histologic evidence of SFT/HPC， but no STAT6 nuclear immunoreactivity. A 9-month-old girl， born at term with good prenatal care， presented to the emergency room with regression of developmental milestones. The patient was in good health until 2 months， when she developed decreased spontaneous leg movements. Physical exam revealed diffuse muscular atrophy， with no deep tendon reflexes， sensation， or spontaneous movements of the lower extremities. Computed tomography and magnetic reso-nance imaging showed a heterogeneous irregular mass filling the lumbosacral spinal canal， extending through the neural foramina to the prevertebral/perivertebral and presacral regions. The tumor was biopsied and re-ferred to the National Institutes of Health for consultation and the diagnosis of SFT/HPC was confirmed on the basis of its histologic features， despite the fact that the tumor was negative for STAT6 immunoreactivity.\n\n【19】Conclusions：\n\n【20】Although the tumor histology was consistent with SFT/HPC， it was negative for STAT6 nuclear immunoreactivi-ty， which is unusual and may exclude the diagnosis.

The patient's parents reported that about 1 week before ad-mission， the patient completely stopped moving her lower ex-tremities， and could no longer sit up or roll over. They also re ported frequent wet diapers and irritability. They denied loss of movement in her head， neck， or upper extremities. A neu-rological exam revealed diffuse muscular atrophy， along with absent deep tendon reflexes， sensation， and spontaneous movements of the lower extremities. The patient also had a decreased anal sphincter tone and an absent anal wink reflex The patient's trunk and upper extremities had adequate mus-cle tone， positive deep tendon reflexes， and no loss of sensa-tion or spontaneous movements.

There was subsequent mass effect and displacement of presacral vessels\n\n【35】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3.

Bilateral retroperitoneal in-volvement is seen extending just inferior to the inferior poles of the bilateral kidneys. The urinary bladder is displaced an-teriorly and appears elongated because of extrinsic compres-sion. There appears to be some degree of free intraperitone-al fluid .\n\n【37】On the basis of these imaging findings and taking into account the lesion's location and patient demographics， our initial dif-ferential diagnosis included neuroblastoma， chordoma， chon-drosarcoma， Ewing's sarcoma， and other sarcomatous lesions.\n\n【38】A whole-body metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy was requested by the pediatric oncologist. Posterior and an-terior whole-body MIBG scintigraphy using 370 MBq of io-dine-123 demonstrated normal physiologic MIBG uptake in brown fat， nasal mucosa， and salivary glands， heart， liver， and\n\n【39】bowel， with excretion activity in the bladder， excluding a di-agnosis of neuroblastoma .\n\n【40】Pathologic findings\n\n【41】An epidural/intervertebral disc biopsy was taken and referred to our pathology service. Upon histologic evaluation (hema-toxylin-eosin stain， original magnification x100) we observed monotonous sheets of spindle cells with abundant dilated“staghorn” vessels . Higher magnification (hema-toxylin-eosin stain， original magnificationx400) showed mo-notonous spindle cells， with minimal cytologic atypia and no mitosis .\n\n【42】On immunohistochemistry evaluation， the tumor stained pos-itive for CD56， CD99， S100， and vimentin， whereas it was neg-ative for CD34， Bcl-2， synaptophysin， chromogranin， desmin，\n\n【43】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4. The tumor is composed of monotonous sheets of spindle cells with abundant dilated“staghorn” vessels(hematoxylin and eosin，×100).</u>\n\n【44】actin， and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). Phosphohistone H3 and Ki67 staining protocols were consistent with a low pro-liferative index， reporting 3 mitoses in 10/HPF and low (up to10% of cells in some areas) proliferation， respectively. The di-agnostic impression was of a spindle cell lesion with features of SFT/HPC with inconclusive immunohistochemistry.\n\n【45】Given that our institution does not perform the STAT6 immu-noreactivity protocol， the case was referred to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for consultation. NIH evaluation con-firmed the diagnosis of SFT/HPC on the basis of histologic fea-tures， despite having a negative STAT6 nuclear immunoreactivity.\n\n【46】After the diagnosis was received and discussed with pediatric oncologists， the patient was transferred to another hospital center in the U.S. mainland for specialized management and treatment options. Hence， further management and follow-up information is not available.\n\n【47】Discussion\n\n【48】SFTs and HPCs are rare mesenchymal tumors that were initial-ly described as separate entities； however， because of similar pathologic characteristics they were recently merged under a single classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Even though these tumors can arise in any part of the body， they are uncommonly found in the cen-tral nervous system (CNS)， located above the tentorium， around the pineal gland， or extending from the spinal cord meninges. In fact， patients with spinal SFTs/HPCs are commonly middle-aged and complain of motor and sensory symptoms unique to the tumor location 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In the majority of the previously re-ported cases the tumor arises from the thoracic spine，involv-ing the intradural extramedullary compartments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【49】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5. Higher magnification showed monotonous spindle cells with minimal cytologic atypia and no mitosis(hematoxylin and eosin，×400).</u>\n\n【50】Spinal SFTs/HPCs rarely appear on imaging studies in the cur-rent literature. When this tumor is suspected， CT may aid in diagnosis， but MRI with intravenous gadolinium contrast is more commonly used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. On imaging， SFT/HPC of the CNS can be found as an oval or irregular heterogeneous mass extend-ing from the dural planes with well- or ill-defined margins on CT or MRI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. When infiltration of adjacent structures such as vertebrae or soft tissues occurs， the tumor margins may be ill defined and could be indicative of malignant variants of the disease. Regions of patchy hypoattenuation are likely caused by ischemia from inadequate blood supply to the tumor cen-ter. When a spinal lesion with these features is identified， it should be differentiated from common spinal lesions including meningiomas or nerve sheath tumors such as schwannomas. A schwannoma usually presents as a well-defined dumbbell-shaped spinal lesion， typically heterogeneously hyperintense on T2-weighted images with areas of cystic degeneration and contrast enhancement. Meningiomas commonly appear isoin-tense relative to the spinal cord on both T1-and T2-weighted images， with a homogeneous enhancement pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【51】Particularly in the pediatric popu lation， a neuroblastoma should be considered， as it is the most common extracranial solid tu-mor in childhood and the most frequently diagnosed neoplasm during infancy. In the majority of cases， a neuroblastoma oc-curs within the abdomen， but may present along the paraspi-nal region， extending into the neural foramina， causing com-pression of nerve roots and of the spinal cord 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【52】Before the World Health Organization (WHO)'s revision of SFT/HPC， some studies attempted to characterize the imaging fea-tures of SFT and HPC separately， with conflicting results dem-onstrating a wide range of tumoral MR signal intensities and enhancement patterns 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Current unified WHO guidelines\n\n【53】state that SFT/HPC demonstrate isointensity on T1-weighted MRl and high or mixed signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI. However， in our case we observed a heterogeneous signal on T1-weighted images， as well as a mixed and predominantly hyperintense signal on the T2-weighted images.\n\n【54】Diagnostic confirmation of CNS SFT/HPC is currently achieved through the combination of histologic and immunohistochem-ical analysis. On histomorphologic assessment， these tumors are highly vascular and characteristically display a prominent irregularbranching pattern known as staghorn vessels. In ad-dition， these tumors may present with varying degrees of cel-lularity of spindled to ovoid tumor cells and scant cytoplasm within a collagenous stroma. Although the majority of SFTs exhibit a benign histology and behavior， atypical malignant forms can occur. The malignant criteria should be advocated by a high mitotic count， increased cellularity， hemorrhage or necrosis， pleomorphic nuclei， and foci of dedifferentiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\nImmunohistochemistry with existing markers has been of vari-able value in making a definitive diagnosis. Beside the sug-gestive histomorphologic features，SFT/HPC tumors have been formerly diagnosed by the frequent coexpression of CD34， Bcl-2， and CD99 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Generally， the most characteristic immuno-histochemical marker is CD34， present in 95% of cases； how-ever， CD34 reactivity can be absent or only focally present in some atypical cases of SFTs or expressed in other benign mes-enchymal tumors or sarcomas 12|.\n\n【56】The other markers commonly identified yet variably expressed in SFTs include CD99， Bcl-2， nuclear B-catenin， and EMA. All these markers are nonspecific and could be positive in other soft-tissue tumors that may mimic SFTs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. SFTs may also rarely stain for S100， cytokeratin or desmin and differential diagnosis in such cases may include a wide variety of spindle cell tumors primarily of fibroblastic/myofibroblastic or periph-eral nerve sheath lineage. In contrast，immunohistochemical nuclear expression for the upregulated STAT6 protein， which resu lts from a gene fusion event on chromosome 12， has been previously recognized in many studies as a highly sensitive and specific immunohistochemical marker for SFT/HPC， being useful to distinguish this tumor type from histologic mimics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，12\\]</u>.\n\n【57】Currently， SFTs/HPCs are classified in a three-tier grading sys-tem that aids in determining treatment algorithms. In this clas-sification， grade I tumors are highly collagenous and have ar-eas alternating between hypocellularity and hypercellularity. Grade Il tumors are characterized by high cellularity， reticu-lar fibers， and scarce collagenous structures. Grade IIl tumors have similar histologic characteristics to grade ll， but demon-strate anaplasia， with >5 mitoses per 10 high-power fields 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【58】In our case， histologic evaluation of the specimen revealed a highly cellular tumor with monotonous sheets of spindle cells， a low amount of collagen， and thin-walled branching vessels in a staghorn pattern. These histologic findings were consis-tent with a grade Il SFT/HPC.\n\n【59】On immunohistochemistry analysis our specimen was CD99positive. However， it was 5100 positive and negative for both CD34 and Bcl-2 markers， which is an uncommon immunopro-file for SFT/HPC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Furthermore， our specimen was also neg-ative for STAT6 nuclear protein immunoreactivity， which is re-markably unusual for SFT/HPC tumors. Although a negative nuclear protein immunoreactivity is sufficient to exclude the diagnosis， it may be lost in cases of dedifferentiated SFTs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【60】In a recent study validating the STAT6 immunoreactivity by Tan et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>， the majority of STAT6-negative tumors suspect-ed to represent SFTs were reclassified， with alternative diagno-ses supported by additional immunohistochemical or molecu-lar studies. In their study， reclassification of the STAT6-negative tumors revealed some common mimics of SFT/HPC that they recommend be considered in the differential diagnosis in the pediatric population. These were fibroblastic or myofibroblas-tic tumors， nerve sheath/neural tumors， sex cord stromal tu-mors， and poorly differentiated small round blue cell tumors. Histologically， each of these tumors demonstrated focal to dif-fuse areas comprised of spindle cell proliferations with vari-ably collagenous backgrounds and focal HPC-like features. In fact， they concluded that SFT is an overly diagnosed tumor in the pediatric population and encouraged the use of STAT6 nu-clear stain as confirmatory for its diagnosis.\n\n【61】A review by Geramizadeh et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> analyzes the role of im-munohistochemistry in the diagnosis of SFTs， states that a double-negative CD34 and Bcl-2 tumor (as in our case) makes the diagnosis of SFT highly unlikely， and that to call a tumor SFT， a CD34 marker should be positive. They considered that the only exception would be in malignant and dedifferentiat-ed cases， pertinent to the pathologic analysis in our case that demonstrated minimal cytologic atypia without reaching the criteria for a malignant tumor.\n\n【62】Conclusions\n\n【63】This case makes it clear that correlating the radiological char-acteristics of a tumor with its pathologic findings and biolog-ical behavior still remains a challenge. First of all， our case is particularly rare in that the histologic characteristics showed features classically attributed to SFTs/HPCs， which was unex-pected for the patient's age group. In addition， the cytologic analysis showed a completely discordant immunohistochemical profile that is of a debatable diagnosis in the current literature.\n\n【64】To our knowledge， this is the youngest patient to present with a spinal tumor with these pathologic features.\n\n【65】The pathologic challenges encountered in this case report sug-gest that future studies are still needed to clarify the biological nature of the immunohistochemical marker of these tumors. Even though a rare presentation of a STAT6-negative SFT/HPC was the final diagnosis in this case， additional studies should\n\n【66】References：\n\n【67】1\\.

This case report is of an incidental finding of a JI-NET in a patient who was previously misdiagnosed with scle-rosing mesenteritis.\n\n【25】Case Report：\n\n【26】A 42-year-old man was admitted to our institution with diffuse abdominal pain and clinical and radiographic signs of bowel obstruction. He had a previous diagnosis of sclerosing mesenteritis， which had been histolog-ically diagnosed after an exploratory laparoscopy performed in 2009 for recurrent acute abdominal pain. He was also annually monitored through computed tomography scans for an incidentally discovered， gradually enlarging mesenteric mass for which a \"wait and watch” management approach was adopted. After a period of fasting and observation， the patient underwent an urgent exploratory laparotomy because of his worsening condition. Intraoperatively， an ileocecal resection was performed， along with excision of the known mesenter-ic mass. The pathology report revealed an ileal NET with nodal metastases within the mesentery and mesen-teric tumor deposits (pT3N1).\n\n【27】Conclusions： JI-NETs are rare entities， which are usually encountered as incidental findings or in patients with unspecific ab-dominal pain. Our case represents a probable delayed diagnosis of JI-NET in the context of sclerosing mesen-teritis； therefore， a possible association between these 2 conditions should be investigated.\n\n【28】Keywords： Fibrosis · Gastrointestinal Neoplasms· Neuroendocrine Tumors · Panniculitis， Peritoneal\n\n【29】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/931372\n\n【30】日22646 盟2 山可甘3 23\n\n【31】A neuroendocrine tumor (NET) is a rare entity that occurs most-ly in the gastrointestinal tract， especially in the small bowel. Jejunoileal neuroendocrine tumors (JI-NETs) comprise the sec-ond largest subgroup of NETs of the gastrointestinal system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. JI-NETs have an incidence of 0.67 to 0.81 per 100 000 persons per year and are usually diagnosed in patients between the ages of 60 and 65 years， with no difference in occurrence be-tween men and women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Diagnosis is often challengingbe-cause JI-NETs are typically found as an incidental finding in asymptomatic patients or in the clinical setting of unspecific abdominal symptoms. Advanced cases can present as large tumors that cause intestinal obstruction or as carcinoid syn-drome in the case of metastatic disease.\n\n【32】Here， we report an incidental ly discovered JI-NET with nodal metastasis in a patient with a history of sclerosing mesenteritis.\n\n【33】Case Report\n\n【34】A 42-year-old man was referred to our Emergency Department in July 2020 with diffuse abdominal pain， emesis， and 3 days since last passing feces or flatus.\n\n【35】The patient had a medical history of hypertension， untreated type 2 diabetes， and chronic Helicobacter Pylori-related gastri-tis. He did not have a history of alcohol abuse or dependence but had formerly smoked 10 cigarettes daily for about 15years. Previous surgeries included tonsillectomy during child-hood and a diagnostic laparoscopy in 2009.\n\n【36】The latter was performed for acute abdominal pain when a mass was found at the root of the mesentery and biopsied. The mass was classified as a sclerotic and fibromatous tis-sue， with chronic inflammation consisting of giant cells， mac-rophages， and necrosis， consistent with a diagnosis of scleros ing mesenteritis. Oncological markers CA19.9， CEA， and AFP were negative and thus a radiologica. follow-up with annual computed tomography (CT) was indicated as well as therapy with prednisone and tamoxifen.\n\n【37】A persistent finding was the mesenteric mass in the mesogas-trium， measuring 5x7 cm and consisting of parenchymatous-like tissue， without remarkable contrast enhancement (last CT was on April 8， 2020). The patient was also routinely evaluated for nutritional difficulties and persistence of nausea and vom-iting. He had a positron emission tomography (PET) scan on January 1， 2020， which showed hyperfixation of the mesogas-tric lesion and of a previously unrecognized lesion of the left colon. Because of these findings， colonoscopy was planned but not completed due to a lack of adequate intestinal preparation.\n\n【38】Between February and June 2020， the patient reported weight loss of 20 to 25 kg and recurrent episodes of acute abdominal pain， which he managed with antiemetics and pain medication.\n\n【39】On July 8， 2020， he underwent an urgent abdominal CT scan. A solid mass measuring 5x7 cm and strictly attached to the ileal loop was confirmed at the root of the mesentery， causing its compression and upstream distension . Fasting and close observation were initially chosen as the therapeu-tic approach. The next day， an urgent exploratory laparotomy was indicated because of the patient's worsening condition.\n\n【40】Intraoperative findings included a largely distended small bowel， which was adhered to the mesenteric root mass. The surgeon performed a thorough evaluation of the small intes-tine from the ligament of Treitz to the ileocecal valve， without identifying other pathological findings. A complete resection of the mesenteric mass was performed， along with resection of the cecum，appendix， and the last ileal loop， as these struc-tures were firmly adhered to the mass. No other findings were reported， and an intraoperative colonoscopy excluded endo-luminal masses and any signs of macroscopic lesions. A lat-erolateral mechanical ileocolonic anastomosis was fashioned without fecal diversion.\n\n【41】The histological examination highlighted a nodular retract-ing mesenteric mass measuring 8.5x6.5×7 cm that twisted the bowel loops because of fibrotic adhesion. The mass was irregularly shaped and light colored， had a hard consistency， and was composed of a mixture of vascular structures， myx-oid areas， and calcified spots.\n\n【42】Another irregularly shaped， yellowish， hard area measuring 1.6cm was described in the intestinal loops in connection with the sclerosing mesentery. Pathological examination revealed an NET of the ileum (NET-G1) with Ki67 <3% invading through-out the intestinal wall. The nearby mesentery was intensely sclerotic， with a microscopic examination confirming a strong chronic fibrotic and inflammatory reaction with few plasma cells and lymphocytes and occasionally lgG4+ plasma cells. NET deposits were found in the sclerosing mesentery .\n\n【43】Amid the fibrotic reaction， 12 lymph nodes were encountered，2 of which had a positive result for tumoral cells. This NET was thus classified as pT3N1， stage Ill， according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system .\n\n【44】The postoperative course was characterized by the absence of surgical complications， yet it was complicated by neuro-logical distress， which was diagnosed as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. The patient was treated with intravenous vitamin supplements and， on postoperative day 25， he was transferred to a neurological clinic for rehabilitation for about 30 days.\n\n【45】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

Therefore， a final diagnosis is complex， also because there are no specific labo-ratory findings for sclerosing mesenteritis.\n\n【58】Imaging tests are helpful in diagnosing sclerosing mesenteritis because the condition has several specific radiological signs.\n\n【59】In 2011， Coulier et al defined 5 signs on CT that are specific for this disease： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> mesenteric mass causing mass effect on nearby structures without any sign of invasion； 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> high atten-uation； 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> mesenteric fat containing small nodes； 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>“fat halo sign\" or “fat ring sign\" as a hypoattenuating sign that surrounds the lymph nodes or the mesenteric vessels without their en-casement； and 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> a hyperattenuating sign of a pseudo-cap-sule that encircles the mesenteric mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，6\\]</u>. However， once a diagnosis is made， choosing the proper treatment course is controversial， with several case reports and small series having established medical treatment with corticosteroids，tamoxifen， thalidomide， and azathioprine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.Nonetheless， there are cas-es ofinvolvement of the mesenteric vasculature and intestinal loops by the mass which indicate surgery， especially if there is bowel ischemia or obstruction， as in our present case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【60】NETs consist of a heterogeneous group of tumors with differ-ent morphologies and functions.

Most of these tumors occur in the gastrointestinal tract (55%) and in the bronchopulmonary system (25%)； gastrointestinal NETs are often detected in the small bowel (45%) but can also be detected in the rectum (20%)， appendix (16%)， colon (11%)， and stomach (7%).\n\n【61】JI-NETs are the most common type of small bowel NETs and occur at a mean patient age of 60 to 70 years， without sex pre-dilection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Most JI-NETs are nonfunctioning， and therefore their clinical presentation can be unspecific. JI-NETs are usually detected incidentally in asymptomatic patients or in patients with generic abdominal pain， weight loss， and fatigue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2，9\\]</u>. A rare presentation is with obstructive symptoms (nausea and vomiting)，bleeding， or perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Rare cases of specific\n\n【62】clinical presentation usually occur with metastatic disease or functioning JI-NETs， where there is an excess of hormonal se-cretion by neuroendocrine tumoral cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，11\\]</u>.\n\n【63】JI-NETs are usually small and slow-growing tumors and are therefore classified as indolent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. However， at the time of diagnosis， 70% of JI-NETs have invaded the muscularis propria and include nodal metastasis， and another 50% can have he-patic metastasis regardless of tumor dimension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【64】Laboratory markers， such as serum chromogranin A (CgA)， se-rum neuron-specific enolase (NSE)， and urinary 5-hydroxy in-dole acetic acid (5-HIAA)， are used to help in the diagnosis ofJI-NETs.CgA and NSE are specific for neuroendocrine cells， while5-HIAA is specific for serotonin metabolism； therefore， its use is limited to carcinoid syndrome or metastatic disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，12\\]</u>. CgA is produced by all types of NETs， including those that are nonfunctioning. CgA is a specific and sensitive marker of NET because its production is correlated with tumor dimension and prognosis. It has been reported that higher CgA levels in-dicate a worse prognosis， perhaps because it is correlated with a higher tumor volume 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2，13\\]</u>.\n\n【65】Imaging techniques are useful to assess the location of the tu-mor and to allow for its staging. CT and MRl are useful tools even if there is an unknown primary tumor with evidence of nodal involvement and/or distant metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Other im-aging techniques include the functional studies such as so-matostatin receptor imaging， namely gallium-68-PET and indium-111-SPECT. It is reported that the combination of gal-lium-68-PET with CT scanning improves sensibility in an addi-tional 20% to 30% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【66】Definitive diagnosis of JI-NET is histological. The mitotic index and calculation of the Ki67 index are prognostically important in JI-NETs， since they are classified according to the European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (ENETS)， International Union Against Cancer (UICC)， and AJCC systems through tumor，node， metastasis (TNM) staging and Ki67 grading 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> .\n\n【67】JI-NETs are inclined to produce a desmoplastic reaction that leads to strong fibrosis in the mesentery； simultaneously， a mesenteric mass that is also in enlarged regional lymph nodes can be detected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，14\\]</u>.\n\n【68】The desmoplastic reaction can cause mesenteric fibrosis， as was shown for the first time in 1961 by Moertel et al， who also determined its association with increased morbidity and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. This process can expand to the retroperitoneal space， causing retroperitoneal fibrosis， obstructive uropathy， and hydronephrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Mesenteric fibrosis can also cause mesenteric retraction， resulting in the kinking of the intestinal loops， followed by intestinal obstruction. The fibrotic process\n\n【69】can also entail the mesenteric blood vessels， causing intesti-nal ischemia in 10% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16，17\\]</u>. Mesenteric fibrosis as-sociated with JI-NETs is regarded as an independent negative prognostic factor， as it is associated with distant metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【70】Standard treatment of JI-NETs is oncologic resection of the tumor with locoregional lymphadenectomy proximal to the branches departing from the superior mesenteric vessel and resection of the eventual mesenteric fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. It is impor-tant to fully explore the abdominal cavity to check for perito-neal carcinomatosis， which is present in 20% cases with no symptoms， and to perform a complete manual palpation of the small bowel from the ligament of Treitz to the ileocecal valve通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. The criterion standard technique is a diagnostic laparot-omy. Laparoscopy can be considered as an alternative，even though the guidelines from Europe and North America do not recommend it， considering the small size of NETs and the pos-sibility of a multifocal nature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18，19\\]</u>.\n\n【71】More than 80% of cases have regional nodal metastasis； there-fore， regional lymphadenectomy is advisable in all patients. ENETs guidelines emphasize the importance of curative re-section of the JI-NETs， together with dissection of locoregion-al nodes along the superior mesenteric pedicle and within the mesentery， as this improves the 5-year and 10-year sur-vival rates to 100%，95%， and 80% for stages l， ll， and Ill， re-spectively. RO resection is an important prognostic factor in locoregional cancer (stages I-IIl)， whereas other important in-dependent prognostic factors in survival are patient age and disease stage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，19，20\\]</u>.\n\n【72】In addition to being associated with standard nodal metasta-sis， up to 60% of JI-NETs are associated with mesenteric tu-mor deposits (MTDs)， which are defined as irregular mesenteric tumoral nodules that are discontinuous from the primary NET通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，21\\]</u>. MTDs can also be associated with an intense mesen-teric reaction， which can cause obstruction or ischemia.MTDs are also considered as an adverse prognostic factor， since they are associated with liver metastasis and a poor general prog-nosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Follow-up typically consists of blood tests and clin-ical and radiological examination every 6 months for the first year， then annually for a decade.\n\n【73】In our present case， the patient was previously diagnosed with sclerosing mesenteritis elsewhere and was therefore treated medically. Symptoms of nausea and fatigue had been vague and episodic over the years， until the intestinal ob-struction occurred. The abdominal CT scan was not sufficient to allow for a correct diagnosis， since it only confirmed the presence of the mesenteric mass in addition to the radiolog-ical signs of obstruction. Given that the patient came to our Emergency Department because of the abdominal clinical pre-sentation， the priority was to treat the intestinal obstruction，\n\n【74】Table 1.

During the procedure， the entire small bowel was evaluated to find the cause of the obstruction. Mesenteric fibrosis was encoun-tered， and the mesenteric mass was found to be responsible； however， at that time， there was no suspicion of a malignancy since the intraoperative colonoscopy did not reveal any mac-roscopic lesions. In this patient， only the histological exami-nation enabled us to make the diagnosis of the JI-NET with nodal metastasis and MTDs. The real challenge with this pa-tient was understanding whether the preexisting mesenteric\n\n【83】fibrosis was independent or if it was derived from the adja-cent NET. We found afterward that the strong fibrotic reaction that is associated with NETs can mislead a correct diagnosis， since MTDs can radiologically mimic sclerosing mesenteritis， as stated above. Both MTDs and sclerosing mesenteritis can appear as a mesenteric mass with radiating fibrotic bands in a stellate or wheel pattern； the main difference is that MTDs tend to encase and infiltrate mesenteric vessels， while scleros-ing mesenteritis creates the \"fat ring sign\" as described above because it surrounds vessels without invading them 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，23\\]</u>. In our present case， the abdominal CT scan that was performed in an urgent setting revealed that the mesenteric mass Was well-defined， spiculated， and hyperattenuating， compared with the adjacent mesenteric fat， and slightly inhomogeneous with some calcifications. It had caused compression on the near-by intestinal loops and mesenteric vessels， without infiltrating them. Of the 5 CT signs described by Coulier et al， the mass of this patient had 2 of them， hence the diagnostic difficulty in discriminating sclerosing mesenteritis from the fibrotic mes-enteritis associated with JI-NETs.\n\n【84】References：\n\n【85】1\\.

Here， we report a case of delayed diagnosis of JI-NET in a con-text of sclerosing mesenteritis. Since sclerosing mesenteritis is usually a diagnosis of exclusion， we want to focus on the importance of considering small bowel NETs in all cases of fi-brotic mesenteritis. Furthermore， it is widely reported in the literature that mesenteritis is usually a sequela of the NET en-vironment. Moreover， we think that the pathophysiologic cor-relation between mesenteritis and NETs needs to be better defined to support this complex diagnosis.\n\n【99】12\\. Scott AT， Howe JR.

Early diagnosis and surgical detorsion are required to restore blood flow and limit tissue damage.\n\n【20】Case Report：\n\n【21】Here， we present a case of ovarian torsion and appendicitis in an 11-year-old premenarchal girl who present-ed to our emergency room with a 4-day history of right iliac fossa pain， limping， and fever. Upon initial eval-uation in our hospital， her vital signs were stable and clinical examination revealed abdominal guarding and right lower quadrant rebound tenderness with positive Rovsing's sign. Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography scans showed adnexal cysts and torsion， an inflamed appendix， and free fluid in the abdomen. Intraoperative findings included a twisted gangrenous ovary and an edematous appendix. The patient under-went emergency laparoscopic oophorectomy and appendectomy.\n\n【22】Conclusions：\n\n【23】This case demonstrates that reactive appendicitis can occur secondary to inflammation of adjacent structures such as the ovary.\n\n【24】Keywords： Adolescent ·Appendicitis·Ovary\n\n【25】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/932245\n\n【26】口11516 H\n\n【27】2\n\n【28】￥16\n\n【29】Ovarian torsion is defined as a rare gynecologic emergency oc-curring as the ovary twists on its ligamentous support， which obstructs the blood flow to the ovaries. There is no specific diagnosis of this condition in the form of clinical presentation in pediatric cases. Moreover， there might be inconsistency or equivocality in diagnostic imaging through computed tomogra-phy， magnetic resonance imaging， and Doppler ultrasound 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The occurrence of ovarian torsion is rare among children and adolescents； however， it is important to consider pediatric fe-males with abdominal pain.\n\n【30】Approximately 2 out of 10 000 pediatric and adolescent pop-ulations are affected by this disease， which constitutes 15%of all torsion cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The occurrence of torsion is observed among pre-and post-menarchal girls.\n\n【31】Adnexal torsion can affect otherwise healthy ovaries， known as torsion of the normal adnexa， or pathologic adnexa， which typically contains ovarian or para-ovarian cysts. Among the pe-diatric and adolescent populations， most of the torsion cases(40-84%) develop because of some ovarian pathology， where-as other cases demonstrate torsion of normal adnexa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>.It is expected that torsion in post-menarchal teens is linked with functional ovarian cysts like the cysts of the corpus luteum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【32】The risk of recurrent torsion is associated with the underlying pathology that causes torsion. Previous studies have shown that 60% of the recurrence rate in pre-and post-menarchal females is associated with normal adnexa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. Moreover， these cases present a chance of preventing recurrent torsion by ovarian fixation of the ipsilateral and bilateral adnexa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【33】Here， we describe an uncommon case of a delayed diagno-sis of ovarian torsion complicated by reactive appendicitis.\n\n【34】Case Report\n\n【35】An 11-year-old pre-pubertal girl with no past medical or sur-gical history presented to our ED with a 4-day history of right iliac fossa pain and limping associated with fever. Before this， she presented to the ED of another hospital on 2 occasions and was discharged after being diagnosed with suspected gastro-enteritis or early acute appendicitis. Physical examination of the abdomen revealed guarding and right lower quadrant re-bound tenderness with positive Rovsing's sign and Dunphy's sign. The laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 12.79x10°/L with 65.9% neutrophils.\n\n【36】Abdominal ultrasound suggested an ovarian torsion (right ovarian cyst of 4.5x4 cm) with a minimal amount of free fluid\n\n【37】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1. Coronal view of the abdominal and pelvic CT with intravenous contrast showing (A) an appendix with a thickened enhancing edemato us wall in the right iliac fossa measuring about 10 mm in diameter； (B) moderate free fluid in the right iliac fossa， hepatorenal pouch， and pelvic region； (C) right adnexal cystic structure with septation， hyperdense component， and thickened wall， measuring about 6.5x4.8 cm.</u>\n\n【38】in the pouch of Douglas. As the appendix was not visualized， she underwent a CT scan with intravenous contrast. This re-vealed an appendix with a thickened enhancing edematous wall in the right iliac fossa extending medially with its tip\n\n【39】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2. Axial view of the abdominal and pelvic CT with intravenous contrast showing (A) an appendix with thickened enhancing edematous wall in the right iliac fossa measuring about 10 mm in diameter；(B) moderate free fluid in the right iliac fossa， hepatorenal pouch， and pelvic region； (C) right adnexal cystic structure with septation， hyperdense component，</u>\n\n【40】and thickened wall， measuring about 6.5x4.8 cm.\n\n【41】lying adjacent to the anterolateral aspect of the right ovari-an complex cyst. The inflamed appendix measured about 10mm in diameter and was associated with stranding and haz-iness of the mesenteric fat planes and moderate free fluid in the right iliac fossa， hepatorenal pouch， and pelvic region， sug-gestive of acute appendicitis with possible rupture. The right adnexa showed a cystic structure with septation and a hyper-dense component as well as a thickened wall， measuring ap-proximately 6.5x4.8 cm with endometrial fluid .\n\n【42】The patient underwent laparoscopic oophorectomy of the right ovary and appendectomy. Intraoperatively， there was a hem-orrhagic twisted ovarian torsion.\n\n【43】The wound was closed in layers using Vicry! 3/0 for the sheath and Vicry! rapid 4/0 for the skin. The wound was covered and the Foley catheter was removed. The total blood loss was 10mL and the patient did not require a blood transfusion. The appendix and hemorrhagic torsion were sent for pathological analysis. Histopathological examination revealed marked con-gested and non-viable tissue with hemorrhagic infarction， and no residual ovarian tissue， cyst， or malignancy. The appendix was inflamed distally with full-thickness necrosis at the tip. The patient recovered without complications.\n\n【44】Ethical consideration\n\n【45】Consent was obtained from the parents of the patient before continuing with this case study.\n\n【46】An infrequent cause of abdominal pain arises as the result of ovarian torsion among the pediatric female population. There is a rare occurrence of ovarian torsion with concomitant ap pendicitis. Physical exam ultrasonography， radiographs， and computed tomography are used as a diagnostic modality for these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The outcomes seem to be good in patients who undergo appendectomy and oophorectomy with or with-out a salpingectomy. A cystic ovarian lesion is present in 5 out of 7 cases， while 1 out of 7 cases present with ovarian neo-plasm in pathologic analysis. The present case is unique， with no identification of coexisting ovarian pathology.\n\n【47】Previous studies have shown that sonography and computed tomography are widely used for the diagnosis of ovarian tor-sion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，11\\]</u>. The major ultrasonic signs of the development of ovarian torsion include multiple follicles in cortical portions of the ovary and pelvic masses that may be with or without fluid in the pouch of Douglas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In the present case， there was no flow to the torsed ovary observed through duplex im-aging. It is possible to differentiate between appendicitis and ovarian torsion through ultrasonography with color Doppler. The 2 main issues highlighted by the present case study are that reactive appendicitis can occur secondary to inflamma-tion of adjacent structures such as the ovary， and that adnex-al torsion should be considered in the differential diagnosis of reactive appendicitis， and a surgeon skilled in managing both conditions should be consulted.\n\n【48】A similar case study by Al-Turki 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> described a delayed di-agnosis of ovarian torsion in a patient presenting with vom-iting and sudden onset of right iliac fossa pain. On initial ex-amination， the patient was tender in the right iliac fossa but without rebound tenderness； therefore， an initial diagnosis of appendicitis was made. However， after 17 hours of delay， this case was successfully managed with detorsion of the ovary after clinical imaging revealed a normal appendix. This case demonstrated the overlapping clinical features of appendici-tis and ovarian torsion.\n\n【49】Another cause of a reproductive-age woman was present-ed by Callen et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>， who presented with a history of sub-acute lower abdominal pain that became worse with phys-ical activity， and a low-grade fever. Ultrasound revealed an edematous ovary but ovarian torsion was considered unlike-ly. However， magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed a twisted vascular pedicle and demonstrated a markedly dilat-ed， hyper-enhancing appendix with extensive inflammatory changes involving the surrounding peritoneal fat as well as the small and large bowel. Abdominal examination revealed minimal periumbilical tenderness without any guarding or re-bound tenderness. She consented to diagnostic laparoscopy\n\n【50】for possible appendectomy； however， the intraoperative assess-ment revealed features of chronic appendicitis with dense ad-hesions precluding safe appendectomy. The ovary was edem-atous due to inflammation from chronic appendicitis without any torsion or ovarian mass. In conclusion， this was ovarian edema due to adjacent appendicitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【51】A rare case of pediatric ovarian torsion in a premenarchal13-year-old gir. was reported by Rajwani and Mahomed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. This case presented with engorged massive edematous and hemorrhagic ovarian torsion treated with salpingo-oophorec-tomy. This case was similar to our own in having a clinical pre-sentation with features of acute appendicitis and similar his-topathology results.\n\n【52】Adnexal torsion is most common among women aged 20-30years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Even though adnexal torsion is rare in premenar-chal girls 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>， it should be ruled out in patients presenting with signs and symptoms of an acute abdomen， such as those with suspected renal colic and acute appendicitis. Distinguishing between these 2 clinical entities may be challenging due to the overlapping signs and symptoms； therefore， ultrasound should be obtained to confirm the clinical diagnosis and pre-vent misdiagnosis. According to a previous study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>， young girls presenting with lower abdominal pain should undergo an ultrasound to rule out adnexal torsion and prevent poten-tially irreversible damage to the ovaries. In our case，ovarian torsion was evident on ultrasound； however， a previous study reported that ultrasound was insufficient to detect ovarian tor-sion in a woman of reproductive age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. However， our pa-tient also underwent a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis， which highlights the need for further research to evaluate whether ultrasound should always be complemented by more detailed imaging modalities such as CT or MRI.\n\n【53】The coincidence of ovarian pathology with appendicitis is rare； however， it can require surgery in some pediatric female pa-tients. It is often possible to secure the torsioned ovary， but there is a need to perform ovarian sparing whenever possi-ble. The present case reveals that ovarian torsion accompa-nied with appendicitis often requires salpingo-oophorectomy along with an appendectomy.\n\n【54】Conclusions\n\n【55】Ovarian torsion in pediatric patients has a similar clinical pre-sentation and may be treated by laparoscopy in most cases. This present case study showed that reactive appendicitis can occur secondary to inflammation of adjacent structures such as the ovary. It is shown that there is an increased risk of torsion recurrence among premenarchal girls with torsion involving normal adnexa that should be followed accordingly. This case\n\n【56】highlights the need for further studies to evaluate the sensi-tivity and specificity of ultrasound alone in detecting compli-cated adnexal torsion in adolescent girls.\n\n【57】Name of Department and Institution Where Work Was Done\n\n【58】Emergency Department， King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz University Hospital， Riyadh， Saudi Arabia.\n\n【59】References：\n\n【60】1\\.

Disruption of the normal healthy bacteria in the colon can lead to development of C. difficile colitis. Risk factors for C. difficile infections (CDI)include recent antibiotic exposure， hospital or nursing home stays， inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)， or impaired immunity. There is an increas-ing incidence of community-associated CDI (CA-CDI) in individuals without the common risk factors， which has implicated natural reservoirs， zoonoses， originating from animals such as domestic cats and dogs， livestock， shellfish， and wild animals.\n\n【19】Case Report： A previously healthy 31-year-old woman with recurrent CA-CDI suspected to be acquired from a household cat represents a novel presentation. The patient had an initial case of severe diarrhea following recent antibi-otic exposure， was briefly monitored in hospital， and was diagnosed with CDI. She was trialed on oral vanco-mycin， which resulted in temporary resolution of her symptoms. Her symptoms recurred， however， and did not improve despite treatment with multiple therapeutic options over a period of months. Ultimately， the patient was not able to achieve long-term resolution of her symptoms until her newly adopted pet cat was treated by a veterinarian.\n\n【20】Conclusions： In conclusion， this case report explores the epidemiologic risk factors of zoonotic CA-CDI and the importance of early identification， evaluation， and prevention of disease. This case demonstrates the significance of thor-ough history taking， contact (pet) tracing， and proper treatment of recurrent CA-CDI.\n\n【21】Keywords： Bacterial Zoonoses ·Clostridium Infections ·Diarrhea ·Disease Reservoirs\n\n【22】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/940923\n\n【23】Publisher's note： All daims expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of their affiliated\n\n【24】AP\n\n【25】organizations， or those of the publisher the editors and the reviewers.

Understanding the interactions be-tween the human host， the host's environment， and the in-fectious agent is the key to this case . Recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) from a household cat represents a novel presentation of CA-CDI， which， by defini-tion， refers to CDI in an individual with no overnight stay in an inpatient healthcare facility in the 12 weeks prior to symp-tom onset 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Case Report\n\n【28】A 31-year-old woman presented with a l-week history of fe-ver and diarrhea. She reported passing 4 loose， non-bloody bowel movements daily， associated with abdominal cramps， nausea， and vomiting. Medical history included endometrio-sis and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). Her most re-cent UTI was treated with a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin，com-pleted 3 days prior to admission. This was her only antibiotic exposure within the previous 3 months. She denied any pre-vious hospitalizations， surgeries， prior CDl， other enteric in-fections， or family history of immune-mediated conditions or IBD. Pertinent negatives were dysuria， melena， or hematoche-zia. She did not smoke or drank alcohol socially， and had only1 male sexual partner.\n\n【29】On physical examination， she was febrile (38.89℃)， tachy-cardic (133 beats/min)， and tachypneic (respiratory rate 22breaths/min)， but normotensive. There was minimal abdominal tenderness and no guarding. The white blood cell count was13 950 cells/uL， lactic acid 2.8 mg/dL， and urinalysis revealed trace leukocyte esterase. The urine culture was negative， but\n\n【30】she received 2 days of intravenous antibiotics for a suspect-ed urinary tract infection (UTI). Computed tomography of her abdomen and pelvis with contrast suggested left pyelonephri-tis； the colon was normal. The stool polymerase chain reac-tion (PCR) was positive for C. difficile， and she was discharged home with oral vancomycin for 14 days. She reported reso-lution of her diarrhea after completion of the 14-day course.\n\n【31】As demonstrated in Figure 2， 2 months later， she presented to a primary care clinic with recurrence of her symptoms， in-cluding profuse watery diarrhea associated with abdominal pain， nausea， fever， and chills. Her stool PCR was again posi-tive for C. difficile. She had not used any other antibiotics be-tween the initial episode and recurrence of CDI. She was given a regimen of tapered and pulsed vancomycin. A month later， via video visit， she revealed that she continued to have pro-fuse diarrhea， every 4 hours， and fidaxomicin was prescribed. It was during this visit that the patient asked if a stray cat she adopted approximately a month before the onset of her ini-tial symptoms might have contributed to her condition. She had plans at this time to isolate herself from her cat and take her cat to the veterinarian for testing while completing her fi-daxomicin course. Given chronic diarrhea， she was referred to gastroenterology for further evaluation. One month later， the cat stool antigen test was positive for C. difficile， and treat-ment was commenced by a veterinarian. The cat displayed no symptoms； however， the patient was also concerned about the cat’s health， given the proximity to her in her apartment and the temporal relationship of the symptom onset and her adop-tion of the pet. One month later， she saw her gastroenterology doctor who had previously found her stool to be positive (by PCR) for the C. difficile toxin gene. She began treatment with bezlotoxumab. The patient described that the symptoms were not resolved until both her and her cat were treated. The pa-tient followed up in clinic 2 months later without any gastro-intestinal complaints and confirmed resolution of symptoms.\n\n【32】epidemiological triangle of infectious disease. Focusing on the interaction between the host， the environment， and the pathogen can help us understand this rare case of community-acquired C. difficite.\n\n【33】Environmental factors play a significant role in the pathogen-esis of recurrent community-acquired CDI. A study in Houston， Texas identified pathogenic C. difficile in household and public environments； recovering toxigenic C difficile endospores in32% of samples collected from various household items and community areas， compared with 16.5% positive isolates from hospitals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>. The most common sources were parks (24.6%samples positive)， followed by homes (17.1%)， commercial stores (8.1%)， and fast-food restaurants (6.5%).\n\n【34】There is a general lack of data on the prevalence of patho-gens in household pets and on the incidence of human infec-tions that can be attributed to pets 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. However， it has been hypothesized before that a patient who experiences CDI could transmit C. difficile to a pet， and the pet could then act as a reservoir for recurrence of C. difficile in the original patient or colonization of those who did not carry the pathogen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. There is yet to be a study that demonstrates the direct trans-mission of C. difficile between household pets and their own-ers， but Loo et al found that 2/9 (22%) of cats and 2/5(40%) of dogs belonging to owners that had experienced CDI carried identical strains of C. difficile 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Studies have shown isolates of pathogenic clones of C. difficile in cat feces； specifically，the RT 014 strain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，4\\]</u>. However， there is no evidence that this bacterium is pathogenic to cats. Furthermore， evidence from stool-sample isolation that humans and their pets had simi-lar strains of C. difficile makes it possible that our patient's re-current CA-CDI was derived from this natural reservoir 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is also worth noting that although the rates of recurrent CDI in cats are not well known， it is hypothetically possible that the cat mentioned in our case could become re-infected and cause a recurrent infection in the patient. Given these find-ings， both household and environmental reservoirs must be considered in the etiology of CA-CDI.\n\n【35】This study was limited by the fact that whole genome sequenc-ing was not performed on stool isolates. As such， resolution of the patient's stool microbiota was limited. Additionally，the patient was exposed to ciprofloxacin prior to her initial CDI which is a risk factor for CDI\n\n【36】Conclusions\n\n【37】In conclusion， given the temporal relationship between the pa-tient's symptom onset and the adoption of the cat， and given the resolution of the patient's symptoms following treatment of the cat， it is possible that the patient acquired C. difficile from the cat. This case highlights the importance of compre-hensive history taking and considers the zoonotic transmis-sion of C. difficile as a novel etiology of CA-CDI.\n\n【38】Acknowledgements\n\n【39】Special thanks to medical illustrator Rachael Whitehead for her assistance with the figure used in this manuscript.\n\n【40】Statement\n\n【41】This case report was presented at the American College of Gastroenterology 2022 Annual Scientific Meeting &Postgraduate Course on October 24， 2022， in Charlotte， North Carolina， and won outstanding poster presenter award.\n\n【42】Declaration of Figures' Authenticity\n\n【43】All figures submitted have been created by the authors who confirm that the images are original with no duplication and have not been previously published in whole or in part.\n\n【44】1\\.

The diagnosis may be difficult to make and complete surgical excision is challenging due to the proximity of the vagus nerve from which it originates.

On examination， a bulg-ing left parapharyngeal mass was noted displacing the left tonsil and uvula medially and associated with left neck full-ness. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck showed a large， hypervascular soft tissue mass with splaying of the left internal carotid artery. Extensive varices were noted to be present throughout the face and neck. The left internal jugular vein was partially occluded at the level of and inferior to the mass， possibly secondary to compression by the mass .\n\n【27】During surgical excision， the tumor was found to be arising from the vagus nerve. On cut section， the tumor had a soft center that was suggestive of either cystic or necrotic change. The ap proximate size of the mass was 4.7x3.6x3.0 cm. The origin ap-peared to be at the level of the left carotid artery bifurcation.\n\n【28】Due to the size of this parapharyngeal space tumor， a decision was made to resect it surgically， after weighing the risks and benefits of the procedure with the patient. Intraoperatively，the tumor was found to be arising from the vagus nerve. During the resection of the tumor， all attempts were made to peel the outer capsule off the tumor to preserve the nerve branch-es. The central portion of the tumor was moderately firm and was removed in one piece.\n\n【29】Macroscopic pathology examination showed an ovoid， firm， tan-red tumor that was not well-encapsulated， measuring4.5×3.5×2.7 cm. Two firm nodules were identified measuring\n\n【30】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

The two other nodules were benign， reactive lymph nodules.\n\n【36】Postoperatively， the patient developed left vocal cord paral-ysis， for which she underwent left medialization thyroplas-ty. However， the hoarseness of her voice persisted follow-ing surgery.\n\n【37】Discussion\n\n【38】Neurogenic tumors of the parapharyngeal space are rare， with55% of these tumors being schwannomas and approximately\n\n【39】half of these arising from the vagus nerve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Most schwan-nomas occur between the third and sixth decade of life， af-fecting both genders equally， and have minimal risk of malig nant transformation. Schwannoma presents as a slow-growing， fixed， and painless mass. When schwannoma arises in the neck， hoarseness of voice is the most common symptom. However， as in this case， a pathognomonic clinical sign is a cough on palpation of the mass 4.\n\n【40】Schwannoma of the vagus nerve should be differentiated from other tumors in the neck before planning surgery to minimize the risk of nerve injury due to proximity of the tumor to the vagus nerve. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)， ultraso-nography， computed tomography (CT)， and magnetic reso-nance imaging (MRI) are all preoperative diagnostic methods， although MRI appears to be the investigation of choice for the diagnosis and identification of the nerve of origin.\n\n【41】In this case， the tumor showed two main histological patterns， consistent with a diagnosis of benign schwannoma. The more cellular areas (Antoni A) include palisading of cell nuclei of the spindle cells and round cells (Verocay bodies)； the less cellular areas (Antoni B) contain edematous stroma in which fibers and cells form no distinctive pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Using immunohistochem-istry， schwannoma typically shows bundles of spindle cells， which are strongly positive for S-100 protein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【42】Surgical excision is the treatment of choice for vagal schwan-noma and the surgical approach taken will depend on the tu-mor size， location， and proximity to the vagus nerve and vessels of the neck. The main postoperative complication is hoarse-ness of the voice due to vocal cord palsy， sometimes associ-ated with coughing and choking while eating 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. This patient developed left vocal cord palsy after surgery， and despite un-dergoing left medialization thyroplasty， her voice was perma-nently affected.\n\n【43】Conclusions\n\n【44】Schwannoma arising from the vagus nerve in the neck is a rare tumor that is usually asymptomatic but requires surgical exci-sion. Physicians need to be aware of the diagnostic work-up and differential diagnosis of a neck mass， the surgical treat-ment， and the postoperative complications， and preoperative planning is also important. The prognosis of schwannomas af-ter complete excision is good， and recurrence is rare.\n\n【45】Competing interests\n\n【46】1\\.

It can be caused by several medical conditions， and it is thought to arise from a combination of im-paired mucosal barrier and chemical and ischemic insults to the esophagus. Acute esophageal necrosis usu-ally presents with severe complications due to delayed diagnosis and only rarely has surgical indications. We present a case of Gurvits syndrome， presumably triggered by metabolic acidosis in a diabetic patient.\n\n【26】Case Report：\n\n【27】A 61-year-old man with history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with metformin， cana-gliflozin， glimepiride， and pioglitazone came to our attention with persistent vomiting， odynophagia， chest pain after each meal， and progressive weight loss. Arterial blood analysis showed mild metabolic acidosis， while the first esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed revealed a circumferential black appearance of the esophageal mucosa， as in concentric necrosis of the distal esophagus with possible fungal superinfection. Brushing cytolo-gy confirmed the infection by Candida spp. and the patient was treated with intravenous fluconazole. The sec-ond esophagogastroduodenoscopy， performed after 2 weeks， showed almost complete healing of the esopha-geal mucosa； in this case， biopsy confirmed mucosal ischemia and necrosis， without showing deep impairment of the mucosa by fungal agents.\n\n【28】Conclusions：\n\n【29】Due to its high lethality， often caused by the underlying medical diseases， acute esophageal disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of digestive symptoms， even without upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of contextual collateral conditions can help clinicians to avoid the worst out-comes of the disease. Among the causative factors of metabolic acidosis leading to esophageal necrosis we recognized metformin and dapagliflozin.\n\n【30】Keywords： Acute Disease ·Esophageal Perforation·Esophagus\n\n【31】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/939624\n\n【32】国11894 1 山可：3 全国17\n\n【33】Publishers note： All daims expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of their affiliated\n\n【34】AP\n\n【35】organizations， or those of the publisher the editors and the reviewers.

It was described for the first time in 1990 by Goldenberg et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>， but brought into the spotlight only in 2007 by Gurvits et al， who gave the name to the un-derlying syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【37】The prevalence of AEN is up to 0.2% in autopsy series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， while it can be even lower in endoscopy series (0.01-0.28% of cas-es). Its incidence seems to be higher in males (up to 4 times higher than in females) and in middle-aged subjects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>. In most cases AEN affects the distal esophagus， with a preva-lence of 97%， usually sparing the other two-thirds of the or-gan and only rarely extended proximally， stopping almost uni-versally at the gastro-esophageal junction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【38】Since its etiopathogenesis is supposed to be multifactorial， a holistic approach to patients is needed to provide a definite diagnosis： AEN， in fact， is thought to arise from a combina-tion of impaired mucosal barrier and chemical and ischemic insults to the esophagus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Possible risk factors for the de-velopment of this syndrome are male sex， malignancies， dia-betes mellitus， cardiovascular diseases， prothrombotic condi-tions， chronic kidney disease， malnutrition， alcohol abuse， and gastro-esophageal reflux disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Eventual complications include stenosis or stricture formation in the distal esophagus， perforation， and mediastinitis； microbial superinfections (bacte-rial and/or fungal) of ischemic/necrotic areas are not rare and often need broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic or antifun-gal treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>； general treatment include high-dose proton pump inhibitors (PPls)， fluid therapy， correction of causative conditions， and monitoring for eventual complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【39】Surgery is usually reserved to treat esophageal perforation with subsequent mediastinitis and abscess formation： stan-dard surgical approaches can be followed by esophagectomy， decortication， lavage， and delayed reconstruction， while prima-ry closure of the perforated tissue is not recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【40】The clinical presentation of AEN depends on the status of the esophageal mucosa and on the underlying medical conditions leading to mucosal ischemia and necrosis： symptoms range from functional pyrosis， vomiting， progressive dysphagia，and hematemesis. Overall mortality is usually related to the same conditions described above， ranging from 13% to 35%.Prompt diagnosis and therapy are thus necessary to avoid the worst outcomes related to the syndrome.\n\n【41】Until 2007， as reported by Gurvits et al， a total of 88 patients were diagnosed with AEN， while， to date (March 1， 2023)，“black esophagus\" is cited in less than 800 articles (less than 700if we consider the “Acute esophageal necrosis\") in PubMed.\n\n【42】In this article we described the case of a diabetic patient ad-mitted to our hospital with persistent digestive symptoms and later diagnosed with AEN， which was presumably caused by acidosis secondary to antidiabetic treatment， with superficial Candida spp. infection.\n\n【43】Case Report\n\n【44】A 61-year-old man of Bulgarian origin with a medical histo-ry of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was admitted to our hospital with a 4-week history of persistent odynophagia， continuous vomiting， epigastric pain after each meal， and progressive weight loss of about 5 kilograms due to forced liquid diet. At hospital observation he was 175 cm tall， weighed 85 kilograms， with a body mass index (BMI) of 27.8and showed cutaneous and mucosal moderate dehydration. His home medications included metformin， canagliflozin， glimepiri-de， and pioglitazone， but he was taking no medications for hy-pertension. He was a former smoker (20 pack years) and de-nied drinking alcohol， caustic ingestion， or eating spicy foods.\n\n【45】His vital signs were the following： Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)15 (E4V5M6)， body temperature 36.5℃， blood pressure 165/100mmHg， heart rate 120 beats per minute (bpm) and percuta-neous oxygen saturation 98% on ambient air， without signs of dyspnoea (respiratory rate 14 per minute).\n\n【46】The physical examination was completely negative for remark-able pathological signs， while laboratory analysis revealed neu-trophilic leukocytosis， and hyperglycemia (300 mg/dl)， with mild elevation of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c， 56.0 mmol/mol according to IFCC standardization) and mild hypertriglyc-eridemia .\n\n【47】Arterial blood gas analysis showed metabolic acidosis and only partial respiratory compensation (pH 7.33， pO2 95 mmHg，pCO217 mmHg， HCO3-9 meq/L， LAC 1.4 mmol/L). The patient was diagnosed with “compensated metabolic acidosis in a diabet-ic patient.\" The Emergency Room (ER) chest X-ray did not re-veal signs of pneumonia or pleural effusion.\n\n【48】The patient was then admitted to the hospital and was treated with oral proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)， later switched to intra-venous administration， and basal bolus insulin with improved blood glycemic levels， and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Empiric antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanate was also instituted， as well as subcutaneous low-molecular-weight\n\n【49】heparin (LMWH， enoxaparin) at prophylactic dosage (4000IU/die)； oral antidiabetic drugs were obviously discontinued.\n\n【50】On day 2， the patient underwent esophagogastroduodenos-copy (EGD)， which revealed a malacic esophagus with circum-ferential necrosis of the distal third of the mucosa stopping at the gastro-esophageal junction； moreover， EGD showed a bulbar Forrest III ulcer with no sign of recent local bleeding. Biopsies were not taken due to mucosal fra-gility， but cellular brushing was performed. The patient was kept on nil per os (NPO) and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) while thoraco-abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan-ning was requested.\n\n【51】We also investigated the main causes of esophagitis， exclud-ing some of the most important viral causes (HBV， HCV， her-pes simplex and zoster， CMV， and EBV)， searching for signs of an immunocompromised state： the study of lymphocyte sub-population and the HIV 1/2 test were both negative， as well as\n\n【52】the blood cultures performed before empiric antibiotic thera-py. CT scans revealed thickening of the distal esophagus， but no esophageal perforation .\n\n【53】On day 5 we received the brush cytology report， which revealed fungal hyphae by Candida spp. and， consequently， parenteral antifungal treatment with fluconazole was started. Due to the improvement of digestive symptoms， the patient started oral feeding in addition to partial parenteral nutrition (PPN). The general conditions continued to improve with this treatment and EGD was repeated 2 weeks after admission， showing al-most complete healing of the necrotic mucosal area that was biopsied . After completion of intravenous anti-fungal therapy for 24 days， the patient was finally discharged home in good condition. Previous home antidiabetic therapy was not re-initiated and only insulin therapy was recommend-ed while waiting for careful specialist evaluation.\n\n|  |  | Blood tests  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Parameter  | Normal value Lrange)  | Patient's value  | Parameter  | Normal value (range)  | Patient's value  |\n| WBC  | 4.00-11.00  | 26.29×10/uL\\  | Urea  | 17-43  | 66 mg/dL\\  |\n| RBC  | 4.50-6.50  | 5.39×106/uL  | Creatinin  | 0.50-1.20  | 0.90 mg/dL  |\n| Hb  | 13.0-18.0  | 17.0g/dl  | eGFR  | \\>90  | 86ml/min\\  |\n| HCT  | 40-54  | 47%  | Total bilirubin  | <1.20  | 4.41 mg/dL\\  |\n| MCV  | 76-96  | 87 fl  | Direct bilirubin  | 0.00-0.30  | 0.65 mg/dL\\  |\n| MCH  | 27.0-32.0  | 31.5 pg  | Sodium  | 136-145  | 130mmol/L\\  |\n| MCHC  | 30.0-35.0  | 36.4 g/dl\\  | Potassium  | 3.5-5.3  | 3.5mmol/L  |\n| PLT  | 150-450  | 367×10/uL  | ALT  | <50  | 17 U/L  |\n| Neutrophils  | 2.00-7.50  | 22.97×10/pL\\  | LDH  | <248  | 102 U/L  |\n| Lymphocytes  | 1.50-5.00  | 1.50×10/uL  | CPK  | <170  | 17 U/L  |\n| Monocytes  | 0.20-1.00  | 1.77×10/uL\\  | Lipase  | <67  | 8 U/L  |\n| Eosinophils  | 0.04-0.40  | 0.00×10/uL  | TSH  | 0.25-4.50  | 0.65 uU/mL  |\n| Basophils  | 0.01-0.10  | 0.05×10/uL  | CRP  | <0.50  | 3.84 mg/dL\\  |\n| PT (INR)  |  | 1.12  | HS Troponin I  | <20  | 9 ng/L  |\n| PT (Ratio)  | 0.80-1.20  | 1.12  | Procalcitonin  | <0.5  | 0.14 ng/mL  |\n| PTT (Ratio)  | 0.82-1.20  | 0.93  | Proteins  | 6.6-8.4  | 7.6g/dL  |\n| Fibrinogen  | 150-400  | 478 mg/dL\\  | Total cholesterol  | <200  | 228 mg/dL  |\n| Glucose  | 70-110  | 300 mg/dL\\  | HDL cholesterol  | \\>35  | 37 mg/dL  |\n|  |  |  | Triglycerides  | <150  | 345 mg/dL\\  |\n\n| Viral antibody tests  |  |  | Fungal antigen tests  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Parameter  | Normal value  | Patient's value  | Parameter  | Normal value  | Patient's value  |\n| HbsAg  | <0.05  | <0.030U/mL  | Galactomannan  | <0.16  | 0.02 index  |\n| HbsAg  | <0.05  | <0.030U/mL  | Antigen  | <0.16  | 0.02 index  |\n| HBsAb  | <10  | <3.00 UI/L  | Beta-D-Glucan  | ≤7  | <3 pg/mL  |\n| HbA1c  | 23.0-43.0  | 56.0 mmol/mol\\  |  |  |  |\n| Anti-CMVIgG  |  | 56 U/mL  | Flow cytometry  |  |  |\n| Anti-CMVIgM  | 一  | Negative  | Parameter  | Normal value (range)  | Patient's value  |\n| Anti-herpes simplex 1/2IgG  | <0.9  | \\>30.0  | TotalCD3+  | 58-72  | 71%  |\n| Anti-herpes simplex 1/2 IgM  | <0.9  | <0.500  | CD3+ CD4+  | 34-48  | 42%  |\n| Anti-herpes simplex 2IgG  | <0.9  | <0.500  | CD3+ CD8+  | 15-27  | 30%\\  |\n| Anti-Varicella-Zoster gG  | ≤134  | 1，776  | CD4/CD8 Ratio  | 1.00-2.80  | 1.40  |\n| Anti-Varicella Zoster gM  | <0.9  | 0.13  | Total CD3  | 603-2，990  | 1590/uL  |\n| Anti-EBV VCA IgG  | <20  | 113  | CD4  | 441-2，156  | 933/uL  |\n| Anti-EBV VCA IgM  | <20  | <10.0 U/mL  | CD8  | 125-1，312  | 666/uL  |\n| HIV 1-2  | 一  | Negative  |  |  |  |\n\n【56】WBC- white blood cells； RBC -red blood cells； Hb- haemoglobin； HCT -haematocrit； MCV- medium corpuscular volume； MCH- mean corpuscular haemoglobin； MCHC-mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration； PLT - platelets； PT(INR)- prothrombin time (international normalized ratio)； aPTT - activated partial thromboplastin time； eGFR - estimated glomerular filtration rate； ALT - alanine transferase； LDH -lactate dehydrogenase； CPK- creatine phosphokinase； TSH-thyroid-stimulating hormone； CRP - C reactive protein； HBsAg-hepatitis B s antigen； HbsAb-anti-bepatitis B surface； CMV -cytomegalovirus； EBV-Epstein Barr virus； HIV - human immunodeficiency virus.

The multifactorial etiopathogene-sis is supposed to be the basis for the development of“black esophagus\" and diabetic-related acidosis can be among the most common underlying conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，12\\]</u>.\n\n【60】Diabetes mellitus， together with malignancies， chronic kid-ney disease， poor nutritional status， cardiovascular illnesses， and general deconditioning， can predispose to altered and\n\n【61】compromised mucosal barriers， which could potentiate even-tual chemical or ischemic injury to the esophagus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，14\\]</u>.\n\n【62】A low-flow state， common in case of sepsis， congestive heart failure， systemic inflammation， or lactic- and keto-acidosis， can lead to mucosal ischemia and necrosis (focal or extend-ed)， which is favoured by the particular segmentation of the arterial network of the esophagus. While the upper third is vascularized by the descending branches from the inferior thyroid arteries and numerous additional small arteries， the middle esophagus receives its blood supply from the bronchi-al arteries， right third or fourth intercostal arteries， and nu-merous small esophageal arteries from the descending aorta. Finally， the distal third of the esophagus has less blood sup-ply， provided by small branches from the left gastric artery or left inferior phrenic artery， with several possible anatom-ic variations： consequently， ischemic injuries typically affect this part of the organ.\n\n【63】O Am J Case Rep 2023； 24：e939624\n\n【64】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

Some of the patient’s own medications (eg， metformin and cana gliflozin) may also have contributed to development of meta-bolic acidosis， as already described for biguanides and SGLT-2 inhibitors in a small percentage of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，16\\]</u>.\n\n【70】As already stated above， microbial infections commonly com-plicate AEN， requiring in most cases specific and long-lasting treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> - this happened to our patient， since Candida spp. was identified in brushing samples during the first EGD performed.\n\n【71】Although biopsy is not always needed to confirm the diagno-sis of AEN， it is strongly recommended： necrotic debris， ab-sence of squamous epithelium， and necrosis of mucosa are often present. We were able to collect biopsy samples only during the second EGD due to mucosal fragility at the first en-doscopy： histological analysis showed the presence of ulcer-ated and partially necrotic mucosa， with tracks of granulation tissue， as signs of repair attempts by the esophageal mucosa itself. Hence， all symptoms and findings seem to be compati-ble with the diagnosis of AEN we made and， after 6 months of remote follow-up， the patient did not show further digestive symptoms and reported complete healing of the acute disease.\n\n【72】It is our opinion that the patient's home therapy could be the key for understanding the origin of metabolic acidosis and that one drug or both metformin and canagliflozin could have strongly contributed to it， leading to focal esophageal ischemia and necrosis and， contextually， to the digestive symptoms.\n\n【73】In healthy patients without immune compromise， it is very hard to find circumferential necrosis due to fungal infections， since in immunocompromised subjects such infections usu-ally affect the entire mucosa. In our case， the only finding in mucosal tissue was partial necrosis and no signs of fungal in-filtration were encountered， showing how the fungal infec-tion was primarily the consequence and not the cause of AEN.\n\n【74】As in almost all cases of AEN， factors clearly leading to the disease are rarely found， and also in our case， it was hard to determine which factors formerly acted as the “primum mov-ens\" in the development of esophageal necrosis.\n\n【75】Although AEN is gaining attention among the medical commu-nity， it is still an underdiagnosed illness， and it is rarely recog-nized， with high mortality rates due to delayed diagnosis and therapy. For this reason， we are convinced that each case re-port is a chance for clinicians to learn about such a disease and could be the basis for further and larger studies on the topic.\n\n【76】We presented a case of AEN presumably triggered by meta-bolic acidosis and complicated with fungal infection in a di-abetic patient.\n\n【77】AEN is an uncommon， potentially lethal， medical condition， and should be included in the differential diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal bleeding or digestive symptoms in diabetic patients. The endoscopic approach， with or without biopsy， can be necessary to avoid the worst outcomes of the illness. In this case， we hypothesized that the causative agents lead-ing to esophageal necrosis were (one or both) the antidiabet-ic drugs metformin and canagliflozin.\n\n【78】References：\n\n【79】1\\.

This includes characteristics of populations， influence of health promotion and disease prevention. Considering that we have not yet reached a level of excellence with regard to the quality of life of the elderly， we have to point out the factors to overcome the negative aspect of the disease or illness. In this sense， the objective of the research was to evaluate the quality of life of the elderly， based on a combination of factors that overcome the negative aspect of the disease， emphasizing the relationship of psychological behavioral processes in a space that facilitates the practice of physical activity. Methodology： A descriptive， observational and quantitative study was carried out. The sample consisted of 90 elderly people， 74 (82.2%) female and 16 (17.8%) male. The inclusion criteria were： being 60 years old or older， having preserved cognitive ability and proven physical activity practices in the area of social support and health promotion and disease prevention from the Social Service of Industry， in the municipality of Sao Bernardo do Campo， Sao Paulo， Brazil， between January and December 2011， in the municipality of Sao Bernardo do Campo， Sao Paulo， Brazil. For data collection， the WHOQOL -Bref， the Socioeconomic Assessment Scale-ABIPEME and a questionnaire covering the aspects： physical (domain1)，psychological (domain2)， social relations(domain3)， environment (domain4)， socioeconomic level and sociodemographic data. The results achieved indicated that the quality of life of the elderly is related to several factors such as economic condition， education， social and leisure opportunities in spaces that facilitate the practice of physical activity.\n\n【4】KEYWORDS Quality of Life； Health Promotion； Prevention of diseases\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Population aging is a trend in Brazil， since the number of people aged 60 or over represents about 11% of the total population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

However， epi-demiological studies have shown that diseases and limitations can be prevented in the aging process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【19】From these considerations， it is possible to reflect on health behaviors， based on an ecological approach that values the per-son's relationship with the world， or with their surroundings：cultural， social and physical， existing or perceived by the elderly\n\n【20】通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In this perspective， the present study evaluates the quality of life of the elderly and a combination of factors that overcome the negative aspect of the disease or illness so that aging in Brazil occurs as a positive experience.\n\n【21】Methodology\n\n【22】This study was developed through a descriptive， observational analysis， of the quantitative type composed by elderly people monitored in the area of social support and health promotion and disease prevention of the Social Service of Industry， in the municipality of Sao Bernardo do Campo， Sao Paulo， Brazil， be-tween January and December 2011， in the municipality of Sao Bernardo do Campo， Sao Paulo， Brazil. For this， 90 elderly peo-ple were evaluated，74(82.2%) of whom were female and 16(17.8%) using the following instruments I， II and ⅡII：\n\n【23】I-WHOQOL-Quality of Life Bref of the World Health Or-ganization (WHO)， to measure Quality of Life. It consists of 26questions to assess the global Quality of life (QVB)， divided\n\n【24】into four domains， namely： physical (gift 1)， psychological(gift 2)， social relations (gift 3) and environment (gift 4) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. ⅡI-Socio-economic Evaluation Scale of the Brazilian Association of Market Research Institutes- ABIPEME. II-Questionnaire for the Characterization of the Sample， which included gender， education， frequency of use of the area of social support and health promotion and disease prevention of the Social Service of Industry -Brazil.\n\n【25】Statistical analyzes\n\n【26】For data interpretation， statistical analyzes were performed us-ing the SPSS -Statistical Package for the Social Science， version15.0 for Windows. Descriptive statistical measures of quanti-tative variables and tables were used to describe the sample studied. Sociodemographic variables， global quality of life and the four domains that make up quality of life were analyzed using the anova test and the Tukey test. ANOVA is a table of analysis of variance for comparisons between groups and the Tukey test is the verification of the internal consistency of each group of variables.\n\n【27】Results\n\n【28】Ninety elderly people were interviewed， most of them were female (82.2%) and only 17.8% were male. Of the total sample，35.5%(n=32) had complete primary education and the small-est part of the elderly had university education 4.4% (n=4)， followed by primary education 5.5%(n=5).\n\n【29】The remaining answers can be distributed as follows： 30.0%did not study complete high school and 24.4% studied until complete high school.\n\n【30】There is no reference to economic class， most of the elderly38.9% belong to class E and class D 32.2%. The smallest part of the elderly 3.3% belongs to class B， followed by class C 25.6%.\n\n【31】Regarding physical activity， the data show that 27.8% practice fitness and the least 8.9% use water aerobics. As for the others，21.1% practiced walking and 18.9% did recreational activities，13.3% did gymnastics and 10% did stretching. In addition， it was observed that 67.8% prefer to attend the Social Service of Industry - Brazil， in the morning and 32.20% prefer to attend the place in the afternoon. It is worth mentioning that there was no response during the night.\n\n【32】As for the reason that leads the elderly to attend Social Ser-vice of Industry-Brazil， the data revealed that the majority of\n\n【33】the elderly 51.2% go to the place to promote health and prevent diseases. The second biggest reason 23.3% is the proximity / ac-cessibility of the place. The smallest part of the elderly frequents the place due to the physical environment and other reasons7.7% followed by the condition of use 17.8%. These indexes may suggest a local brand as a source of health promotion for the elderly. The scores of the sociodemographic characteristics of the elderly in each criterion are defined in table 1.\n\n【34】Through the analysis of the collected data， it was possible to verify the factors that lead the elderly to perform physical exercises among the socioeconomic classification .\n\n【35】The data， presented in table 2， suggest that people who be-long to classes D and E attend Social Service of Industry -Brazil， for the pleasure of being in the place. Class C people， on the other hand， attend Social Service of Industry -Brazil， to prevent diseases. It is worth mentioning that none of the people in class B attend Social Service of Industry-Brazil， for the pleasure of be-ing in the place， they attend or because of an already established disease， for disease prevention or for other reasons.\n\n【36】The data may suggest that the lower the economic class， the reason： pleasure in being there is greater. It is observed that there were statistically significant differences between the means of the physical， psychological and environmental domains for the el-derly (n=90)， table 3. Initially， Pearson's correlation between the domains (physical，psychological， social relations， environment) and the global quality of life domain was made. All domains correlated positively and significantly with the global domain， although the correlations are of low magnitude. Description in table 4.\n\n【37】As shown in table 4， Tukey's statistical test indicated that there is a significant difference between domain2 (psychologi-cal) and domain3 (social relations) when compared to domain1(physical) and domain4 (environment) domains.\n\n【38】This means that the elderly is better in the psychological and social relations domain and are worse in relation to the environ-ment and physical domain. The statistical test indicated that there is a significant difference (p <0.05) between the domains and the overall quality of life of the elderly who attend Social Service of Industry- Brazil. The data revealed that the elderly’s(psychological) domain2 is better than the perception of their overall quality of life. However， when comparing the global quality of life of the elderly with the domain4 (environment)， the data show that the global quality of life is better for the elderly.\n\n【39】This seems to suggest that domain4 (environment) is the worst domain for the elderly who participated in this study. Regarding the relationship between quality of life and economic class， the Tuckey statistical test performed did not show any statistically significant difference (p<0，05) between the variables：economic condition， domains and the overall quality of life of the elderly who attend the Social Service of Industry-Brazil.\n\n【40】These data suggest that having a good quality of life is not necessarily related to the individual's socioeconomic status. In addition， according to table 5， the data also showed that there was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05) between the domains and the overall quality of life when compared to the activities that the elderly perform at Social Service of Industry-Brazil. These results seem to suggest that the perception of the quality of life of the elderly at Social Service of Industry -Brazil， is not directly linked to the type of activity that they perform in the place.\n\n【41】From the results presented， in table 6， it is possible to say that there was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05) between：\n\n【42】the domains and the overall quality of life when related to the reason why people attend Social Service of Industry -Brazil.\n\n【43】This suggests that the perception of the subject's quality of life is not directly linked to the reason why the subject attends Social Service of Industry - Brazil.\n\n【44】As shown in Table 7， a comparison was made between the domains， overall quality of life with the time of physical activ-ity practiced by the elderly. The data revealed that there was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05). This means that the time of physical activity that the elderly perform does not directly determine how they perceive their quality of life.\n\n【45】Discussion\n\n【46】The recommendation made by Patrick； Deyo 通用删除7(英):<u>(1989)</u>， that the definition of the concept of quality of life and the possibility of evaluation is not only qualitative， it can also be quantitative， using instruments for evaluating quality of life， capable of eval-uating indices in a wide variety of populations.\n\n【47】Considering the sociodemographic characteristics of the sam-ple studied， it can be said that the main reason that lead the elderly to attend Social Service of Industry -Brazil is the pre-vention of diseases and health promotion. The analysis of the data found suggests that the Social Service of Industry-Brazil is being valued by the elderly who attend it， as spaces that pre-vent diseases， promote well-being， health and social support. Therefore， among other options， when the elderly attend Social Service of Industry - Brazil， they can practice physical activities that delay the onset of diseases (primary prevention)， for those already sick， avoid complications of chronic diseases (secondary prevention). In addition， the location is favorable for rehabilita-tion， in cases where it was not possible to prevent the disease from worsening and the appearance of sequelae 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【48】The analysis of the global quality of life and domains shows that the elderly in domain2 (psychological) of the elderly is bet-ter than domain4 (environment). The fact that the elderly are better in the domain2 (psychological)， means that： the elderly are better in terms of positive feelings； thought；learning； memory； concentration； self esteem； body image； appearance； negative feelings； spirituality； religion and personal beliefs. However， the elderly are worse in terms of domain4 (environment)， which means they are worse in terms of： physical security； protection； home environment； financial resources； health and social care(availability and quality)； opportunity to acquire new informa-tion and skills； participation in recreation /leisure opportunities； physical environment (pollution / noise / traffic / climate)and transport.\n\n【49】These data refer to the placement of (PEREIRA et al.，2007)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> that an adequate physical environment has a positive in-fluence on the quality of life of the elderly. This may suggest that for the elderly population studied， the lack of an adequate environment is influencing the perception of the quality of their lives. To analyze these data， it is worth remembering the consid-eration of (Pereira et al. 2007) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> that when making any kind of subjective assessment\n\n【50】of quality of life in the elderly， it is necessary to consider the feeling and the meaning of the changes， gains and psychological losses that occur in the different stages of aging， ranging from physical changes to devaluation Social.\n\n【51】For (PEREIRA et al.，2007) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> the simple possibility of the elderly being active makes them more satisfied with life and， con-sequently， better quality of life， than those elderly people who often do not go out alone and therefore end up easily subjected\n\n【52】to isolation and depression. This means that the elderly partic-ipating in this research， because they attend the Social Service of Industry-Brazil， may have a better quality of life than those elderly people who do not perform physical activities or are in nursing homes. In addition， quality of life is the result of several measures based on\"biopsychosocial\" indicators. Therefore， it encompasses many aspects， such as population characteristics； influence of health promotion and disease prevention at primary， secondary and tertiary levels. From the analysis of these results， it can be said that the fact that the elderly can attend the Social Service of Industry-Brazil， whether for physical or recreational activities， is representing the possibility of social network and affective support， which according to (Eizirik et al. 2001) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>， it is very important for people who are in old age. This means that attending Social Service of Industry -Brazil， can enable the elderly to have contact with people， which generates emotional support and reinforces the capacity for self-assessment， that is， it is providing new social contacts， of important significance， since it allows the elderly maintain a social identity. These results may suggest the theoretical consideration of (Flanagan 1982) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>， that not only the concept of physical health is linked to quality of life. This means that for the elderly population studied， when assessing their quality of life， they take into account aspects such as： working conditions， economic resources，education， access to health services， family relationships， housing conditions， food， leisure， that is， they evaluate aspects of physical health， mental health， social functions， role performances and general percep-tion of health (FLANAGAN， 1982) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In this sense， in this study， it seems that factors such as： role performance， mental health， social adaptation， and the general perception of health influenced the assessment of the quality of life of the elderly (SA JUNIOR， 2004) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. With regard to the overall quality of life， the data did not reveal a statistically significant difference in relation to the economic class， that is， having a good financial situation does not guarantee mental health and does not influence the perception of quality of life. This means\n\n【53】that the socio-economic condition does not seem to directly influence the perception of well-being and the general satisfac-tion with the lives of the elderly who responded to the survey. Analyzing the results achieved， the proposal by (Pereira et al.2007) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> that the quality of life reflects much more the percep-tion of individuals about whether their needs are being met or if the opportunity for self-realization is being denied， than the state of physical health or social and economic conditions.\n\n【54】These results also correspond to that described by Diener，(MUCHINSKY，2004) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> that although society is experiencing the era of materialism， studies have shown that there is little significant relationship between the acquisition of goods and the individual's general satisfaction with life.Thus， it seems that the results found in this study suggest that material rewards are not enough for a person to be happy， while factors such as： having family life， having friends， time for reflection， are much more related to the feeling of happiness and consequently the quality of life (MUCHINSKY，2004) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【55】This study also carried out an analysis of the correlation be-tween the domains and the overall quality of life of the elderly. The data identified that all domains correlate positively and sig-nificantly with the overall quality of life. This result was also found by (Pereira et al. 2007) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>， in the study on the contri-bution of the physical， social， psychological and environmental domains to the quality of life of the elderly.\n\n【56】As in the studies by (Pereira et al. 2007) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.， in this study，\n\n【57】Table 1 Caracteristicas Sociodemograficas dos idosos.\n\n| Variables  | Levels  | Quantity  | %  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Genre  | Male  | 16  | 17，8  |\n| Genre  | Female  | /4  | 82，2  |\n| Education  | Did not study primary  | 27  | 30，0  |\n| Education  | Complete primary  | 32  | 35，5  |\n| Education  | Complete primary education  | 5  | 5，5  |\n| Education  | High School  | 22  | 24，4  |\n| Education  | Full university  | 4  | 44  |\n| ABIPEME Socioeconomic Classification  | B  | 3  | 33  |\n| ABIPEME Socioeconomic Classification  |  | 23  | 25，6  |\n| ABIPEME Socioeconomic Classification  | D  | 29  | 32，2  |\n| ABIPEME Socioeconomic Classification  | E  | 35  | 38，9  |\n| Preference Period  | Morning  | 61  | 67，8  |\n| Preference Period  | Afternoon  | 29  | 32，2  |\n| Activities that elderly people practice  | Walking  | 19  | 21，1  |\n| Activities that elderly people practice  | Water aerobics  | 8  | 8，9  |\n| Activities that elderly people practice  | Stretching  | 9  | 10，0  |\n| Activities that elderly people practice  | Recreational activities  | 1/  | 18，9  |\n| Activities that elderly people practice  | Set of physical exercises  | 12  | 13，3  |\n| Activities that elderly people practice  | Fitness  | 25  | 27，8  |\n| Reason  | Promote health and prevent diseases  | 46  | 51，2  |\n| Reason  | Proximity \\accessibility  | 21  | 23，3  |\n| Reason  | Subjective condition (well-being)  | 16  | 17，8  |\n| Reason  | Physical environment / Other reasons  | 7  | 7，7  |\n| Attend other places  | (Yes) other parks  | 8  | 8，9  |\n| Attend other places  | (Yes) specialized centers  | 13  | 14，4  |\n| Attend other places  | Does not practice elsewhere  | 69  | 76，7  |\n\n【59】Table 2 Factors that lead the elderly to perform physical exercises between socioeconomic classification.\n\n| Reason for frequenting exercise space  | ABIPEME  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Reason for frequenting exercise space  | B  | C  | D  | E  | Total  |\n| Disease already established  | 1  | 1  | 5  | 4  | 11  |\n| Prevention of diseases  | 1  | 11  | 8  | 8  | 28  |\n| Pleasure to be on site  | 0  | 8  | 14  | 21  | 43  |\n| Other reasons  | 1  | 3  | 2  | 2  | 8  |\n\n【61】Table 3 Description of the comparison between the global quality of life and the domains of quality of life of the elderly.\n\n| Description of the comparison  | Average  | Standard deviation  | P  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Physical Domain  | 14，9  | 2，6  | 0，776  |\n| Global Quality of Life  | 15.0  | 3，1  | 0，776  |\n| Psychological Domain  | 15，8  | 1，6  | 0，008  |\n| Global Quality of Life  | 15，0  | 3，1  | 0，008  |\n| Social Relations Domain  | 15，5  | 2，8  | 0，189  |\n| Global Quality of Life  | 15，0  | 3，1  | 0，189  |\n| Domain Environment  | 13，9  | 1，9  | 0，000  |\n| Global Quality of Life  | 15.0  | 3，1  | 0，000  |\n\n【63】Table 4 Estimation of Pearson's correlation coefficients between the domains and the overall quality of life of the elderly.\n\n| Correlations  | Domain Physicist  | Psychological Domain  | Social Relations Domain  | Domain Environment  | Global Quality of Life  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Pearson Correlation  | 1，000  | .501\\\\  | 452\\\\  | .523\\\\  | 451\\\\  |\n| Sig.

explaining the quality of the global path to a limited extent. However， the occurrence of changes in one or more domains may imply changes in the overall quality of life. This means that： in the face of changes， in one or more domains， the person may be influenced by his general satisfaction with his life and his general perception of well-being. In addition， it is worth remembering also the authors (Morag， 1995 and Kimura，1999) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15-16\\]</u>， who report that the quality of life is formed by several factors， objective and subjective， which vary from person to person and are influenced by cultural， religious values， ethnic， aspects related to functional capacity， affective and emotional behavior， social interactions， work and economic situation. And although a consensus has not yet been reached on the definition of quality of life， it is believed that there are three fundamental aspects， subjectivity； multidimensionality and presence of posi-tive and negative dimensions (MORENO， 2007) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Therefore， the overall quality of life and the domains of quality of life seem to be two different ways of assessing people’s quality of life. In addition， this study， by evaluating the quality of life in hu-man beings， sought to respect the judgment that each individual makes when he is able to assess the quality of his life (PEREIRA et al. 2007)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【74】The analysis of the data seems to suggest Social Service of In-dustry-Brazil， whose mission is to promote the quality of life of workers and their dependents， in this study it can be considered as a favorable place for health promotion and disease prevention. Therefore， it is important to consider the meaning of falling ill and health， considering the subjectivity of the individual and the objectivity of programs that aim to improve people’s quality of life， in addition to understanding the importance of health pro-motion and disease prevention strategies (CZERESNIA， 2003)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. From this perspective of analysis，the elderly who use the services provided by Social Service of Industry-Brazil end up， according to the proposal of (Buss， 2003) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>， having the oppor-tunity to take care of their health， increasing their life expectancy(making it more healthy)， and it ends up improving the percep-tion of quality of life. However， it is important to emphasize that for the collection and analysis of data， the recommendation of (Fortes，2002) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u> was taken into account， that to carry out health research studies， like this one， one must have an ethical concern with human beings. Human beings， safeguarding their autonomous participation， privacy， confidentiality and secrecy.\n\n【75】Conclusion\n\n【76】With the preparation of this study， it was possible to study qual-ity of life in its multiple aspects， encompassing a combination of factors that supplant the negative aspect of the disease： work-ing conditions； economic resources； schooling； access to health services； subjective characteristics that include positive and neg ative elements of the population； influence of health promotion and disease prevention at primary， secondary and tertiary levels. In addition， the research made it possible to think about the concept of health in an ecological perspective， based on the rela-tionships that man establishes with the environment， in addition to social， physical and biological forces.\n\n【77】From the analysis of the statistical data found， it can be said that the Social Service of Industry - Brazil has been a favor-able environment for disease prevention and health promotion， which appears as a reaction to the medicalization of health and is linked to the process health-disease. These actions combined with other strategies contribute to the\n\n【78】increase in health promotion for the population. In addition，\n\n【79】another factor may be associated with the importance of the actions carried out by the Social Service of Industry- Brazil： the reduction of the sedentary lifestyle index and its consequences for the population. In other words， since Social Service of Indus-try-Brazil is a suitable place for practicing physical activities， it is estimated that the elderly have more opportunities to pre-vent the onset of chronic diseases， which may arise as a result of the lifestyle. Life， sedentary life. It is known that this study being quantitative， ends up facing some limitations. Perhaps the biggest one is found in the fact that the assessment of quality of life depended on the emotional interpretation that the studied sample made of facts and events that are closely linked to the subjective perception of events and the conditions of their lives. In theory， it is expected that the individual will be able to com-bine different aspects of his life and also be able to summarize them in a global assessment of his quality of life. However， we must take into account the subjectivity of the subjects， therefore， it is valid that， we must not leave aside， the doubt that they really summarize everything or whether they include or exclude only aspects that concern them recently.\n\n【80】Acknowledgements\n\n【81】Sao Bernardo do Campo City Hall and Industry Social Service.\n\n【82】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of interests</u>\n\n【83】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There is no conflict of interest to declare.</u>\n\n【84】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Funding</u>\n\n【85】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Research funded by CNPq -PIBIC</u>\n\n【86】通用结尾删除-1:<u>References</u>\n\n【87】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

This involves timely identification and treatment of medical comorbidities and ab-normal laboratory values that could complicate the patient's perioperative course. There are several potential causes of anion and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis in surgical patients， most of which could profoundly af-fect a patient's surgical outcome. Thus， the presence of an acute acid-base disturbance requires a thorough workup， the results of which will influence the patient's anesthetic management.\n\n【19】Case Report：\n\n【20】An otherwise-healthy 24-year-old female presented for elective spine surgery and was found to have metabol-ic acidosis， hypotension， and polyuria intraoperatively. Common causes of acute metabolic acidosis were in-vestigated and systematically ruled out， including lactic acidosis， diabetic ketoacidosis， drug-induced ketoac-idosis， ingestion of toxic alcohols (e.g.， methanol， ethylene glycol)， uremia， and acute renal failure. Laboratory workup was remarkable only for elevated serum and urinary ketone levels， believed to be secondary to star-vation ketoacidosis. Due to the patient's unexplained acid-base disturbance， she was kept intubated postop-eratively to allow for further workup and management.\n\n【21】Conclusions：\n\n【22】Starvation ketoacidosis is not widely recognized as a perioperative entity， and it is not well described in the medical literature. Lack of anesthesiologist awareness about this disorder may complicate the differential di-agnosis for acute intraoperative metabolic acidosis and lead to a prolonged postoperative stay and an increase in hospital costs. The short- and long-term implications of perioperative ketoacidosis are not well defined and require further investigation.\n\n【23】MeSH Keywords： Acidosis · Fasting · Ketosis\n\n【24】Full-text PDF http：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/900002\n\n【25】As the concept of Perioperative Surgical Home becomes an in-creasingly important part of the way we practice anesthesiol-ogy in the United States， the perioperative physician needs to play a progressively more important role in the coordination of patient care. The Perioperative Surgical Home is a care mod-el that has been driven by a desire for more patient-centered care combined with changes in United States healthcare re-imbursement and increased anticipated demand for health-care services 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Problems that may lead to delay or cancella-tion of surgical cases or lead to prolonged postoperative care and increased hospital costs must be triaged appropriately in order to improve patient satisfaction and decrease hospi-tal operating costs.\n\n【26】We describe the case of a young female who was in her usu-al state of health prior to diagnosis of a lumbar giant cell tu-mor requiring laminectomy. Due to a significant metabolic ab-errance secondary to ketoacidosis diagnosed intraoperatively as well as intraoperative hypotension requiring vasopressor support， she was kept intubated and transferred to the crit-ical care unit postoperatively. Her workup did not reveal any significant underlying disorder， although her metabolic acido-sis complicated her perioperative care and led to an unneces-sarily prolonged hospital admission.\n\n【27】Case Report\n\n【28】A 24-year-old， 64 kg， American Society of Anesthesiologists(ASA) Physical status I female with no prior medical histo ry was admitted through the emergency department (ED) with new-onset lower back pain and numbness and tingling in her lower extremities bilaterally. A computed tomography(CT) scan of her lumbar and thoracic spine revealed a prima-ry bone neoplasm affecting the lumbar spine with paraspinal and extradural extension， necessitating surgical biopsy and possible lumbar laminectomy. Her physical examination and vital signs were within normal limits. A paraneoplastic work-up， including measurement of serum liver function tests， vi-tamin D level， parathyroid hormone level， thyroid-stimulating hormone， free T4， free T3， erythrocyte sedimentation rate， and C-reactive protein， was unremarkable. Preoperative blood glu-cose level was 69 mg/dL\n\n【29】In the ED， prior to transfer to the operating room， 1 L of nor-mal saline (NS) was administered. The patient underwent an-esthetic induction with 50 mg of lidocaine， 100 mg of propo-fol， 100 ug of fentanyl， and 35 mg of rocuronium， followed by uneventful oral endotracheal intubation. She became hypo-tensive shortly thereafter with mean arterial pressures (MAPs) in the mid to low 50's. A radial arterial line was placed，and a\n\n【30】baseline arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed a metabolic acido-sis with a pH of 7.3， PCO2 39.9， base deficit 6， and bicarbon-ate 19.6 mEq/L. Her hemoglobin was 11.9 g/dL and glucose 55mg/dL. An additional crystalloid bolus of 1.5 L of PlasmaLyte was given， as well as 25 g of dextrose for hypoglycemia. Are-peat ABG revealed a pH of 7.29， base deficit 8， bicarbonate18.6 mEq/L， glucose 154 mg/dL， and lactic acid 0.6 mmol/L. Ketonemia was confirmed from a venous blood sample.\n\n【31】Throughout the biopsy phase of the procedure， the patient con-tinued to experience arterial hypotension， requiring frequent administration of phenylephrine and norepinephrine doses de-spite minimal blood loss. The biopsy results indicated a giant cell tumor， and the surgical team proceeded with a lumbar lam-inectomy. Total intravenous anesthesia was used to facilitate intraoperative nerve monitoring. This consisted of propofol at75-100 pg/kg/min， remifentanil at 0.05-0.2 pg/kg/min，and dexmedetomidine at 0.1-0.2 pg/kg/hr. Metabolic acidosis and hypotension persisted with a pH <7.3， requiring the adminis-tration of 50 mEq of sodium bicarbonate towards the end of surgery. Her intraoperative course was also significant for poly-uria with an average urine output of 5 mL/kg/hr. Hypotension was believed to be a result of polyuria leading to intravascu-lar hypovolemia. Thus， it was treated with goal-directed fluid therapy (total of 4 L of crystalloid and 1 L of 5% albumin) and the temporary use of a vasopressor infusion (norepinephrine0.02-0.05 pg/kg/min). Fluid administration enabled the norepi-nephrine infusion to be discontinued throughout the course of the case. The patient's serum lactic acid level remained grossly normal， indicating adequate systemic perfusion. Furthermore， the patient remained normoglycemic after the initial dose of dextrose was administered. The total case length (from begin-ning to end of anesthesia) was approximately 8 hours， while total operating time was approximately 6 hours. Throughout the intraoperative course， the highest recorded blood glucose level was 144 mg/dL\n\n【32】Given her metabolic derangement and hemodynamic insta-bility， the anesthesiologists managing the patient decided to transport the patient to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) while she was still intubated and sedated for further meta-bolic workup prior to extubation. This was remarkable for a normal serum uric acid level， serum lactate level， electrolyte levels， serum osmolality， and osmolal gap. Laboratory workup was remarkable only for elevated serum and urinary ketones. After completing this workup， the patient was extubated lat-er that evening and continued to do well at follow-up with no further complications. She was questioned about her diet and fasting prior to surgery and did not report an abnormal diet. She reported fasting for the recommended period of at least8 hours prior to her scheduled surgery time.\n\n【33】Identification and management of perioperative ketonemia are sparsely described in the medical literature. Ohkawa et al.ex-amined the incidence of ketonemia in the perioperative period通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. This observational study reported an incidence of ketone-mia of approximately 5%， although it did not affect the peri-operative management or time to extubation. Furthermore， intraoperative ketonemia as described in this observational study did not cause a significant change in pH.\n\n【34】The most common cause of ketoacidosis is diabetic ketoacido-sis due to inadequate treatment of diabetes mellit us or acute infection triggering uncontrolled hyperglycemia. Other common causes are fasting ketosis and alcoholic ketoacidosis， which usually occurs in malnourished patients with chronic alcohol-ism who have a history of binge drinking. Non-diabetic patients could develop significant acidosis due to elevated serum lac-tate level， methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning， uremic aci-dosis， strict dieting (fruitarianism， Atkins diet)， extreme exer-tion， or malnutrition with extremely poor intake 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【35】In clinical practice， fasting is seldom suspected to be the cause of significant metabolic acidosis. In an otherwise-healthy indi-vidual， mild ketosis generally develops after a 12- to 14-hour fast although pH usually remains above 7.3 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. However， when combined with physiologic stress or when there is a large giu-cose requirement， starvation may cause a severe acid-base dis-turbances 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. This exaggerated response to fasting has been described in pregnant patients， in the elderly， and in young in-fants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，6，7\\]</u>. We could not identify any cases in the literature in young， otherwise-healthy subjects. Similarly， we could not identify specific demographic risk factors that would increase the likelihood of this complication in otherwise-healthy patients.\n\n【36】The patient described above was evaluated for several poten-tial causes of perioperative anion gap metabolic acidosis in-cluding diabetic ketoacidosis，alcoholic ketoacidosis， starvation ketoacidosis， drug-induced ketoacidosis， ingestion of toxic al-cohols (e.g.，methanol， ethylene glycol)， lactic acidosis， uremia， and acute renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Calculation of the osmolar gap may be used to help differentiate between these different types of high anion gap acidosis. The osmolar gap was calculated to be normal for our patient， which，together with her normal men-tal status preoperatively and negative patient history， makes drug-induced causes unlikely. Diabetic ketoacidosis was high on our differential diagnosis， especially given the finding of polyuria and suspected osmotic diuresis. However， the patient's blood glucose levels both preoperatively and intraoperatively and the absence of a prior history of diabetes made this di-agnosis less likely. A grossly normal BUN/creatinine ruled out established renal failure， and serum lactate levels were nor-mal， which ruled out the diagnosis of lactic acidosis. Serum\n\n【37】uric acid levels combined with a grossly normal electrolyte pro-file also made tumor lysis syndrome unlikely.\n\n【38】Further post-surgical review of systems with the patient was remarkable only for a decreased appetite lasting approximate ly 1 month. She did not report a change in diet or any asso-ciated weight loss. She denied a history of smoking， alcohol， or drug use and denied using any health supplements. Thus， the diagnosis of starvation ketoacidosis was made based on the exclusion of other causes， assisted by laboratory workup revealing an elevated anion gap with elevated ketone levels in the urine and blood.\n\n【39】Adverse effects of acute metabolic acidosis primarily include decreased cardiac output， arterial dilatation with hypotension， altered oxygen delivery， decreased ATP production， predisposi-tion to arrhythmias， and impairment of the immune response通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Metabolic acidoses resulting from different organic and inorganic acids are associated with different outcomes， with some forms of metabolic acidosis (such as lactic acidosis) be-ing associated with worse outcomes than others 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Despite some convincing experimental data， no clinical trial has estab-lished the level at which pH becomes deleterious for hemody-namics， and no clinical trials have looked specifically at hemo-dynamic derangements from ketoacidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【40】Independent of the hemodynamic implications， acidosis is of-ten seen as a reflection of poororgan perfusion or poor myo-cardial function； and an acidosis seen on ABG or negative base excess may prompt additional intravenous fluid administra-tion， the use of blood products， escalation of inotropic sup-port， and initiation or prolongation of ventilatory support 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【41】Conclusions\n\n【42】This case is unique on account of the severity of ketoacidosis in the setting of acute starvation and the absence of other di-agnosed comorbidities. It illustrates the importance of recog-nizing starvation ketonemia as a perioperative entity， espe-cially in patients who have been fasted for prolonged periods of time prior to surgery. It is routine to ask patients about the time of their last meal prior to surgery in order to assess their risk of aspiration during anesthetic induction or emergence. While surgical plans are often altered by an inappropriately fasted patient， prolonged fasting is not considered harmful and it is often actively encouraged. At minimum， one must consid-er preoperative measurement of serum glucose levels in such patients as well as measurement of serum ketones in a patient presenting with an unexplained metabolic acidosis. This may help to avoid an unnecessary workup and a prolonged postop-erative course.

The origin and clinical significance of these cells are debatable and still unknown. These lesions are described under various designations from benign to malign， such as melanosis， stromal melano-cytosis or blue nevus and malign melanoma either primary or metastatic. The occurrence of mela-nin-containing cells in the endometrial stroma， which is designated as a blue nevus of the endome-trium， has been documented only twice previously. However， searching the literature for melanosis of the endometrium， namely melanin detection in both stromal and epithelial cells， not a single report was found.\n\n【10】Case Report：\n\n【11】A 45-year-old woman， having oligomenorrhea for the past 2 years， and who eventually had profuse bleeding， underwent endometrial curettage. Our case was an incidental finding of small aggre-gates of short spindle cells with finely granular， dark brown pigment in the curettage specimen. The histochemical characteristic of the pigment was melanin， and was also noted both within the glandular epithelial and the stromal cells.\n\n【12】Conclusions：\n\n【13】As a consequence， our lesion from the endometrium might be the first documented example of extracutaneous endometrial melanosis.\n\n【14】key words： endometrium · melanosis · melanin·stroma· glandular epithelium\n\n【15】Full-text PDF： http：//www.amjcaserep.com/fulltxt.php?ICID=881002\n\n【16】Word count： 1501\n\n【17】Tables： 1\n\n【18】Figures：\n\n【19】3\n\n【20】References：\n\n【21】10\n\n【22】Author's address： Handan Aker， Department of Patholog， Cumhunyet University， Faculty of Medicine， Sivas， Turkey，\n\n【23】e-mail： akerhandan@yahoo.com\n\n【24】BACKGROUND\n\n【25】Benign pigmentation of the reported cases in the female genital tract has been generally divided into two types， blue nevus and melanosis. In blue nevus， pigmentation is detect-ed only in stromal cells， whereas in melanosis pigmentation it is detected in both stromal and epithelial cells. These le-sions are extremely rare， and are most commonly identi-fied in the cervix 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-4\\]</u>. To our knowledge， melan osis in the endometrium has not been previously reported. The presented case also represents an extremely rare condition for 2 reasons. First， the origin of the melanin-containing cells is thought to be modified endometrial cells. Second， some stromal cells in the endometrium， which do not con-tain melanin， might be neuroectodermal in origin. These cells are probably the precursors of the pigmented lesions of the extracutaneus mucous membranes. In this article we report what is probably the first case of endometrial mela-nosis with histochemical and immunohistochemical find-ings， and discuss the histogenetic hypothesis， as well as the confusing terminology.\n\n【26】CASE REPORT\n\n【27】The patient was a 45-year-old white woman， gravida 3， para3. She has twins from her last pregnancy. Her menarche was at the age of 13， and she had oligomenorrhea during the preceding 2 years. Her genital examinations showed no ab-normalities. Because of prolonged history of her last vaginal bleeding， endometrial curettage was performed.\n\n【28】The small amount of endometrial biopsy showed fragmented glandular epithelium and scant pieces of stromal elements with hyalinized， amorphous， eosinophilic small aggregates of fibrin. Small aggregates of short spindle cells with finely granular dark brown pigment were noted within the stro-ma. The pigment was also present in the glandular epithe-lial cells . Pigment-containing stromal cells were located close to glandular epithelial cells that con-tained pigment granules and which also surrounded blood clots. No cellular atypia or mitotic figures were observed. To evaluate the pigment， Prussian-blue， Hematoxylin， Masson-Fontana， S-100 protein (4C4.9， Thermo Scientific)，Melan-A(A103，BioGenex)， HMB-45 (HMB45+HMB50，NeoMarkers)， CD68 (KP1，Thermo Scientific)，CD10 (56C6，NeoMarkers)， Pancytokeratin (PanCK) (AE1/AE3，NeoMarkers) were per-formed. The histochemical and immunohistochemical re-sults are shown in Table 1.\n\n【29】The pigment was negative with Prussian-blue stain for iron， and positive with Masson-Fontana and Hematoxylin meth-od for melanin. The results of the histochemical studies revealed that the pigment was melanin. The histochem-ical characteristics of melanin were detected not only in the endometrial stroma but also in the endometrial glan-dular epithelial cells. Immunohistochemically， pigment-containing cells were not immunoreactive with antibod-ies to S-100 protein， HMB-45 and， Melan-A； however， some strongly intracytoplasmic S-100 protein immunoreactive cells were noted within the stroma. These cells were round and scattered， unrelated to the melanin-containing cells. CD10 positivity， which is particularly useful for the identification of endometrial stromal neoplasms， was found in some stromal cells. CD68 positivity was found in\n\n【30】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1. Melanin-containing fragmented endometrial glandular epithelial and stromal cells. (H&E，×20).</u>\n\n【31】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2. Fragmented melanin-containing glandular epithelium and scant pieces of stromal elements. Pigment-containing stromal cells were very often located close to glandular epithelial cells and also surrounded blood clots. (H&E，×20).</u>\n\n【32】the glandular epithelial cells， melanophages and in some melanin-containing cells. We thought that the epithelial positivity might be a cross reaction. CD68 also stained the myeloid cells in the stroma. Epithelial cells were distinct-ly positively stained with PanCK. Some weak positivity was found in the melanin-containing cells. These stromal cells were not neoplastic in growth. Consequently， the case was reported as incidental/benign melanosis of the endome-trium with these histological findings， and investigated for any other melanocytic lesion.\n\n【33】Her physical examination revealed a nevus from her dor-sal side， which was 5 mm in diameter， as well as another benign slightly pigmented lesion measuring 25x5 cm lo-cated on her left inguinal region， present from her birth. However no discoloration was noted on gross examination of the vulva， vagina and the cervix. Transvaginal ultrasound examination revealed tiny endometrium. Following the his-topathological result of the endometrial biopsy， endome-trial curettage and vaginal smear were performed with an interval of 2 weeks to exclude a neoplastic lesion and eval-uate the functional status of the endometrium.The second curettage specimen was also composed of a small amount of fragmented tissue， and most of the endometrial glands\n\n【34】Table 1.

The pigment-containing cells were also present and the cytological appearance was sim-ilar to that of the first specimen， but there were very few. Cervical smear showed no abnormalities. The patient re-fused the hysterectomy since she had no complaint and had been in good health for 11 months.\n\n【40】DISCUSSION\n\n【41】Melanocytes have not been identified in the normal endo-metrium， and the occurrence of melanin pigment in the endometrium has only been associated with neoplasms， most commonly metastatic cutaneous malignant melanoma. Other very rare melanin-containing tumors of the uterine corpus were malignant mesodermal mixed tumors (carci-nosarcomas)， adenocarcinoma， retinal anlage tumor， a mel-anotic paraganglioma， and a pigmented myomatous neu-rocristoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，4，5\\]</u>.\n\n【42】The occurrence of non-neoplastic，melanin-containing cells in the endometrial stroma， designated as \"blue nevus”， is also an extremely rare phenomenon， and has been docu-mented only twice previously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Blue nevus is a benign le-sion that classically occurs on the skin and is derived from\n\n【43】the dermal melanocytes. However， in rare instances it has been reported to be found in the mucous membranes such as the mucosa of the mouth， nose， endometrium， cervix， vagina， prostate， bronchus， esophagus， and maxillary sinus通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-6\\]</u>. The melanocytes of blue nevus typically show pos-itive immunoreactivity for S-100 protein and melanocytic markers HMB-45 and Melan-A 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-6\\]</u>.\n\n【44】In blue nevus， pigmentation is detected only in stromal cells， and is more appropriately called stromal melanocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. When pigmentation is detected in both stromal and epithe-lial cells the term melanosis is used； this condition is rela-tively often reported in the prostate and in the uterine cer-vix 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，4\\]</u>. However， in the literature， the term melanosis of the prostate has referred to the presence of melanin-con-taining elongated cells in the prostatic stroma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In con-trast， intraepithelial pigment in the prostate gland has been termed as “melanosis\"or\"melanosis of the cervix\"， and has shown the presence of melanin pigment in the basal epithe-lium only 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，8\\]</u>. Although different terminology was used， the designation \"melanosis\"， indicating the presence of mel-anin-containing cells both in the stroma and the epitheli-um， is proposed as a suitable alternative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>.\n\n【45】In the male， blue nevus is mainly seen in the prostate， and in the female it is almost always restricted to the uterine cervix. According to Uehara et al.， foci of stromal melano-cytes， so-called blue nevus of the cervix， were not uncom-mon in Japanese women， occurring in 8.6%.Their lesions were initially observed in the third decade of life and be-came most prevalent in the fifth decade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【46】The origin of these pigment-containing stromal cells has been reported to be melanoblastic or melanocytic. However， the origin and pathogenesis of blue nevus of the endometri-um is controversial. The possibilities might be divided into3 groups. The first possibility is that they are derived from the abnormal migration of neural crest-derived cells during fetal development. The second possibility is that they may be derived from Schwann or perineurial cells of the periph-eral nerve fibers in the endometrium， which have acquired the ability to synthesize melanin. The aberrant differentia-tion of endometrial stromal cells toward neuroectodermal\n\n【47】tissue is the third possibility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3，9，10\\]</u>. According to these possibilities， our findings might suggest that the pigment-containing cells， either epithelial or stromal， are not true melanocytes but altered endometrial cells， although pig ment granules are accepted to be composed of melanin. In our case， the melanin-containing cells were not immung-reactive for melanocytic markers (S-100 protein，HMB-45)， as in the case presented by Shintaku et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. According to Shintaku 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> and our results， these melanin-containing cells are altered endometrial stromal cells， and are not true melanocytes. In the present case the immunoreaction of melanin-containing stromal cells with CD10 also supports our concept. CD10 is reactive for a variety of female geni-tal tract tumors， and is particularly useful for the identifica-tion of endometrial stromal neoplasms.PanCK questioned for their epithelial differentiation. CD68，reactive for some melanomas， showed positivity for macrophages and myeloid cells. Although they reacted with epithelial cells， and weak-ly reacted with some melanin-containing cells， the value was unclear. On the other hand， the presence of S-100 protein immunoreactivity in the cells among melanin-containing cells in the endometrial stroma may suggest the possibility of their neuraectodermal origin. These S-100 protein pos-itive cells didn't react with HMB-45. Normally， melanocytes do not stain for HMB-45 in intradermal nevi， but reactive or dysplastic melanocytes do 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，9，10\\]</u>. Therefore， according to the results of Ohtsuki et al.， pigment-containing， S-100protein and HMB-45 positive stromal cells， and their posi-tive staining for antibody to S-100 protein， are evidence of a neuroectodermal origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【48】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【49】This article is a brief report of a very rare case of“endo-metrial melanosis”in a 45-year-old woman. The patient complained of oligomenorrhea， and endometrial curet-tage revealed the presence of melanin pigment in both\n\n【50】endometrial stromal cells and glandular epithelial cells. Melanin-containing cells were notimmunoreactive for S-100protein，HMB45， and Melan-A. Some S-100 protein-immu-noreactive cells were noted within the stroma， but these cells did not contain melanin.\n\n【51】The origin or histogenesis of melanin-containing cells in the endometrium is controversial. Based on a review of the literature， and according to our findings， we suggest that these melanin-containing cells are derived from altered en-dometrial stromal cells.\n\n【52】REFERENCES：\n\n【53】1\\.

However， there are sev-eral risks to use TNFo inhibitors. Given the properties of TNF-o inhibitors， prevention and early detection of tu-berculosis (TB) are especially important. Even among TNF-o. inhibitors， the risk of TB infection differs accord-ing to each drug. The incidence of TB is lowest with etanercept (ETN). We present a case of urinary tract TB during treatment with ETN.\n\n【20】Case Report： A 58-year-old woman was receiving ETN for RA. Before starting ETN， isoniazid (INH) prophylaxis was started. RA was well controlled by ETN. However， 32 months after starting ETN， she noticed urinary frequency and a sen-sation of residual urine. The diagnosis was elusive， and it took 3 months until urinary tract TB was finally diag-nosed. The TB resolved with antituberculosis medication， but RA disease activity flared up after ETN was dis-continued. ETN was resumed with careful monitoring for TB recurrence. After resuming ETN， the RA was again well controlled， with no recurrence of TB.\n\n【21】Conclusions：\n\n【22】Patients should be monitored for development of TB during ETN treatment， but ETN can be used safely with careful management.\n\n【23】MeSH Keywords： Arthritis， Rheumatoid·Tuberculosis， Urogenital ·Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha\n\n【24】Full-text PDF http：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/893416\n\n【25】The treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has changed dra-matically. With early aggressive treatment， joint destruction can be prevented and the long-term prognosis may be im-proved. With the advent of biologic drugs， even patients who were previously refractory to treatment may now experience a marked decrease in RA activity. However， because tumor ne-crosis factor (TNF) -o. is a cytokine involved in cellular immuni-ty， careful monitoring for possible infection is necessary. Given the properties of TNF inhibitors， prevention and early detec-tion of tuberculosis (TB) are especially important. A medical history of TB， a chest X-ray， and interferon-gamma assay are important to take account of the prophylaxis use of anti-TB drug， isoniazid (INH) before giving TNF inhibitors.\n\n【26】Case Report\n\n【27】We present a case of a 58-year-old woman with RA. In 1999， the patient received the diagnosis of RA with symptoms of polyarthritis at the age of 49 years. She had diabetes and hy-pertension. Methotrexate (MTX) was started in 2005， and the dose was increased to 8 mg/week， but her RA activity did not decrease. Her disease classification was stage Ill class 2. The addition of ETN was considered in March 2006， and tests were performed beforehand. Routine blood test results were nor-mal except for an elevated HbA1c of 6.9%. Table 1 shows the blood test results and changes in DAS28-4/CRP. A chest X-ray and electrocardiogram showed no abnormalities.\n\n【28】The patient denied having had previous TB or contact with a TB patient， but a tuberculin skin test was weakly positive (er-ythema： 55x36 mm， no induration).\n\n【29】INH prophylaxis was started 1 month before ETN. INH200 mg/day (4.6 mg/kg) was given for 9 months. When ETN was added to the treatment regimen， the RA disease activi-ty decreased gradually. Three months after starting ETN， the patient was switched to self-injections. The dose of prednis-olone (2.5 mg/day) was gradually decreased and discontin-ued after 6 months of ETN. After 21 months of ETN， the dose of MTX was decreased to 6 mg/week. At first， the dose of ETN was 25 mg/week. After 27 months of ETN， the dose of ETN was increased to 50 mg/week. About 1 month after the ETN dose was increased， the patient experienced generalized malaise on the day of ETN injection. There were no objective signs such as fever， and the generalized malaise resolved by the next day. After 29 months of ETN， the dose of ETN was de-creased to 25 mg/week.\n\n【30】After 32 months of ETN， the patient developed urinary frequen-cy and a sensation of residual urine. The ETN was stopped， and she was evaluated by a local urologist. She was diagnosed with cystitis， and antibiotics were prescribed. After starting the an-tibiotics， the frequent urination did not improve， and the pa-tient continued to void every few hours.\n\n【31】About 3 months after the frequent urination started (after 35months of ETN)， the patient was evaluated by the Department of Urology at Fukuoka University Hospital. A urinalysis revealed sterile pyuria， so cytology and acid-fast bacilli (AFB) cultures\n\n|  | Before treatment  | 8 weeks after ETN started  | When INH discontinued  | When ETN discontinued  | When ETN resumed  | 8 weeks after ETN resumed  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| RBC (/uL)  | 447  | 454  | 468  | 395  | 434  | 429  |\n| WBC (/uL)  | 9170  | 5640  | 6360  | 7530  | 8810  | 6500  |\n| PLT(x10/uL)  | 27.6  | 21.1  | 22.2  | 17.9  | 22.9  | 19.2  |\n| AST (U/L)  | 14  | 30  | 43  | 52  | 21  | 69  |\n| ALT (U/L)  | 15  | 53  | 63  | 63  | 35  | 115  |\n| ALP (U/L)  | 324  | 329  | 418  | 254  | 312  | 223  |\n| Y-GTP (U/L)  | 21  | 52  | 54  | 78  | 33  | 75  |\n| LDH (U/L)  | 199  | 188  | 198  | 198  | 226  | 201  |\n| CRP (mg/dL)  | 1.06  | 0.13  | 0.19  | 0.23  | 2.59  | 0.45  |\n| HbA1c (%)  | 6.9  | 7.1  | 7  | 6.2  | 6.3  | 一  |\n| DAS28-4/CRP  | 3.74  | 1.33  | 1.94  | 2.09  | 6.16  | 1.41  |\n\n【33】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

TB infection was strongly suspected， so without waiting for the results of PCR， oral 4-drug anti-TB therapy (INH， pyrazinamide， etham-butol，and rifampicin) was started. The PCR results for urinary Mycobacterium tuberculosis were later found to be positive.\n\n【35】A chest X-ray and chest CT scan showed no abnormalities in the lung fields . Sputum AFB smears and cultures were also negative， and pulmonary TB was ruled out. Abdominal CT of the left kidney showed dilation of the calyces of the upper and lower poles and thinning of the parenchyma . There was mildly increased fat tissue density near the uretero-pelvic junction， and in the late phase， contrast excretion from the left kidney was decreased. The left ureteral wall was thick-ened， with narrowing of the ureteropelvic junction. There was bladder mucosal enhancement and wall thickening. Based on the results of abdominal CT， renal TB with spread of inflam-mation to the ureter and bladder was suspected. There was no outflow obstruction due to narrowing of the urinary tract on an intravenous pyelogram (IVP) . Urinary tract TB was diagnosed based on these findings.\n\n【36】The patient received oral 4-drug anti-TB therapy (INH， pyr-azinamide， ethambutol， and rifampicin) for 4 months and 3drugs orally (INH， ethambutol， and rifampicin) for another 4months. The symptoms of cystitis improved， and after anti-TB therapy was discontinued， there was no recurrence. Urinary tract culture results were negative for 2 consecutive months\n\n【37】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2. Abdominal CT scan. (A) Dilated calyces of the left kidney and decreased contrast excretion.

About 6 months after TB treat-ment was completed， the results of an interferon-gamma as-say (QuantiFERON@TB second generation) were 0.2 IU/mL. At50 months after ETN was initially started， INH 300 mg/day was started for prophylaxis. At 51 months after ETN was ini-tially started， ETN was resumed. After oral INH was restarted， mild liver dysfunction was noted， but these were improved with ursodeoxycholic acid. At 69 months after ETN was ini-tially started， the oral INH was discontinued after consulta-tion with a pulmonologist， nephrologist， and urologist. Since INH has been discontinued，there has been no TB recurrence. Figure 4 shows the clinical course of this patient.\n\n【40】ETN inhibits TNFo activity， and even in patients with MTX-resistant RA， has an excellent effect on reducing RA disease activity. However， because TNFo is a cytokine involved in cel-lular immunity， careful monitoring for possible infection is nec-essary. Given the properties of TNF inhibitors， prevention and early detection of TB are especially important.\n\n【41】TNFo plays a central role in the attack of M. tuberculosis ba-cilli by macrophages and in granuloma formation. Therefore， there is a markedly increased risk for development of TB dur-ing TNF inhibitor treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Extrapulmonary TB usually accounts for a small percentage of TB infections， but during TNF inhibitor treatment， more than half of TB infections are due to extrapulmonary TB 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-4\\]</u>. However， most patients with extrapulmonary TB during TNF inhibitor treatment have dis-seminated TB； to date， urinary tract TB has only been reported in 1 patient being treated with the TNF inhibitor infliximab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【42】Even among TNF inhibitors， the risk of TB infection differs ac-cording to each drug. In studies in England and France com-paring 3 TNF inhibitors - ETN， infliximab (IFX)， and adalimum-ab (ADA) -the incidence of TB was lowest with ETN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. In studies in Japan， the incidence of TB during ETN treatment was only about 1/3 that with IFX通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>. One of the reasons for dif-ferences in the risk of infection due to these different drugs is differences in their mechanism of action. The TNF receptor drug (ETN)， in the absence of rheumatoid factor， will itself not induce apoptosis of TNF-expressing cells. Therefore，compared to the TNF antibody drugs (IFX and ADA)， because of weaker inhibition of granuloma formation， the risk of TB infection is lower with ETN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【43】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3.

In particular， screening for latent TB infection is essential before starting ETN. Screening usually consists of a medical history， family history (determining whether any family members have TB)， imaging studies， and a tuberculin skin test. The tuberculin skin test is easy， but false-negative and false-positive results are a problematic issue. False nega-tives may occur in RA patients who are taking steroids or im-munosuppressant drugs， and with aging， negative conversion is more likely. TB infection has been reported in 3.4% of pa-tients who have a negative tuberculin test 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In addition， in populations in which the majority of persons are vaccinated with BCG， and in populations where exposure to atypical my-cobacteria is not uncommon， false-positive rates for tubercu-lin tests are high 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Therefore， this makes screening difficult with tuberculin skin tests in Japan.\n\n【47】The tuberculin skin test has been used to diagnose TB in-fection， but more recently， a blood interferon-gamma assay(QuantiFERON@TB second generation) has been developed， which is very useful for TB diagnosis and is not affected by BCG vaccination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The present patient was initially eval-uated for possible latent TB using the tuberculin skin test alone， but additional testing with an interferon-gamma assay(QuantiFERONTB second generation) might have been use-ful. Currently， all patients with a positive tuberculin test at our hospital have additional testing with an interferon-gamma as-say (QuantiFERON@TB second generation)， and since the pres-ent patient， we have not encountered TB infection during use of a TNF inhibitor.\n\n【48】The present patient had a chest X-ray before starting ETN that showed no abnormalities， and there was no prior history of TB or contact with another person who had TB. However， the tu-berculin skin test was weakly positive. In such cases with la tent TB infection， the risk of recurrence is high with ETN， and INH prophylaxis was given.\n\n【49】The Japan College of Rheumatology issued “Guidelines for TNF inhibitors in rheumatoid arthritis，\" and prophylaxis with INH 300 mg/day for 6-9 months was generally recommended. However， until revisions in 2008， there was no mention about doses in lower body weight patients. Therefore， in the present patient with a small body habitus， and who had a history of drug-related liver dysfunction with another medication， it was decided to use INH at a dose of 200 mg/day. Gomez-Reino et al. recommended that， in patients with a suspected prior his-tory of TB infection based overall from the medical history， tu-berculin skin test， and imaging findings， INH 5 mg/kg (maxi-mum 300 mg) should be given orally for at least 1 month prior to starting a TNF inhibitor. In such patients who received INH as prophylaxis for a total of 9 months， they reported no occur-rence of TB 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In the present patient， TB infection may have\n\n【50】occurred because the 4.6 mg /kg dose of INH might have been too low， with an insufficient prophylactic effect.\n\n【51】Urinary tract TB results from hematogenous spread of TB to the kidneys and further spread to the ureters and bladder. Many pa-tients are asymptomatic while the TB lesions are limited to the kidneys. When these lesions spread to the bladder， symptoms such as urinary frequency， dysuria， and a sensation of residual urine develop， which are difficult to distinguish from nonspe-cific cystitis， and hematuria and cloudy urine develop 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. The present patient had urinary frequency and a sensation of resid-ual urine， but a decrease in the percentage of patients present-ing with typical cystitis symptoms has recently been reported， so caution is necessary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. A definitive diagnosis of TB re-quires identification of M. tuberculosis in a specimen or biopsy tissue， and thus considerable time may be required until diag-nosis. Therefore， anti-TB therapy， as in the present patient， is started without waiting for a confirmatory diagnosis. The pres-ent patient finally had 2 consecutive culture results that were negative， and treatment for TB was completed after 8 months.\n\n【52】In patients with a clear history of TB infection， ETN should ide-ally not be given. However， the present patient had poor con-trol of RA disease activity after ETN was discontinued， and re-sumption of ETN had to be considered. Despite the history of TB， we thought that ETN would be safe provided that there was no latent TBinfection. Thus， we performed the interferon-gamma assay (QuantiFERON@TB second generation)， in which20.35 IU/mL is positive， with s0.1 lU/mL negative. The result was 0.2 IU/mL in the present patient， so latent TB could again not be ruled out. We considered the risk of TB recurrence when ETN was resumed， so we decided to administer anti-TB pro-phylaxis. The dose of INH was increased to 300 mg/day in an effort to more reliably prevent TB， but after resuming INH， liv-er dysfunction occurred gradually.\n\n【53】When abnormal liver function becomes a problem during INH treatment， rifampicin can also be used for prophylaxis. However， this patient also had diabetes， and to avoid increased glucose levels， the patient was not switched to rifampicin. INH was con-tinued with the addition of ursodeoxycholic acid. The currently recommended period of prophylaxis is 6-9 months. However， given the development of TB during ETN treatment in the pres-ent patient， and the fact that even after 8 months of anti-TB therapy， the interferon-gamma assay (QuantiFERONTB Sec-ond generation) had not converted to negative， we carefully considered when to discontinue prophylactic therapy. Using a multidisciplinary approach， specialists in urology， pulmonol-ogy， gastroenterology， and nephrology were consulted， and a decision was made to discontinue INH at 68 months after ETN had initially been started (18 months after ETN resumption). Since INH was discontinued. there has been no TB recurrence.\n\n【54】In conclusion， ETN is a very effective drug， but because of its mechanism of action， the risk of infection must always be con-sidered. In particular， because the incidence of TB is higher in Japan than in other developed countries， TB must always be considered in patients with infections that are difficult to di-agnose. Urinary tract TB， as in the present patient， although rare， should also be kept in mind.\n\n【55】References：\n\n【56】1\\. Keane J.

Amebic brain abscesses are a rare form of invasive amebiasis frequently lethal due to the difficulty of its diagnosis and inadeq uate treat-ment. Cerebral amebiasis poses a therapeutic challenge as evidenced by the scarcity of papers reporting com-plete recovering after treatment.\n\n【23】Case Report： We report the case of a 39-year-old Spanish man， with a history of alcohol and drug abuse. He had nevertrav-eled outside of Europe， no reported oral-anal sexual contact， and no history of immunosuppressant medica-tion. He was admitted to the Emergency department with temperature of 38℃， abdominal pain， and diarrhea. An abdominal CT scan showed multiples abscesses in the liver. Therefore， empirical meropenem treatment was started on suspicion of pyogenic liver abscesses due to lack of epidemiological risk factors for parasitic infec-tion. In the liver aspirate samples， E. histolytica trophozoites were directly visualized and a real-time PCR was also positive for it. After amebiasis diagnosis， intravenous (IV) metronidazole therapy was initiated.\n\n【24】During his admission， the patient developed pulmonary， cutaneous and cerebral involvement amebiasis. The management of amebic brain abscesses includes surgical drainage and antiparasitic treatment， in our case lV metronidazole was maintained for 10 weeks. No surgical treatment was performed and even so， the patient evolved favorablv.\n\n【25】Conclusions： Amebic brain abscesses have a high mortality rate if inadequate treatment. A timely diagnosis and suitable treat can reduce its mortality， so the diagnosis of amebic infection should not be precluded in non-endemic countries.\n\n【26】Keywords： Amebiasis·Brain Abscess· Entamoeba histolytica·Metronidazole\n\n【27】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/934188\n\n【28】口2\n\n【29】2453\n\n【30】4 15\n\n【31】Amebiasis is an emerging disease caused by the protozo-\n\n【32】an Entamoeba histolytica 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. Within the Entamoeba genus，\n\n【33】only E histolytica has been recognized to cause brain abscess. Entamoeba moshkovskii is associated with diarrhea， whereas\n\n【34】other Entamoeba species， such as Entamoeba bangladeshi or\n\n【35】Entamoeba dispar can be described as nonpathogenic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，4\\]</u>.\n\n【36】Although amebiasis infection occurs worldwide， autochthonous cases are rare in industrialized countries； and usually observed in migrants and travelers returning from endemic areas，main-ly tropical areas and low-income countries with limited socio-economic resources and poor sanitary conditions. E.histolyti-ca is a prevalent cause of traveler's diarrhea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【37】The ameba has a two-stage life cycle； the infectious form is the cyst and the invasive form is the trophozoite. Transmission is fecal-oral， generally the result of intake of cysts contained in contaminated water or food， but direct fecal-oral transmis-sion through sexual contact is also described.\n\n【38】Amebiasis can be asymptomatic in about 80-90% of cases or it can lead to the development of severe infection with ame-bic colitis and amebic liver abscess. Rarely， trophozoites can spread hematogenously to sites outside the gastrointestinal system， such as the central nervous system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>.\n\n【39】Brain abscess caused by E. histolytica is an infrequent man-ifestation of amebiasis infection and is most commonly， al-though not always， observed in patients with a concomitant liver abscess. Around 133 cases have been reported world-wide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. They are very lethal， exhibiting a mortality rate over95% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> due to the difficulty of its diagnosis and inadequate management. Treatment of amebic brain abscesses included the combination of surgical drainage and antiparasitic treat-ment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The way to determine proper treatment is to iden-tify the etiologic agent in time， as delays in its diagnosis may lead to increased mortality.\n\n【40】We describe an unusual case of disseminated amebiasis， in a non-endemic context and the true source of infection remains unclear. The patient presented intestinal amebiasis and extraint-estinal spread to liver， peritoneum， lung and brain， as well as skin lesions of amebiasis. Our case is one of the few reported cases in which brain abscesses due to amebiasis have evolved favor-ably， only with antiparasitic therapy without surgical treatment.\n\n【41】Case Report\n\n【42】Our patient was a 39-year-old Spanish man with a medical history of malnutrition， alcohol and drug abuse， smoking， and\n\n【43】pulmonary tuberculosis treated and cured. He came to the Severo Ochoa University Hospital in Leganes， a city south-west of Madrid， Spain. He was admitted to the Emergency Department with temperature of 38C， abdominal pain， and7-day diarrhea. He had no recent travel history， had never trav-eled outside of Europe， had no reported oral-anal sexual con-tact， and had no history of receiving corticosteroids or immu-nosuppressant medication.\n\n【44】On physical exam， he had tachycardia and tachypnea. Blood laboratory results revealed leucocytosis of 14x10/ (reference range， 4.0-11.0×10/l)， raised serum transaminases and inflam-matory markers， C-reactive protein level of 308 mg/l (reference range， 0.0-5.0 mg/l) and procalcitonin level of 39 ng/l (refer-ence range，<0.5 ng/l). An abdominal CT scan revealed multi-ple liver abscesses in the right liver lobe  and liver segments l and III . Empirical antibiotic treat-ment with i.v. meropenem (1g 3 times daily) was started in the Emergency Department on suspicion of pyogenic liver abscesses due to lack of epidemiologic risk factors for a parasitic infection.\n\n【45】In the next hours， the patient had acute clinical deterioration and he was transferred to surgical Intensive Care Unit (ICU). He was endotracheally intubated and mechanical ventilation was started， requiring vasopressor support due to septic shock. Owing to this worsening， it was decided to perform a percu-taneous CT-guide drainage of the liver abscesses and micro-biological samples were obtained.\n\n【46】On the 5th day of admission in ICU， liver aspirate revealed a positive visualization on the wet-mount slide of structures of15-20 um in diameter， moving by pseudopods， with granular cytoplasm and a single nucleus， compatible with E. histolytica trophozoites . Also， genomic DNA was isolated from this clinical samples using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen， Hilden， Germany) according to the manufacturer's instruc-tions. Extracted and purified DNA samples were stored at 4C until molecular processing. Detection of Entamoeba histolyt-ica DNA was performed by real-time PCR (RT-PCT)，targeting a sequence of the SSU rRNA gene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The RT-PCR technique allowed the detection of E. histolytica in a sample of liver as-pirate. In addition， the stool samples analyzed also showed a positive RT-PCR for E. histolytica. However， bacterial cultures of stool and liver aspirate samples were negative.\n\n【47】After the diagnosis of intestinal and extraintestinal amebiasis， i.v. metronidazole 750 mg 3 times daily was added to treat， followed by the luminal agent oral paromomycin， 750 mg 3times daily (35 mg/kg/day) for 7 days.\n\n【48】Because of respiratory deterioration， a thoracoabdominal CT scan was carried out and it revealed bilateral pleural effusion with an abscess in the right lower pulmonary lobe \n\n【49】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1. Thoracoabdominal and cerebral CT scans performed on admission. (A) A 78-mm amebic liver abscess in the right liver lobe.(B， C) Amebic liver abscesses in segments l and Il.

On the 10day of admission， physical exploration， amebic skin lesions ap-peared on the chest and face.\n\n【52】In addition to feces and liver aspirate samples， bronchial as-pirate， pleural drainage， blood， and skin biopsy were ana-lyzed， and RT- PCR for E. histolytica were positive in all sam-ples obtained. HIV serology and PCR for Acanthamoeba spp，\n\n【53】Balamuthia mandrillaris， and Naegleria fowleri were negative.\n\n【54】On the 15th day of ICU stay， after he was taken off sedation and mechanical ventilation， the patient presented neurological symptoms with aphasia and right-sided hemiplegia. A cranial CT scan was performed， showing multiple brain abscesses in left basal ganglia and in the right temporal lobe and right lenticular nucleus . The Neurosurgery Department was con-sulted and indicated conservative management； therefore， no\n\n【55】brain samples were obtained. The treatment of cerebral amebi-asis involved a total of 10 weeks of i.v. metronidazole therapy. Neurological symptoms improved， with full recovery of language， persisting at discharge， and a slight paresis in the right arm.\n\n【56】End-of-treatment CT scans showed residual liver  and brain abscesses .\n\n【57】Despite having various complications during his admission(co-infection of liver abscesses by Staphylococcus epidermidis and Clostridium difficile pseudomembranous colitis)， the pa-tient was discharged after a 16-week stay in the surgical ICU. He is currently stable and rehabilitating.\n\n【58】Discussion\n\n【59】Although amebiasis infection can occur worldwide， individu-als living in developing countries are at the greatest risk given poor sanitation and socioeconomic conditions. Up to 50 mil-lion people are infected with E. histolytica around the world and it is responsible for 40 000 to 100 000 deaths a year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-4\\]</u>. In developed countries like Spain， amebiasis infection is seen in migrants and travelers returning from endemic areas， or in high-risk groups， which include people who have oral-anal sex-ual practices and immunocompromised populations. In devel-oped countries， sexual contact has also emerged as an impor-tant risk factor for transmission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【60】E. histolytica is transmissible person-to-person and its trans-mission may be likely within households. However， at the time of infection our patient did not report having a stable part-ner， and did not report having oral-anal sexual activity. No se-rological studies were performed on his family members， as they were not co-habitants. In our patient， we found no ap-parent epidemiologic risk factors for the acquisition of amebi-asis， so the true source of infection could not be established.\n\n【61】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3. Abdominal and cerebral CT scan performed after treatment. (A， B) Residual lesions of liver abscesses after metronidazole therapy.

(E) Amebic brain abscesses at end of treatment， 10 weeks ofi.v. metronidazole treatment.(F) Residual lesions of amebic brain abscesses 6 months after discharge from the surgical ICU.</u>\n\n【62】Although the majority of amebic infections are asymptomatic， their invasiveness has been related to interactions between the intestinal bacterial microbiota and innate or acquired immune responses. Amebic contact can evoke various host immune mechanisms to prevent infection. Acquired immunity protects against amebic invasion by producing antibodies to the Gal/GalNAc lectin antigens and against to the EhMIF (proinflamma-tory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor)， while the innate immune response protects by releasing neutrophils at the site of invasion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. Also， the release of interferon gam-ma (IFN-y) can confer protection against E. histolytica diarrhea， especially in children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In normal circumstances， these im-mune responses confer protection； nevertheless， in some cas-es， the elicited response is excessive and thus deleterious 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【63】Host factors such as genetic susceptibility， immune status， young age， pregnancy， corticosteroid therapy， malnutrition， and alcohol abuse have been described as risk factors in the dissemination and severity of amebiasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，7\\]</u>. A sex difference in amoebic infection has also been documented， with more in-vasive disease in males； for example， over 80% of amebic liver abscesses occurin adult men 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Our patient was a young man with a history of alcoholism and malnutrition； these factors probably favored a greater invasiveness of the amebic disease.\n\n【64】Accurate differential diagnosis of parasitic diseases is an emerg-ing health problem 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In non-endemic countries， the amebia-sis diagnosis is challenging because it relies on unspecific clin-ical symptoms and laboratory tests with variable sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore， identification of these infections generally requires experienced and qualified personnel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【65】Intestinal amebiasis is diagnosed by microscopic identification of cysts and trophozoites in stool. Cysts and trophozoites (with or without hemophagocytosis) can be visualized by an experi-enced eye using microscopy， but this test lacks specificity and has low sensitivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，8\\]</u>. Moreover， microscopy cannot accu-rately differentiate between E. histolytica and species of less-er or no pathogenic potential， such E. dispar or E. moshkovskii， which are morphologically indistinguishable. In extraintestinal amebiasis disease， the microscopic analysis of aspirate sam-ples has low sensitivity (less than 20%) in the identification of trophozoites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. A PCR of extraintestinal samples always has to be performed to increase sensitivity and to confirm the species identification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【66】Tests for antigen detection in stool are easy to use and are highly sensitive in endemic areas， but with variable sensitiv-ity in non-endemic areas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>. No specific antigen tests are available for the detection of Entamoeba dispar and Entamoeba moshkovskii from clinical samples 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Also， stool antigen de-tection only has 40% sensitivity for the diagnose of amebic liver abscess.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【67】Serology is both highly sensitive and specific， and is a use-ful complement to stool studies. As a disadvantage， serolo-gy remains positive for a long time after infection， so its use is limited in endemic areas. Antibody detection is most use-ful to diagnose of amebic liver abscess and other forms of ex-traintestinal disease， in case the stool studies are negative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【68】Molecular analysis by RT-PCR based assays is the criterion standard for diagnosis of amebiasis， discriminating between\n\n【69】Entamoeba histolytica and Entamoeba dispar 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，7，8\\]</u>. RT-PCR is\n\n【70】the most sensitive method for detecting amebiasis in stool or abscess fluid. In our case， the diagnosis was established by microscopy of the liver abscess sample and was confirmed by RT-PCR of the liver abscess，stool， pleural fluid， and blood and skin biopsy samples.\n\n【71】The liver is the most frequent extraintestinal organ affected by amebiasis， presenting as amebic liver abscess (ALA). It is7-10 times more likely among adult men with amebic infec-tion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. Radiology cannot determine the etiology. In devel-oped countries， the differential diagnosis of ALA should in-clude the pyogenic liver abscess， hepatoma， and echinococcal cyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. In our case， the absence of trave. to endemic areas led us to miss the initial diagnosis of amebiasis.\n\n【72】Complications of ALA include rupture with extension to the peritoneum， pleura， pericardium， and hematological spread. However， routine drainage is not usually required and should be reserved for cases with no response to treatment in the first72 h or if there is high risk of rupture： diameter >5 cm， less than 1 cm between the abscess wall and the liver surface，or left lobe abscess 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-4\\]</u>. In our patient， drainage of the abscess allowed a confirmatory diagnosis and appropriate treatment.\n\n【73】Pulmonary complications are the second most frequent ex-traintestinal complication (7-20% of patients with ALA)； it can be derived of direct ALA rupture through the diaphragm or hematogenous spread. In general， amebic pleural effusions and abscess can be easily treated with drainage and antimi-crobial therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【74】The majority of cutaneous amebiasis is described by the con-tiguous spread in the anogenital region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Our patient de-veloped cutaneous amebiasis， localized on the chest and face， without cutaneous involvement in the peri-anal area. Cutaneous amebiasis is extremely rare； the para-site can be transmitted from contiguous spread， contaminat-ed patient\\`s fingers after scratching， or by parasitemia. We suspect the latter was the most probable underlying mecha-nism in our patient (RT- PCR was positive in the blood sam-ples， suggesting hematogenous spread).\n\n【75】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4. Images of cutaneous amebiasis lesions present on chest (A) and face (B).</u>\n\n【76】Amebic brain abscesses are extremely rare and arise almost exclusively alongside amebic lung or liver abscess 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Victoria-Hernandez et al reported 133 cases worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， with a mor-tality rate over 95%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> due to the difficulty of its diagnosis (CT images of E. histolytica abscesses are indistinguishable from those CT images of abscesses due to other organisms) or due to inadequate treatment， especially if drainage is not performed通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6，12，13\\]</u>. In many published cases of cerebral amebiasis， the diagnosis is made postmortem 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In the literature，there are few cases of cerebral amebiasis that evolved well despite not receiving surgical treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，15\\]</u>.\n\n【77】Treatment of invasive amebic infection requires the use of an amebicidal tissue-active agent， such as metronidazole or ti-nidazole， followed by a luminal cysticidal agent like paromo-mycin or diloxanide， to eradicate colonization. A 5-to 10-day course of therapy is recommended in amebic colitis and a 10-day course in the cases with amebic liver abscess 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. However， there is no consensus on the duration of the therapy in brain abscesses； up to 8 weeks are described in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，13\\]</u>.\n\n【78】The approach to amebic brain abscesses includes the combina-tion of surgical drainage and antimicrobial treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Owing the paucity of literature on the duration of therapy， a longer treatment period may be warranted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，13\\]</u>. In our case， met-ronidazole was withdrawn after 10 weeks of treatment until a neurological improvement was observed， alongside a reduction of brain lesions in the cranial CT scan. Surprisingly， the patient had a good evolution even in the absence of surgical treat-ment， contrary to what has been published in the literature.\n\n【79】We report a patient with invasive amebiasis， with amebic ce-rebral affecting， who responded well to medical therapy. The patient survived with prolonged metronidazole therapy， un-treated surgically. Our case is one of the few reported cases in Spain of amebic brain abscess with a good outcome as a re-sult of a timely diagnosis and suitable treatment.\n\n【80】Conclusions\n\n【81】Amebic brain abscess has a high mortality rate if inadequate-ly managed. The possibility of amebic infection should not be ruled out in non-endemic countries； early recognition of inva-sive amebiasis contributes significantly in reduce its morbidity and mortality. However， the need for surgery or the duration of amebicidal therapy in amebic brain abscess remains a mat-ter of debate. Further investigations will help in the manage-ment of this severe disease when cerebral spread is presented.\n\n【82】Acknowledgements\n\n【83】We thank the patient and his family for granting permission to publish this information.\n\n【84】Declaration of Figures’ Authenticity\n\n【85】All figures submitted have been created by the authors who confirm that the images are original with no duplication and have not been previously published in whole or in part.\n\n【86】1\\.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by a deficiency of a disintegrin-like and me-talloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motifs 13 (ADAMTS13)， and results in thrombotic microangiopa-thy. Influenza virus causes thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura by inducing immunoglobulin G autoantibod-ies against ADAMTS13. We report a rare case of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura caused by influenza A without anti-ADAMTS13 antibody that was treated by plasma exchange.\n\n【27】Case Report： A 57-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of hypoxemia. We diagnosed pneumonia and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Despite treatment， she developed thrombocytopenia， and we diag-nosed thrombotic microangiopathy and started plasma exchange. With a PLASMIC score of 6 points and neu-ropsychiatric symptoms， we strongly suspected thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and started rituximab. However， ADAMTS13 activity by FRETS-VWF73 assay was 65%， and anti-ADAMTS13 antibody was negative. After 4 plasma exchanges and 2 rounds of rituximab， platelet numbers and lactate dehydrogenase and creati-nine concentrations normalized on the 16t day of hospitalization. Subsequently， influenza A (H1N1) was iden-tified in a nasopharyngeal swab collected on admission. Plasma enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing for chromogenic ADAMTS13 activity showed a significant decrease (<0.5%). Therefore， we diagnosed throm-botic thrombocytopenic purpura caused by influenza A without anti-ADAMTS13 antibody.\n\n【28】Conclusions： We present a rare case of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura without anti-ADAMTS13 antibody caused by influenza A virus successfully treated by plasma exchange. Influenza A may reduce ADAMTS13 activity with-out inducing autoantibodies.\n\n【29】Keywords： Influenza A virus· Plasma Exchange · Purpura， Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic·Thrombotic Microangiopathies\n\n【30】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/932251\n\n【31】品11463 2 山2\n\n【32】Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a syndrome character-ized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA)， thrombo-cytopenia， and organ damage owing to microvascular throm-bosis. TMA is classified as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)， thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)， atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS)， and secondary TMA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. TMA has a rapid progression of symptoms and a high mortality rate， and even in surviving patients， organ damage is common； there-fore， early diagnosis and emergency treatment， including plas-ma exchange， are important 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>.\n\n【33】TTP is caused by a congenital or acquired deficiency of a dis-integrin-like and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type1 motifs 13 (ADAMTS13)， a von Willebrand factor-cleaving en-zyme， which prevents cleavage of the ultra-large von Willebrand factor multimer (UL-VWFM)， resulting in platelet aggregation， platelet thrombus formation， and TMA. The diagnosis of TTP is based on a marked decrease in ADAMTS13 activity (<10%). TTP treatment involves plasma therapy，such as with fresh fro-zen plasma infusion and plasma exchange 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-6\\]</u>.\n\n【34】TTP is classified into 2 forms： congenital (familial) and ac-quired TTP. Acquired TTP is caused by the production of im-munoglobulin (Ig) G-type autoantibodies against ADAMTS13， which is called immune-mediated TTP (iTTP)， while congenital\n\n【35】TTP (Upshaw-Schulman syndrome； USS) is caused by a congen-ital deficiency of ADAMTS13； acquired TTP is the most com-mon form (>95%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-6\\]</u>.Anti-ADAMTS13 antibody is the key finding in the diagnosis of acquired TTP.\n\n【36】Influenza virus causes TTP by inducing IgG autoantibodies against ADAMTS13， resulting in decreased ADAMTS13 ac-tivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.

On day 3 of hospitalization， the platelet count decreased dramatically and the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration increased markedly. Thrombocytopenia persisted despite platelet transfusion.On day 8， we diagnosed TMA because of the presence of fragmented erythrocytes in the blood smear， thrombocytopenia， and elevated LDH concentration， and we initiated plasma exchange therapy. We administered rituximab on day 8 because the patient had neuropsychiatric symptoms. After 4 plasma exchanges and rituximab once a week for 2 weeks， platelet numbers and LDH concentration normalized on day 16. The result of chromogenic ADAMTS13-act-ELISA was <0.5%. The patient was discharged home on day 41， and we subsequently submitted a nasopharyngeal specimen collected on admission to the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment， which identified influenza A virus infection. Therefore， we finally diagnosed secondary TTP associated with influenza A virus.0</u>\n\n【49】We diagnosed respiratory failure owing to pneumonia of un-known cause and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Considering bacterial pneumonia， atypical pneumonia， acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia， and influenza pneu-monia as factors contributing to respiratory failure， we start-ed ceftriaxone 2 g/day， levofloxacin 500 mg/day， steroid pulse therapy (methylprednisolone 1 g/day for 3 days)， and perami-vir 600 mg. Recombinant human thrombomodulin 380 U/kg was used to treat the DIC\n\n【50】On the third day of hospitalization， the patient's platelet count decreased to 37.0x103/pL， and platelet transfusion was per-formed； however， the platelet count remained low. On the 8th day， we diagnosed the patient with TMA due to the presence of fragmented erythrocytes in the blood smear， thrombocytopenia， elevated LDH concentration， and renal dysfunction ，and we initiated plasma exchange. The stool culture and serum anti-body levels for enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli were negative， heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) antibody， and other au-toantibodies . She showed neuropsychiatric symptoms such as restlessness and delirium， and the PLASMIC score was 6points， which indicated severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. We admin-istered rituximab because we suspected immune-mediated TTP. However， ADAMTS13 activity tested by the FRETS-VWF73 assay was 65%， and anti-ADAMTS13 antibody was negative .\n\n【51】We performed 4 plasma exchanges at 50 mL/kg/day and admin-istered rituximab at 375 mg/m² once a week for 2 weeks. On the 16h day， platelet numbers returned to the normal range， and LDH and creatinine concentrations normalized. Antimicrobial therapy was terminated on the 7h day. After pulse therapy， the corticosteroid was tapered over 2 weeks because almost all autoantibodies， including anti-ADAMTS13 antibody， were negative. During the course of treatment， the patient devel-oped a rectal ulcer and pulmonary embolism， which improved with treatment； she was discharged to home on the 41\" day. Three months after discharge， the patient had not relapsed； Figure 2 shows her progress during hospitalization.\n\n【52】Subsequently， we submitted the nasopharyngeal sample collected on admission to the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment， which identified influenza A vi-rus (H1N1) infection. Plasma was collected at the same time as the samples submitted for the FRETS-VWF73 assay， for en-zyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing for chro-mogenic ADAMTS13 activity， to the Department of Blood Transfusion Medicine， Nara Medical University， which identi-fied a significant decrease (<0.5%). We therefore diagnosed the patient as having TTP caused by influenza A without an-ti-ADAMTS13 antibody. After plasma exchange and without immunosuppressive therapy， the ADAMTS13 activity 2 weeks\n\n【53】after initial treatment was 25.5% and the patient did not have relapse of TTP.\n\n【54】Discussion\n\n【55】This was a case of TMA of unknown cause that was successful-ly treated with plasma exchange. Initially， ADAMTS13 activity was not significantly decreased and autoantibodies were neg-ative， but later， ADAMTS13 activity was markedly decreased. The cause of the TMA was influenza A (H1N1).\n\n【56】The present case is considered anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibody-negative acquired TTP. Because the patient experienced no relapse， and the ADAMTS13 activity increased without im-munosuppressive therapy， the possible pathogenesis of TTP is non-immune-mediated TTP. We administered recombinant soluble thrombomodulin to treat the DIC Although soluble thrombomodulin inhibits ADAMTS activity in vitro 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， it did not cause the acquired TTP in the present case because the FRETS-VWF73 showed normal ADAMTS13 activity. Therefore， influenza A virus (H1N1) may inhibit ADAMTS13 without in-ducing autoantibodies.\n\n【57】ADAMTS13 activity tested by the FRETS-VWF73 assay was not significantly decreased， while its activity tested by the chromo-genic ADAMTS13-act-ELISA assay showed a marked reduction. The possible reasons why these 2 methods showed significantly different results may be differences in the substrate between these assays. Because the FRETS-VWF73 assay showed suf-ficient ADAMTS13 activity in this case， the ADAMTS13 cleav-age site of the FRETS-VWF73 substrate may be overexposed compared to that of the human von Willebrand factor. The ADAMTS13 cleavage site of von Willebrand factor may be come hidden upon the binding of GST and His tags to VWF73， because the clinical course clearly matched the results of the chromogenic ADAMTS13-act-ELISA assay. Comparisons ofthe sensitivity of these 2 assays have been heterogeneous 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>； thus， similar TTP cases may have been inaccurately undiag-nosed by the FRETS-VWF73 assay.\n\n【58】Our patient showed signs of DIC. The findings in patients with TMA are similar to those in patients with DIC， namely thrombo-cytopenia and organ damage. Patients with TMA require ear-ly diagnosis and treatment because of the rapid progression， high mortality rate， and high incidence of organ damage， even in surviving patients， while patients with DIC are mainly treat-ed by treating the underlying disease. TMA is not associated with coagulopathy， generally. As reported by Wada et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> and previous reports of TTP owing to influenza 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12-15\\]</u>，TMA and DIC can be associated. It is important to diagnose TMA even in the presence of coagulopathy.\n\n【59】Definitive differentiation between TTP， HUS related to Shiga-toxin-secreting Escherichia coli infection (STEC-HUS)， aHUS， and secondary TMA is impossible at TMA diagnosis. The use-fulness of plasma exchange for TMA has been established， es-pecially in TTP. As stated in the Japanese and British guide lines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-6\\]</u>， once TMA is diagnosed， plasma exchange should be started as soon as possible because of the possibility of TTP. Plasma exchange therapy is considered useful in supplement-ing ADAMTS13， removing autoantibodies to ADAMTS13，sup-plementing normal-sized VWF， and removing UL-VWFM and excess cytokines. Samples should be collected to differentiate secondary TMAs before plasma exchange. If there is a caus-ative disease that triggers TMA， treatment of that disease is essential. However， in the case of TMA caused by pneumoCOC-cal infection， care should be taken because the disease wors-ens with plasma exchange.\n\n【60】Conclusions\n\n【61】We present a rare case of TTP without anti-ADAMTS13 anti-body caused by influenza A virus (H1N1) successfully treated by plasma exchange. Influenza A may reduce ADAMTS13 activ-ity without inducing autoantibodies. Once TMA is diagnosed， plasma exchange should be started as soon as possible be-cause the immediate differentiation of the causes of TMA is difficult. Efforts to differentiate the underlying causes should be made to determine subsequent treatments.\n\n【62】Acknowledgements\n\n【63】The authors would like to thank Masanori Matsumoto， MD， PhD， for performing the testing for ADAMTS13 activity by chro-mogenic ADAMTS13-act-ELISA assay.\n\n【64】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【65】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【66】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Declaration of Figures Authenticity</u>\n\n【67】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All figures submitted have been created by the authors who confirm that the images are original with no duplication and have not been previously published in whole or in part.</u>\n\n【68】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

Materials and methods： The prospective clinical study was performed on 36 patients (26 males and ten females) with mandibular condylar fractures. These patients were divided into two groups of 18 each. In the first group， fixation was achieved with a single miniplate， and in the second group， fixation was achieved with two miniplates. Fractures were classified based on classification given by Spiessel and Schroll 通用删除7(英):<u>(1972)</u> All the fractures included in the study were subjected to open reduction and internal fixation. The choice of approach and fixation was planned to depend upon fracture level by the operating surgeon before surgery. All these patients were assessed for follow up over 6 months postoperatively. Results： The study showed that complications like occlusal derangement， change in fracture segment position after achieving good intraoperative reduction and deviation of the mouth towards the fracture side were more commonly seen in the patients treated with a single miniplate. Though other complications were also seen more in patients treated with a single miniplate， the11number was statistically insignificant. Conclusion： Patients treated with two miniplates showed fewer complications when compared to patients treated with a single miniplate. Follow up period showed better occlusal stability and TMJ function with two miniplates. As our study sample size is small， it is difficult to comment on the statistical significance of the plating system used. We suggest that whenever possible， two miniplates should be used to fix the condylar fractures as it provides more stable fixation.\n\n【4】KEYWORDS Condyle fracture， miniplates， open reduction internal fixation， Incisal opening\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Among facial bone fractures， the mandible is one of the fre-quently fractured sites， with condylar fractures ranging between17.5% and 52%.

Its displacement is dependent on degree， mag nitude， direction and precise point of application of the force. It also depends on dentition and the occlusal position.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>\n\n【13】The management of condylar fracture remains a topic of con-troversy. Two main treatment modalities include conservative and surgical approach. Both the approaches have indications and contraindications as well as their advantages and disad-vantages.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> In recent years， the surgical approach， i.e. open reduction with internal fixation， COIhas become more common be-cause of a better understanding of anatomy and the use of newer instruments and techniques. With open treatment， the condylar\n\n【14】process can regain pre-traumatic position or close to position， which will re-establish normal mandibular position and bring teeth in proper occlusal relation. Zide and Kent have thrown more light on the absolute and relative indications of open re-duction and internal fixation.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>\n\n【15】By following Champy et al.， a single miniplate is commonly used for fixation of the condylar fracture.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> However use of two plates have also been advocated.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u> In vitro studies have shown better results with two miniplates for fixation of the condylar fractures.7\\]\n\n【16】At the same time， it is believed that incorporation of more hardware in a very small anatomic area can lead to many other postoperative complications such as infection or compromised vascularity. Our study compares the outcome following open reduction and internal fixation of the condylar fractures using either a single plate or two miniplates on various postoperative parameters.\n\n【17】Aim\n\n【18】To evaluate the functional outcome and stability by comparing the single miniplate versus two miniplates for open reduction and internal fixation of mandibular condylar fractures.\n\n【19】Material and Methods\n\n【20】Selection criteria\n\n【21】Inclusion criteria\n\n【22】1\\.

Detailed history and clinical examination were recorded in a specially prepared case history proforma. 2mm stainless steel miniplate osteosynthesis technique was used for the fixa-tion of these fractures. The radiographs taken were OPG and Reverse Towne's projection. Whenever required， 2D or 3D CT scans were taken as a diagnostic adjuvant.

The choice of approach and fixation was planned according to the level of the fracture. In the postoperative pe-riod， these patients were evaluated on various parameters for a follow-up period of 6 months at intervals of day 1， day 2， day 8， 15 days， one month， two months and six months. Maxil-lomandibular fixation was applied postoperatively in patients with gross occlusal derangement.

Twenty-six were men， and10 were women. The highest number (i.e. 16) of fractures ob-served belonged to a low displaced subcondylar fracture pattern(Spiessel and Schroll type II). Most of these patients were hav-ing other mandibular fractures， mainly in the parasymphyseal region on the contralateral side.\n\n【64】Results were tabulated and subjected to statistical analysis comparing the two groups.\n\n【65】These results were subjected to statistical analysis and com-pared by using the GRAPH PAD PRISOM 8.2.1 software. This analysis showed a statistically significant difference in three parameters， namely deviation of the mandible towards the frac-tured side， occlusal derangement and change in the fracture segment position， were seen in 6 out of 18 patients treated using a single miniplate， all the complications mentioned above were seen in same six patients.

Similar to other studies， more complications have been observed in pa-tients with a single miniplate. Postoperatively occlusal derange-ment， change in fracture segment position after good intraopera-tive reduction and deviation of mandible towards fracture side were seen only in patients treated by single miniplate. Though other complications were seen more in the patients treated with a single miniplate than two miniplates， results were statistically insignificant.\n\n【87】We have observed resorption of the condylar segment in one patient treated with a single miniplate whereas no patient showed this complication in the group treated by using two miniplates. This finding is in contrast to the belief that two miniplates incorporate extra hardware in smaller anatomic areas， leading to compromised vascularity and necrosis of the condylar segment.\n\n【88】OPG and Reverse Towne's view are commonly used for the diagnosis of condylar fracture. Two dimensional and three di-mensional computed tomography (2D and 3D CT) are useful when plain radiographs are insufficient to visualize the fracture pattern.18\\]\n\n【89】In our study， we have taken 2D， and 3D CT scans of the patients whenever there was any diagnostic dilemma regarding the fracture pattern encountered； we have also observed that the3D CT scans provide better visualisation of the fracture pattern and hence help in treatment planning.\n\n【90】The age of the patient has a bearing on treatment. In children under three years， the fracture is usually of the compression type because of condyle stubbiness. In children between 3 and11 years of age， the fracture is linear.

The need for open reduction is greater so that optimal anatomic alignment can be achieved.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> In our study， individuals above 18 years of age have been in-cluded.\n\n【91】The standard preauricular approach for high and medially displaced condylar fractures and retromandibular for the low-level condylar fractures. The preauricular approach was used in22 patients， whereas the retromandibular approach was used in14 of the patients.\n\n【92】As known with the standard preauricular approach， the chances of transient facial nerve palsy are very common when compared to other approaches， and our study recorded 6 pa-tients with transient facial nerve palsies treated with standard preauricular approach when observed during the immediate postoperative period irrespective of the type of plating system used. These patients were managed medically with steroid therapy without any surgical intervention， which has reversed within 8-12 weeks.\n\n【93】Oedema， decreased interincisal distance， facial nerve weak-ness， and infection were similar in both groups affecting an equal number of patients. TMJ dysfunction was seen in 2 pa-tients treated using a single miniplate whereas none of the pa-tients in the second group had TMJ dysfunction. This was seen in patients with changes in the fracture segment position after achieving good intraoperative reduction.\n\n【94】The delayed complications like plate bending， screw loos-ening and resorption of the condylar head were seen in one of the patients treated with a single miniplate. Also， this patient presented with an infection. Another patient in two miniplates groups presented with the infection without any other delayed complications as seen in the previous case. Though all these complications were seen during the early postoperative period， they were resolved during subsequent follow-up. Our study showed more complications seen in the group treated using a single miniplate than in the group treated using two miniplates.\n\n【95】The small sample size and limited follow-up could be consid-ered the limitation of the study.\n\n【96】Conclusion\n\n【97】The following conclusions can be drawn from our study Patients with two miniplates had fewer complications when compared to patients treated with a single miniplate. Follow up of the patients suggested better occlusal stability and TMJ function with two miniplates. As our study sample size is small， it is diffi-cult to comment on the plating methods' statistical significance. Though all the complications resolved during subsequent follow up in both single and two miniplate groups， every opportu-nity should be utilised whenever possible to use two miniplates to fix displaced condylar fractures. It provides stable fixation compared to the use of a single miniplate.\n\n【98】Funding\n\n【99】This work did not receive any grant from funding agencies in the public， commercial， or not-for-profit sectors.\n\n【100】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of interest</u>\n\n【101】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There are no conflicts of interest to declare by any of the authors of this study.</u>\n\n【102】通用结尾删除-1:<u>References</u>\n\n【103】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

It is an extrapul-monary complication of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis infection. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is a NOS 2A gene polymorphism so that patients are susceptible to tuberculosis spondylitis. This study is an analytical cross-sectional study on 36 Spinal tuberculosis patients at the Wahidin Sudirohusodo Hospital in Makassar who had tested positive TB geneXpert and took five cc of blood samples in EDTA tubes. Then DNA extraction and genotyping examination with PCR techniques were carried out.\n\n【6】There were 39 subjects in this study 39 TB spondylitis patients (84.8%) and seven controls (15.2%). Most of them were women (58.7%)， aged between 20-29 years (41.3%). Based on PCR results， only two subjects experienced a gene mutation(4.3%) in the A-277G single nucleotide. The NOS2A gene polymorphism is a cause of susceptibility to spinal tuberculosis.\n\n【7】KEYWORDS Spinal Tuberculosis， Polymorphism， Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase， NOS 2A\n\n【8】Introduction\n\n【9】Tuberculous spondylitis is one of the oldest diseases known to humans.

NO is formed when the guanido group of essential amino acids L-arginine splits to form NO and L-citrulline. The reaction is catalyzed by a class of enzymes called NO synthases (NOS). Three NOS species were characterized， and their NOS genes were identified. NO is produced constitutively by endothelial (eNOS or NOS3) or neuronal (nNOS or NOS1) synthase， or in higher concentrations by induced synthase (iNOS or NOS2). NOS2 is induced by several cytokines including IFN-g， IL-1b， and TNF-a and by\n\n| Variable  |  | n  | %  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Variable  |  | 39  | 84.8%  |\n| Group  | Tuberculous Spondilitis  | 39  | 84.8%  |\n|  | Control  | 7  | 15.2%  |\n| Age  | <20  |  | 8，7%  |\n|  | 20-29  |  | 413%  |\n|  | 30-39  |  | 23，9%  |\n|  | 40-49  |  | 174%  |\n|  | \\>=50  |  | 8，7%  |\n| Sex  | Male  | 19  | 413%  |\n|  | Female  | 27  | 587%  |\n| PCR Result  | Mutation  | 2  | 4，3%  |\n|  | Non Mutation  | 44  | 95，7%  |\n\n【23】Table 2 The distribution of PCR results based on the sex of the NOS 2A gene mutations\n\n|  | PCR Result  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  | Non  |  |\n| Sex  | Mutation  | Mutation  | Total  |\n| Male  | 0  | 19  | 19  |\n| Female  | 2  | 25  | 27  |\n| Total  | 2  | 44  | 46  |\n\n【25】Table 3 Distribution of PCR results based on the age of the Datient.\n\n|  | PCR Result  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age  | Mutation  | Non Mutation  | Total  |\n| <20  | 0  | 4  | 4  |\n| 20-29  | 0  | 19  | 19  |\n| 30-39  | 0  | 11  | 11  |\n| 40-49  | 1  | 7  | 8  |\n| \\>=50  | 1  | 3  | 4  |\n| Total  | 2  | 44  | 46  |\n\n【27】Table 4 PCR Result and Group Distribution\n\n|  | Group  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Tuberculosis  |  |  |\n| PCRResult  | Spondilitis  | Control  | Total  |\n| Mutation  | 2  | 0  | 2  |\n| Non mutation  | 37  | 7  | 44  |\n| lotal  | 39  | 7  | 46  |\n\n【29】endotoxin in inflammation.

Intratracheal administration of virulent M. tuber-culosis in mice stimulates the production of NOS2 and NO in alveolar macrophages.

It has been proposed that NO produced by human macrophages infected with TB and by epithelial cells is also antimycobacterial against M. tuberculosis.\n\n【32】Nonetheless， some reports show that alveolar macrophages from TB patients produce an increase in the amount of NO com-pared to healthy control subjects. Wang et al. showed that an increase in NO exhalation in patients with TB was due to the regulation of NOS2A in alveolar macrophages. In contrast to the function of NO which is inferred from mice (as a molecule of my-cobacteria)， it can also participate in the formation of protective granulomas.14-17\\]\n\n【33】Although the expression of NOS2 is usually undetectable in human macrophages from cell lines or macrophages de-rived in vitro from healthy human blood monocytes， alveolar\n\n【34】macrophages and tissue from the lungs of tuberculous patients show a high functional level of NOS2. Polymorphism in the induced nitric oxide synthase gene is associated with tubercu-losis. Also， infected lung tissue from TB patients shows high nitrotyrosine levels， NOS activity products， and increased NOS2activity.18，19\\]\n\n【35】NOS2 is encoded by a polymorphic gene known as NOS2A on chromosome 17q11.2-q12. Several single nucleotide poly-morphisms (SNPs) and microsatellites have been described. Apart from some conflicting results， a highly polymorphic pen-tanucleotide (CCTTT) microsatellite located in the promoter region of NOS2A has been indicated to be important function-ally in the NOS2A transcription regulation. The association of microsatellites (CCTTT) has been reported in autoimmune diseases and infections. Also， the polymorphism in the proxi-mal promoter involving the insertion or removal of replicated TAAA units is associated with an increased risk of inflammatory disorders.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20，21\\]</u>\n\n【36】NOS2A gene polymorphism is closely related to suscepti-bility to infectious diseases， one of which is TB infection.

M. hominis lacks a rigid cell wall and cannot be clearly visualized by routine light microscopy. Thus， it is challenging to diagnose infections caused by this pathogen. Here， we re-port a case of Mycoplasma hominis causing iatrogenic ventriculitis secondary to extraventricular drain.\n\n【20】Case Report：\n\n【21】A 25-year-old man who was a victim of a road traffic accident developed M. hominis ventriculitis secondary to extraventricular drain. Despite a delay in the diagnosis due to the difficulty of identifying M. hominis， the pa-tient was successfully treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin 400 mg for 14 days.\n\n【22】Conclusions：\n\n【23】The findings of this case report， coupled with a thorough review of the literature， demonstrate the pathogenic potential of M. hominis. Particularly in developing countries， in which laboratories may have limited access to advanced technologies， such rare infectious diseases remain major diagnostic challenges.\n\n【24】MeSH Keywords：\n\n【25】Central Nervous System Diseases · Cerebral Ventriculitis·Cross Infection· Meningitis·\n\n【26】Mycoplasma Hominis\n\n【27】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/914284\n\n【28】口11317 2 山节2 ￥24\n\n【29】1 Department of Microbiology， King Fahd Hospital of the University Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University Al Khobar， Saudi Arabia2 Department of Internal Medicine， King Fahd Hospital of the University Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University Al Khobar Saudi Arabia\n\n【30】Mycoplasma hominis is a small free-living organism belonging to the genus Mycoplasma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

Moreover， the lack of a cell wall prevents visualization of Mycoplasma spe-cies by Gram staining and makes the organism resistant to cell wall inhibitors such as beta-lactam antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. It is very challenging and resource-and time-consuming to diagnose in-fections caused by this organism because of the requirement for special selective medium and specific incubation conditions for culturing M. hominis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Furthermore， there are few biochemi-cal traits that are valuable for diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Accordingly， matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrom-etry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been adopted as a cost-effective， rapid， reliable method for the diagnosis of M. hominis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【31】M. hominis generally colonizes the urogenital tracts of sexually active adults and is a causative organism of urogenital tract infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Central nervous system (CNS) infections due to M. hominis are rare. To best of our knowledge， only 21 cases of CNS infection caused by M. hominis， including our current case， have been reported in the literature.\n\n【32】Here， we present a successfully treated case of M. hominis ven-triculitis secondary to extraventricular drain. This is the first case of M. hominis causing CNS infection reported in a coun-try in the Middle East.\n\n【33】Case Report\n\n【34】A 25-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room as a victim of a motor vehicle crash. His Glasgow coma score was8/15， and he was therefore electively intubated and attached to mechanical ventilation. Whole-body computed tomography(CT) was performed， yielding the following findings： CT of the spine showed a nondisplaced compression fracture at the ninth and 10th thoracic vertebrae； CT of the chest showed bilateral basal atelectasis/consolidation likely related to aspiration， with bilateral ground-glass opacities and nondisplaced manubrium sternal fracture； CT of the abdomen showed a small (0.5 cm) contusion over the spleen； CT of the head showed an acute left subdural hemorrhage with underlying mild brain edema and a right midline shift of approximately 1 cm.\n\n【35】Based on these findings， emergency decompressive craniectomy with extraventricular drain (EVD) insertion was performed. He was then admitted to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) and maintained on mechanical ventilation. On day 5， he devel-oped fever with leukocytosis； septic workup， including cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) analysis and culture， indicated EVD-related ventriculitis， and the patient was administered vancomycin\n\n【36】and meropenem. However， the antibiotic regimen was adjusted based on culture results ， and the patient received a full course of lipid-formulated amphotericin B and vanco-\n\n【37】mycin (for Candida albicans and Staphylococcus hemolyticus).\n\n【38】After 8 days， the EVD was removed. Four days later， he devel-oped deterioration of consciousness， and a new CT scan of the brain showed active hydrocephalus  with a worsening midline shift. Hence，another EVD was inserted， and a full sep-tic workup was performed .\n\n【39】On day 18， he underwent debridement at the cephalic sur-gical site， and a full course of ceftazidime was administered owing to wound infection. On day 25， the patient underwent tracheostomy placement. Postoperatively， he became febrile， and his Glasgow coma scale remained at 8/15. Leukocytosis(14.3 k/pL) was also observed， and another septic screening was performed； the results of CSF culture revealed M. hominis. The same isolate regrew from a confirmatory sample on day 28. The next day， the second EVD was changed， and he was administered intravenous ciprofloxacin 400 mg every 8 h for a total duration of 14 days. On day 39， the patient was clin-ically improved and transferred to the general ward. The third EVD remained in place until day 45. He was maintained on na-sogastric feeding and tracheostomy. A few days later， he was transferred to another health care facility upon his employer's request. The patient did not follow up with our facility after that.\n\n【40】Microbiology laboratory findings\n\n【41】Yellowish clear CSF samples from EVD were inoculated on sheep blood agar， MacConkey agar， chocolate agar， anaerobic blood agar， and thioglycolate broth， incubated at 37℃ according to the internal policies and procedures of the microbiology lab-oratory at King Fahd Hospital of the University. CSF analysis revealed a white blood cell count of 1430/cu mm， with 82%segmented cells， a protein value of 316 mg/dL， and a glucose level of 3.0 mg/dL Direct Gram stain smears from samples showed few pus cells and no organisms. After 48 h of incu-bation， there was growth of nonhemolytic， translucent， pin-point colonies on anaerobic blood agar only . Gram stain smears from colonies showed no evidence of bacteria. The isolate was identified as M. hominis using MALDI-TOF-MS (VITEK MS； bioMerieux) and Knowledge Base database， with a confidence value of 99.9. Subsequent CSF samples also grew colonies of M. hominis. Table 1 summarizes CSF laboratory results for the patient during admission.\n\n【42】Discussion\n\n【43】M. hominis primarily colonizes the respiratory tract and genito-urinary tract. This organism is mainly transmitted to humans\n\n【44】Table 1.

Most infections caused by M. hominis are primarily related to genital tract colonization.\n\n【49】The infections caused by this organism include acute pyelone-phritis， cervicitis， endometritis， tubal factor infertility， postabor-tion bacteremia， bacterial vaginosis， and other genital tract infec-tions. Other reportable clinical conditions caused by M. hominis include bacteremia after renal transplantation， trauma， and geni-tourinary manipulations； osteomyelitis； septic arthritis； aspiration\n\n【50】Table 2.

Potential causes of iron deficiency anemia are prolonged breastfeeding with poor quality of introduced solid food and the use of whole cow milk instead of iron-rich formula. We describe 2 unusual cases of nutritional iron defi-ciency anemia with profound low level of hemoglobin around 1 g/dl， with similar diagnosis and different hos-pital course.\n\n【25】Case Reports：\n\n【26】First case： A 20-month-old Saudi boy presented with symptoms of acute gastroenteritis. He was noted to be very pale， with extremely low hemoglobin value of 1.1 g/dl. His nutritional status mostly consists of breast-feeding， with pooriron-rich food. He was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit with a complicated hos-pital course of reversible cardiomyopathy and gut involvement.\n\n【27】Second case： A 26-month-old Saudi girl presented with complaints of severe pallor and fatigability for 2 months， with critical result of extreme low level of hemoglobin 1.2 g/dl. A detailed nutritional history revealed being ex-clusively on pasteurized cow’s milk with no solid food intake for 6 months.\n\n【28】Conclusions：\n\n【29】Neglected cases of nutritional iron deficiency anemia may lead to profoundly low levels of hemoglobin. Possible manifestations include heart failure and gastrointestinal involvement in the form of leaky gut syndrome or ex-udative enteropathy. lV iron therapy was a very effective treatment in both patients. To our knowledge， prob-ably no reported cases of severe iron deficiency anemia reaching this extremely low level of hemoglobin with multiple associated complications exist in the pediatric literature.\n\n【30】Keywords： Anemia ·Iron Deficiency Anemia· Nutritional Anemia ·Iron-Refractory Iron Deficiency Anemia\n\n【31】Abbreviations：\n\n【32】PICU - Pediatric Intensive Care Unit；IDA -iron deficiency anemia； IRIDA-iron refractory iron defi-ciency anemia； G6PD-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency； ASD - strial septal defect； TACO -transfusion-associated circulatory overload； PRBC - packed red blood cells； PLE-protein-losing enteropathy\n\n【33】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/936252\n\n【34】Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the most widespread， pre-ventable， and treatable cause of microcytic anemia in chil-dren 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

Also， red blood cell distribution width index can be used as a sensitive diagnos-tic parameter to distinguish iron deficiency anemia from oth-er types of microcytic anemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【35】We describe 2 unusual cases of severe IDA with profound low levels of hemoglobin around 1g/dl， with a similar diagnosis but with a different hospital course. To our knowledge， prob-ably no reported cases of severe IDA reaching this extreme-ly low level of hemoglobin with multiple associated complica-tions exist in the pediatric literature.\n\n【36】Case Reports\n\n【37】The First Case\n\n【38】A previously healthy 20-month-old Saudi boy originally from Jeddah presented to our emergency department with a histo-ry of fever， vomiting，diarrhea， and decreased oral intake for 2days. He also has a history of choking while feeding. The pa-tient was managed as a case of acute gastroenteritis. On ex-amination， he looked visibly pale， but this was not the reason why the parents brought him to the hospital. Initial laborato-ry results showed an extremely critical low hemoglobin val-ue of 1.1g/dl.\n\n【39】Detailed history revealed that he is a full-term baby deliv-ered by a normal vaginal delivery with normal birth weight， and no perinatal or postnatal complications. He was on both bottle and breastfeeding until 6 months of age. At the time\n\n【40】of introducing solid food， the formula milk was stopped while breastfeeding was kept. Since then， he has been a picky eater.\n\n【41】At 20 months of age， he was still breastfeeding， with his diet consists mostly of food in the form of carbohydrate (plain rice and pasta) and some limited selection of vegetables (potato and carrot)， with minimal iron-rich food or green leaves. In ad-dition， the parents confirmed that he did not eat any meat-based foods at all. Aside from that， he was a quiet child with limited activity and easy fatigability while playing around the house， noticed by the parents around 6 months prior to pre-sentation. The family did not seek any medical advice re-garding this problem. In association with his inadequate diet， his weight was documented to be 9.3 kg and length was 82cm， putting him below the 5th percentile lines for length and weight for his age.\n\n【42】He had no history of previous admissions or chronic illness-es， and he was appropriately developed for his age and com-pleted all his vaccinations according to the Saudi vaccination schedule. He had no known allergies to food or medications and no history of any herbal product， medication， or any sup-plementation usage. At his 18-month vaccination， the parents were advised by the general practitioner to seek medical ad-vice as the child was noted to be pale but unfortunately the parents neglected those recommendations. The family histo-ry showed negative consanguinity between the parents， with positive history of sickle cell trait and IDA in the mother； she required Ⅳ iron therapy during all her pregnancies. He was the youngest of 3 siblings； all siblings were healthy accord-ing to the parents.\n\n【43】On examination， the patient appeared tired and dehydrated with cracked lips and sunken eyes. The patient looked visi-bly pale and bloodless including the palms and soles， he did not appear jaundiced， and no dysmorphic futures were no ticed. The baby was tachycardiac with a heart rate of 110/min. Auscultation revealed ejection systolic murmur at the apex area grade 2/6. Chest examination showed equal bilat-eral air entry， with right upper lung crackles. No retraction or signs of respiratory distress were noticed， and oxygen satura-tion was maintained in room air. Abdominal examination did not show any signs of hepatosplenomegaly， and the rest of examination resu lts were unremarkable.\n\n【44】The initial blood work-up revealed abnormal findings . The blood smear showed severe microcytic hypochromic ane-mia， anisocytosis， and few elliptocytosis， tear drop-like cells， and fragmented red blood cells， and no blast cells were seen. Hemoglobin electrophoresis was done and showed a picture of sickle cell trait. Screening for Glucose-6-phosphate dehy-drogenase deficiency (G6PD) was normal.\n\n|  | First case  | Second case  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Exam. name  | Initial value  | Initial value  |\n| WBC  | 14.98×10儿  | 13.16×10/  |\n| RBC  | 1.17×1012/L  | 0.84×1012/L  |\n| HGB  | 1.1 g/dL  | 1.2 g/dL  |\n| HCT  | 5.6%  | 4.3%  |\n| MCV  | 47.9 fl  | 51.20 fl  |\n| MCH  | 9.4 pg  | 14.30 pg  |\n| MCHC  | 19.6 g/dL  | 27.90 g/dL  |\n| RDW  | 27.1%  | 93.50%  |\n| MPV  | 9fl  | 12.80 fl  |\n| PLT  | 388×10/L  | 1402.00×10°/L  |\n| Reticulocytes  | 2.5%  | 0.31%  |\n| Ferritin  | 2.28 ng/mL  | 1.78 ng/mL  |\n| 25 hydroxy vitamin D  | 7.44 ng/mL  | 1974 ng/mL  |\n| Bilirubin total  | 4.40 umol/L  | 4.00 umol/L  |\n| Albumin  | 28.60 g/L  | 32.60 g/L  |\n\n【46】Other significant laboratory tests：\n\n【47】·25 hydroxy vitamin D： 7.44 nmol/l；\n\n【48】·Tissue transglutaminase antibodies： Negative；\n\n【49】·P&C Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody： Negative；\n\n【50】· Stool Calprotectin： Elevated；\n\n【51】·Alpha 1 antitrypsin： Elevated.\n\n【52】A chest X-ray was performed， and it showed consolidation in the right upper lobe， with increase cardiothoracic ratio， and clear cardiomegaly .\n\n【53】The patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit(PICU) as a case of chronic symptomatic microcytic hypochro-mic anemia with critical low hemoglobin level associated with aspiration pneumonia. The appropriate antibiotic was start-ed， and blood transfusion was requested. Two sets of aliquot packed red blood cells (PRBC) 5 ml/kg were ordered， and each set was given over 4 hours. The first cycle went with no compli-cations elevating the hemoglobin level from 1.1 g/d. to 3.5 g/dl. During the mid-transfusion of the second PRBC， the patient started to develop signs of respiratory distress， tachycardia， tachypnea with grunting， flaring of ala nasi， and increased ir-ritability. He was supported by oxygen therapy and eventual-ly the patient was electively intubated and connected to me-chanical ventilation anticipating worsening of the condition. As a result of that， the problem list was widened to include severe anemia for investigation， aspiration pneumonia， and pulmonary edema secondary to PRBC associated circulatory\n\n【54】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

From the cardiology side， echocardiography showed a3-mm atrial septal defect (ASD) with left >right shunt， dilat-ed left ventricle 41 mm with moderate mitral regurgitation， and ejection fraction of 50%. There was no recommendation to start the patient on Captopril or Lasix.\n\n【57】Gastroenterology evaluation conducted multiple differential diagnoses， especially with the presence of hypoalbuminemia. Protein-losing enteropathy，malabsorption， celiac disease， and nutritional etiology were all suspected. The patient underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy， which was normal.Follow-up biopsies were all nonspecific.\n\n【58】After stabilizing the patient on the second day， the third and last cycle of blood transfusion of small aliquot 3 ml/kg over4 hours was started with a target to increase hemoglobin to\n\n【59】a level between 6-7 g/dL. The patient was extubated after 3days of intubation after the resolution of the respiratory dis-tress. During the admission， he received 3 doses of I iron su-crose treatment. The dietitian team was heavily involved in the instruction of dietary guidelines for the child’s age， food preference， and the alternatives.\n\n【60】The patient stayed in the hospital for a total of 8 days and was discharged after that in a good condition. He was discharged on multivitamins， ferric hydroxide， and Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3). From the cardiology side， the patient was discharged on Furosemide and Captopril， which were discontinued in the clin-ic after 2 weeks. Based on the laboratory investigations and history， a diagnosis of severe nutritional IDA was made. The parents were educated about the child's situation and prop-er diet， along with the importance of screening for the par-ents and other siblings.\n\n【61】After 6 weeks from discharge， the patient came for a routine follow-up visit to the outpatient hematology clinic with a com-plaint of on-off periorbital swelling for 5 days， with a notice-able pallor for one week. Hypoalbuminemia was confirmed with low results of (albumin 14.9 g/d and protein 28.2 g/d)， without evidence of protein in the urine. During admission， his hemoglobin dropped from 7.1 g/dl to 6.1 g/dl， with a re-ticulocyte of 5.11%， and he required blood transfusion once. Vitamin B12 was ordered， showing a low level of 100 pg/ml. He was managed with albumin injection for 4 days， along-side 3 doses of lV iron sucrose therapy. Cyanocobalamin in-tra-muscular injection was given for 7 days for the treatment of Vitamin B12 deficiency. Both stool Calprotectin and Alpha1 antitrypsin showed high readings and further investigations were ordered to rule out inflammatory processes that could lead to protein-losing enteropathy. The repeated upper gas-trointestinal endoscopy with colonoscopy revealed a picture of duodenitis and inflammatory duodenal polyps， with no ev-idence of autoimmune enteropathy and a normal colonosco-py. Upon discharge， his albumin and protein were normalized and he was given a close follow-up in the clinic.\n\n【62】Furthermore， during his follow-up in the outpatient clinic 10days after discharge， he was readmitted with the same com-plaint of periorbital edema. Laboratory investigations showed(protein 25.70 g/dl， albumin 16.20 g/dl). He was admitted for1 day as a case of symptomatic hypoalbuminemia for albumin infusion with a stable hemoglobin level of 12.1 g/dl. Because of the persistent hypoalbuminemia， the pediatric gastroen-terologist advised giving a short course of steroid therapy for2 weeks duration to stop the ongoing inflammatory process.\n\n【63】One month later， after the short course of steroid， albumin and protein were normalized. However， he continued to have a drop in his hemoglobin； the possibility of iron-refractory\n\n【64】iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA) was raised， and the gene test(TMPRSS6) study was requested. The patient has been kept on close follow-up in the clinic for around 10 months. However， despite the treatment with multiple l iron therapy， his he-moglobin showed slow and partial response to the treatment， ranging between 6 and 8 g/dl.\n\n【65】Eventually， after missed follow-up by the parents and delay gene sequencing by the insurance company， the fina. gene result came back as： no large deletion or duplication within or encompass-ing the TMPRSS6 gene was identified by the qPCR， but deletion or duplication falling outside our amplicons cannot be exclud-ed， and only 13 out of 18 exons were sequenced. Along with a normal gene sequence， copper and zinc were normal. Our next step of management was for screening and sequencing all 18exons， and to continue with the I iron therapy for maintaining hemoglobin level， and to avoid unnecessary blood transfusion.\n\n【66】The Second Case\n\n【67】A 6-month-old Saudi girl， not known to have any medical ill-ness， presented to our emergency department with a com-plaint of pallor and fatigability for the last 2 months， with crit-ical result of extreme low hemoglobin of 1.2 g/dl. A detailed nutritional history revealed that in the last 3 months she was consuming pasteurized cow's milk only with no solid food in-take. Her growth parameters were： weight was 10.95 kg be-tween 5th and 10h percentile， and her height was 89 cm be-tween 50h to 75th percentiles for her age. On examination，she was afebrile at 37.5℃， and hemodynamically stable. She was clearly pale without any dysmorphic features and unremark-able systemic examination.\n\n【68】Laboratory investigations showed revealed abnormal findings. Severe microcytic hypochromic anemia with no retic-ulocytosis (0.31%)， a very low ferritin level (1.78 ng/ml)，nor-mal white blood cell count (WBC)， and thrombocytosis were all reported. Vitamin B12 was also ordered， showing a nor-mal level of 1974 pg/ml. Sickle cell test and G6PD screen were normal. She was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit for close monitoring and management. She received multiple blood transfusions until the hemoglobin level reached 6.8 g/dl. IV iron therapy was started for 2 days and then she was shift-ed to oral treatment. She was discharged in a good condition， with a hemoglobin level of 7.4 g/dl and a follow-up appoint-ment was made.\n\n【69】Discussion\n\n【70】We reported these 2 unusual pediatric cases of severe IDA with extremely low hemoglobin levels around 1 g/dl to highlight the differences between them， as the first case had a complicated\n\n【71】hospital course and a challenging diagnosis， whereas the sec-ond case had a smooth hospital course and a clear diagnosis.\n\n【72】The mechanism of iron absorption appears to be different in younger infants than in older ones. The liver produces hepci-din， which is the body's major regulator of iron metabolism， controlling iron absorption and excretion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Hepcidin produc-tion is reduced in cases of anemia and hypoxia yet increases in cases of inflammation and iron overload. It is yet unknown how much developmental differences in hepcidin expression influence iron absorption mechanisms in children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【73】Because chronic long-term anemia can be compensated by time， children can survive and tolerate extremely low levels of hemoglobin， such as those reported in our cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The decision to treat with blood transfusion or l iron therapy were not up for debate with these extremely low hemogio-bin levels， and the choice of blood transfusion was justified. Protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) is one of the manifestations of severe IDA， which our patient had. PLE can be attributed to an inflammatory process， non-inflammatory in case of celiac disease， or due to increased gastrointestinal lymphatic loses. However， few PLE cases have been reported to be non-hema-tological manifestations of severe IDA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Some cases of PLE with occult fecal blood loss in the context of IDA have been reported in the literature. These patients， on the other hand， had no evidence of any erosive or inflammatory activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【74】Cases of persistent anemia that is partially or totally refractory to oral iron therapy should alert clinicians to alternative， less common， and occasionally unusual causes of anemia. Iron re-fractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA)， an autosomal reces sive disorder caused by mutations in the TMPRSS6 gene， is one of the lesser-known causes. Microcytic hypochromic ane-mia， low transferrin saturation， and normal/high blood hepci-din levels are all symptoms of IRIDA. IRIDA is resistant to oral iron treatment but responds slowly to lV iron infusions， result-ing in partial anemia repair 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.

Nephropathy is a common compli-cation of diabetes mellitus and a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Micro-albuminuria is the earliest sign of renal involvement in patients with type 2 DM. Hypertension is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular events， a common cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. Objective： To determine the association between microalbuminuria and hypertension in type 2 diabetic patients attending the clinic at Benue State University Teaching Hospital (BSUTH)， Makurdi， Nigeria Methods： Ninety-three type 2 diabetic patients attending the diabetic clinic at Benue State University Teaching Hospital， Makurdi were screened for microalbuminuria and elevated blood pressure. Results： Sixty (64.5%) patients had normoalbuminuria， and thirty-three (35.5%) had microalbuminuria. The result also revealed a higher blood pressure in patients with microalbuminuria. Conclusion： The study revealed a higher prevalence of hypertension among patients with micro-albuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients， therefore emphasizing the need for early detection and treatment of microalbuminuria which wil halt or delay progression to end-stage renal disease and improve outcome in the management of diabetic patients.\n\n【5】KEYWORDS Microalbuminuria， Hypertension， Type 2 Diabetes mellitus\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Diabetes mellituss andhypertension are common non-communicable diseases with high morbidity and mortality.

It is hoped that screening for an early marker of renal damage and achieving blood pressure control can help prevent severe renal involvement in diabetic patients15. The study aims to see the association between microalbuminuria and hypertension in Type 2 diabetic patients seen at Benue State University Teaching Hospital， Makurdi， Nigeria.\n\n【21】Methods\n\n【22】A total of ninety-three diabetic patients attending diabetic clinic at Benue State University Teaching Hospital， Makurdi were re-cruited for the study. Exclusion criteria included the proven cause of secondary hypertension， patients with urinary tract in-fection， pregnant women， patients with established renal disease， overt proteinuria， acute febrile illness， use of NSAIDs.\n\n【23】The study was conducted over a period of nine months. Pa-tients age ranged from 18 - 70 years. Informed consent was obtained from each patient. Ethical approval was obtained from the institution human ethics and research committee.\n\n【24】The study participants were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Data obtained included age， gender， family his-tory of DM， weight； height and blood pressure were measured using standard methods. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg)/height (M)2.\n\n【25】Elevated blood pressure was defined as systaltic blood pres-sure (SBP) ≥140mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP)≥ 90mmHg or use of anti-hypertensive medications. Blood samples were obtained for fasting blood glucose. Morning mid-stream urine sample was used to calculate micro-albuminuria creatinine ratio in mg/g. Normoalbuminuria was defined as albuminuria creature ratio albumin creatinine ratio (ACR)<30mg/g. Microalbuminuria was defined as ACR between 30-300mg/g.Macroalbuminuria was defined as ACR ≥300mg/g. Samples positive for microalbuminuria were repeated within three months to confirm microalbuminuria.\n\n【26】Statistical analysis\n\n【27】The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Inc. Chicago II) version 21.0 statistical software was used for data analysis. The quantitative variable was expressed as means ± standard devia-tion while categorical variables were expressed as proportions. The t-test and the chi-square test were used in the comparison of means and proportions， respectively. P-value <0.05 was con-sidered statistically significant.\n\n【28】Results\n\n【29】Sixty patients had normoalbuminuria that is ACR≤30mg/g of these with normoalbuminuria， and there were 22 males and38 females while among those with microalbuminuria ACR ≥30mg/g there were 27 males and 16 females. The mean age was 53.12±11.66 in years. The characteristics of the study pop-ulation are shown in Table 1. Twenty-six (43.3%) of patients\n\n【30】with normoalbuminuria had a family history of DM compared with 18 (54.5%) Of patients with microalbuminuria. The result， however， was not statistically significant. Seventeen (28.3%) of patients with normoalbuminuria had a fasting blood glucose 之7.0 mmol/1 compared with 26 (78.8%) of those with microalbu-minuria. The result was statistically significant. Eight (13.3%) of patients with normoalbuminuria had been diabetic for over ten years compared with 19 (57.5%) of patients with microalbumin-uria. The result was statistically significant. The mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure of patients with normoalbuminuria was 131.7 mmHg and 97.6 mmHg respectively compared with148.5mmHg and 110.0 mmHg of patients with microalbumin-uria. The result was statistically significant. The comparison of blood pressure between patients with normoalbuminuria and microalbuminuria is shown in Table 2.\n\n【31】Discussion\n\n【32】Diabetes mellitus is a common metabolic disorder. It is also a leading cause of morbidity and mortality通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Cardiovascular disease is a common complication and largely accounts for the morbidity and mortality seen in diabetic patients. Microvascular complication such as nephropathy is a great contributor to the general disease burden通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【33】Microalbuminuria is an early marker of diabetic nephropa-thy and an independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease. It signifies generalized vascular dysfunction通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The incidence of end state renal disease has increased due to the increased preva-lence of diabetes mellitus通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. The presence of microalbumin in urine in diabetic patients is an early signal heralding the onset of systemic vasculopathy and other micro-vascular complication of diabetic's mellitus， including neuropathy， retinopathy and nephropathy通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【34】The prevalence of microalbuminuria from our study was33(35.5%)， and hypertension was found to be significantly associ-ated with microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetics. From our study，26(78.8%) of patients with microalbuminuria were hypertensive compared with 20 (33.3%) of those with normoalbuminuria. Sev-eral studies revealed similar findings. For instance， Svensson Maria et al20 from a nationwide population-based diabetes inci-dence study in Sweden reported a correlation between microal-buminuria and hypertension. Similarly， a cross-sectional study was done at Yazd diabetes research centre India， also revealed a significant association between hypertension and microalbu-minuria21. Additionally， Varghese A et al. in their study on the prevalence of microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients in a diabetic centre in Southern India reported a significant associa-tion between microalbuminuria and hypertension通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.\n\n【35】Also， a landmark prospective observational study on the association of systolic blood pressure and microvascular compli-cations of type 2 diabetes revealed a significant association be-tween elevated blood pressure and microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes including nephropathy and albuminuria通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>.\n\n【36】Microalbuminuria is present in 20-30% of patients with type2 DM and is especially common in those with hypertension， endothelial dysfunction and other features of insulin resistance. Microalbuminuria reflects generalised abnormality of vascu-lar function， an early sign of nephropathy and an indepen-dent predictor of end-stage renal disease and cardiovascular events24，25\\].\n\n【37】Hypertension and diabetes mellitus are risk factors for car-diovascular disease. The association of hypertension and albu-minuria is well established.

If hypertension occurs in association with diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy， mortality rises to 37fold above that of a healthy population通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【43】The combination of hypertension and diabetes significantly increases the risk of macrovascular and microvascular compli-cation of diabetes and an increase in morbidity and mortality arising from diabetes通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【44】Our study found a significant relationship between hyper-tension and microalbuminuria and this finding is associated with poor glycaemic control and duration of diabetes. Thus identifying and monitoring patients with micro-albuminuria is important because its treatment can prevent or delay overt nephropathy\\[26，271. Higher values of systolic and diastolic blood pressure in microalbuminuric than in normoalbuminuric patients suggests that hypertension is associated with microal-buminuria28\\].\n\n【45】Prom all the findings above， it can be included that screening for microalbuminuria should be done regularly so that early intervention like therapy and tight control of blood sugar and blood pressure can prevent or delay further complications of type 2 DM.\n\n【46】Conclusion\n\n【47】High prevalence of microalbuminuria in diabetic patients and its positive association with blood pressure suggests that screening for microalbuminuria is crucial to allow early intervention and prevention of further complications of diabetes like end-stage re-nal disease and cardiovascular disease. It is much more effective to screen diabetics to detect microalbuminuria which is a sign of early nephropathy and halt or delay progression by vigorous control of hypertension and hyperglycaemia than to manage overt nephropathy， renal failure and end-stage renal disease.\n\n【48】Disclosure Statement\n\n【49】There were no financial support or relationships between the authors and any organization or professional bodies that could pose conflict of interests.\n\n【50】Competing Interests\n\n【51】Written informed consent has been obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>References</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

It is often dif-ficult to differentiate from non-epithelial malignant tumors， and immunohistochemical staining may be need-ed to diagnose the condition. The mainstay of treatment is usually surgical with curative or palliative intent， since radio- and chemotherapy do not really improve the outcome. The average survival rate after surgery is34.5 months. At the time of diagnosis， 40-80% of cases have local regional lymph node metastases.\n\n【17】Case Report： The case of a 67-year-old male patient with PMME is reported. He presented with progressive dysphagia. A computerized tomography was performed in which a polypoid mass was observed in the distal esophagus. It was originally suspected to be an adenocarcinoma， but was subsequently correctly diagnosed by immunohis-tochemical staining with HMB-45 antibody and by the presence of S-100 protein. A subtotal esophagectomy was performed.\n\n【18】Conclusions：\n\n【19】Very few cases of PMME have been reported in the literature and there is only limited clinical experience with this disease. Therefore， it is very difficult to establish clear criteria for clinical recognition of this type of mela-noma. Early histopathological confirmation of the character is essential for further treatment in case of confir-mation of malignancy.\n\n【20】MeSH Keywords： Esophageal Neoplasms· Esophagectomy·Immunohistochemistry· Melanoma · Prognosis ·Tomography， Spiral Computed\n\n【21】Full-text PDF http：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/894041\n\n【22】Primary malignant melanoma of the esophagus (PMME) is a neoplasm that accounts for 0.1-0.2% of all primary neoplasms of the esophagus and 0.5% of visceral melanomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Baur described the first MPME in 1906 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> and it has since been de-scribed in 340 different reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【23】The MPME most often affects patients between the sixth and seventh decade of life. There is a 2.02：1 male predominance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【24】The most common clinical presentation is the onset of pro-gressive dysphagia， chest pain， dyspnea， and weight loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Endoscopy shows MPME as one or more pigmented polypoid le-sions， located in the middle and lower third of the esophagus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Traditionally， the use of Computed Tomography (CT) with contrast has been suggested for the study of exten-sion of PMME. However， recent studies recommend the 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET/CT to be used as a first-line modal-ity for staging this tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【26】The MPME is usually very aggressive， showing nodal metasta-ses at time of diagnosis in 40-80% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Due to its low frequency， MPME treatment is not standard-ized and it still remains a highly aggressive tumor. This case report presents a 67-year-old male with MPME originally sus-pected to be an adenocarcinoma by CT， but subsequently cor-rectly diagnosed by HMB-45 and S-100 protein immunohis-tochemistry. It includes a short review of the literature. The patient underwent surgical treatment and， till now， he is still alive for 6 months without any chemotherapy， radiotherapy and immunomodulatory therapy.\n\n【28】Case Report\n\n【29】A 67 year old man presented with a two months history of dysphagia for solids. He denied vomit or constitutional syn-drome. A chest x-ray was done and was normal.\n\n【30】Subsequently， a Computed tomography (CT) of thorax revealed an intra-luminal mass of 35x20 mm in the lower of esophagus， which was well-defined. There was no apparent local invasion or mediastinal lymph nodes enlargement. It was originally sus-pected to be an esophageal adenocarcinoma .\n\n【31】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

(D) The neoplastic cells were positive for Melan-A(immunohistochemistry，×200).</u>\n\n【33】Given the findings， an endoscopy was performed. A peduncu-lated polypoid lesion of downy appearance was found 35 cm from the incisors. It was ulcerated and friable， occupying but not occluding the esophageal lumen.\n\n【34】An endoscopic biopsy of the lesion was performed. Samples were sent for pathology which revealed melanoma. No other findings of pathological significance were detected in the re-mainder of the study.\n\n【35】A positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) was performed， being detected a hypermetabolism in the distal third of the esophagus (SUV 11.7). The rest of the ex-amination did not show any evidence of other hypermeta-bolic lesions suggestive of a metastatic spread of the tumor.\n\n【36】With a preoperative staging IB (T2 NO M0)， a subtotal esopha-gectomy with double approach by laparoscopy and thoracosco-py and an Ivor Lewis intrathoracic anastomosis were performed.\n\n【37】Intraoperative findings were an exophytic polypoid tumor in the distal esophageal third， which did not invade the adventi-tia and apparently did not affect the muscle itself. It was also observed pigmented para-esophageal and subcarinal lymph-adenopathies. These were excised and sent with the resect-ed specimen of the esophagus to the pathology department to be examined.\n\n【38】The macroscopic examination of the surgical specimen showed a pigmented black， polypoid lesion measuring 4.3×2.4×2 cm.\n\n【39】The microscopic examination also showed that the tumor was composed of polygonal and spindle-shaped cells in a sheet-like growth pattern with minimal inflammation and stromal re-action . Furthermore it showed some melanin pigment cells. Radial growth was seen in mucosa surrounding the tumor . The tumor cells were stained positive with S100， Melan-A and HMB45 . A metastasis was\n\n【40】seen in one regional lymph node. The diagnosis was a prima-ry malignant melanoma of the esophagus.\n\n【41】The patient had a good clinical outcome after surgery and was discharged home 14 days after surgery. He has subsequent-ly undergone a CT and a PET-CT scans and remains disease free for over 6 months.\n\n【42】Discussion\n\n【43】The PMME is an extremely rare neoplasm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> that manifests itself in most cases as a progressive dysphagia， just as it did in our case 4l.\n\n【44】Currently， the diagnostic sequence is still not properly estab-lished although a CT with intravenous contrast is an option for an extension study. Our patient showed a nonspecific CT pre-sentation of the primary lesion， as well as other authors have reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，6\\]</u>. Therefore， the histological confirmation is always necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis of melanoma as Sahoo et al. suggested 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Other forms of useful images are MRl and CT-enterography， and most importantly， the PET-CT通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【45】Sanchez et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> found that primary malignant melanoma of the esophagus occurred mostly (>90%) in the mid and lower third of esophagus.\n\n【46】The differential diagnosis includes spindle cell carcinoma，leio-myosarcoma and Kaposi's sarcoma. It is difficult to differen-tiate these MPME esophageal tumors based on radiological criteria but there are some manifestations that may be more suggestive of some of them \\[7J. For example， in the esophago-gram， the spindle cell carcinoma is seen as a large intraluminal lobed mass that expands the light without causing obstruc-tion. In the CT， the leiomyosarcoma shows as a heterogeneous exophytic mass with areas of necrosis， while Kaposi's sarcoma shows as multiple submucosal masses or polypoid lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【47】Other malignancies such as adenocarcinoma of the esopha-gus or the squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus also may rarely manifest as a polypoid mass. In these neoplasms it is more common to see an eccentric or circumferential wall thickening greater than 5 mm.\n\n【48】References：\n\n【49】1\\.

This case report pres-ents a patient with PMME by positive results for HMB-45 and S100 protein， treated by surgical resection without chemo-therapy. Six months after surgery， the patient is alive without tumor recurrence. The diagnosis of PMME should combine clinical symptoms， auxiliary examination， pathological exam-ination， and immunohistochemistry. We propose that the ef-fectiveness of diagnostic guidelines or treatment will rise with an increase in the number of PMME case reports.\n\n【56】Statement\n\n【57】We received no financial support for this study.

Extragonadal choriocarcinomas are notoriously challenging to diagnose， and have often progressed to advanced disease by the time of diagnosis. The survival rate for ex-tragonadal choriocarcinoma is approximately 30%， which is much lower than that of extragonadal non-semi-nomatous germ cell tumors (GCT) in general.\n\n【19】Case Report：\n\n【20】A 24-year-old man with no significant past medical history presented with left-sided， pleuritic chest pain and back pain radiating down his left leg， of 1-year duration. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed mul-tiple bilateral pulmonary nodules and a CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed a large heterogeneous soft tis-sue mass measuring 9.3x8×10.5 cm. A CT-guided core needle biopsy of a lung nodule was performed and the findings were consistent with the diagnosis of metastatic choriocarcinoma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was negative for metastatic disease. Tumor markers were significant for a markedly elevated beta human chorionic gonadotropin (B-hCG) of 104 712 mlU/mL. He was diagnosed with a stage IlIC germ cell tu-mor， further classified as a primary retroperitoneal choriocarcinoma with lung metastasis， and was started on urgent inpatient chemotherapy\n\n【21】Conclusions：\n\n【22】Due to the poor outcomes associated with extragonadal choriocarcinoma， it is important to promptly and cor-rectly identify this malignancy in order to initiate treatment in a timely manner. The following case report ex-plores the histopathologic characterization of this malignancy and describes the clinical course and outcomes from treatment for this patient.\n\n【23】Keywords： Choriocarcinoma， Non-Gestational·Neoplasm Metastasis ·Neoplasms， Germ Cell and Embryonal\n\n【24】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/936288\n\n【25】￥ 口 1 6 87 山：6 目可15\n\n【26】l Department of Internal Medicine， Orlando Regional Healthcare， Orlando， FL， USA2 Department of Pathology Orlando Regional Healthcare， Orlando， FL， USA3 Division of Academic Affairs and Research， Orlando Regional Healthcare， Orlando FL，USA\n\n【27】Germ cell tumors (GCT) account for 95% of testicular cancers and most commonly affect adolescent and young adult males ages 15-39 years old. Choriocarcinoma is a rare malignant GCT most commonly seen in females and represents less than 5%of all GCTs in males 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In male patients， germ cell tumors mainly present in the testes， however， but they occasional-ly present primarily in an extragonadal location， most com-monly in midline regions such as the anterior mediastinum， retroperitoneum， or pineal gland 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Extragonadal choriocar-cinoma in males is especially rare， with an incidence rate of approximately 0.022 per 100， 000 people 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The pathogene-sis of extragonadal choriocarcinoma is poorly understood and an accurate diagnosis is critical for correct management. The diagnosis requires imaging and histology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Extragonadal choriocarcinoma in an adult male typically yields a poor prognosis， with a 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of around 30% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>， which is significantly lower compared to ret-roperitoneal nonseminomas in general， which have an asso-ciated 62% 5-year OS rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Extragonadal choriocarcinoma in a male is an aggressive malignancy， and first-line therapy includes multiagent chemotherapy followed by surgical resec-tion of the residual tumor. As extragonadal choriocarcinoma is very rare in males and yields a poor prognosis， increased awareness of this tumor type in males can facilitate earlier diagnosis and treatment and thus improve survival rates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Here， we present a case of an otherwise healthy 24-year-old man who was diagnosed with a high-risk primary retroperi-toneal choriocarcinoma with metastatic disease to the lungs.\n\n【29】Case Report\n\n【30】A 24-year-old man with no significant past medical history pre-sented with a chief concern of left-sided， pleuritic chest pain and back pain radiating down his left leg. The pain started approximately onel year prior to admission， but progressive-ly worsened over the past few weeks， prompting the patient to seek medical attention at an urgent care facility. A recent\n\n【31】chest radiograph and radiograph of the lumbar spine were re-ported as normal and the patient was treated with pain med-ication. However， the pain failed to resolve and he returned to the emergency room 2 weeks later. The patient was a non-smoker and did not use alcohol or illicit drugs. Initial vital signs revealed mild tachypnea but were otherwise normal. On physical examination， there were scattered rhonchi noted on pulmonary auscultation bilaterally. His back was nontender to palpation. Pertinent laboratory results were： hemoglobin8.8 g/dL \\[normal 12.6-16.7 g/dL\\]， D-dimer 3155 ug/mL \\[nor-mal 0.27-0.49 ug/ml\\]， lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 409 U/L\\[normal 140-271 U/L\\]， and normal leukocyte count and dif-ferential. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest  revealed innumerable bilateral pulmonary nodules measur-ing up to 4.5 cm，concerning for pulmonary metastasis. CT of the abdomen and pelvis  showed a large heteroge-neous soft tissue mass measuring 9.3x8×10.5 cm that was compressing the bladder， consistent with a possible prima-ry neoplasm arising from the left iliopsoas muscle. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was negative for intra-cranial metastasis. A CT-guided core needle biopsy of a lung nodule was performed. Tumor markers were significant for a markedly elevated beta human chorionic gonadotropin (B-hCG) of 104 712 mlU/mL. Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) was normal. Subsequent physical examination of the testes was negative\n\n【32】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2.

Pathology revealed tumor cells that strongly and dif-fusely expressed CK AE1/3 (anti-cytokeratin monoclonal an-tibodies， AE1 and AE3) ， Cam 5.2 (Anti-Cytokeratin)， CK7 (Cytokeratin 7)， GATA-3， and HCG. The morphologic and immunophenotypic findings were consistent with the diagno-sis of metastatic choriocarcinoma . Oncology was consulted for evaluation of a high-risk， stage IlIC germ cell tu-mor， further classified as a primary retroperitoneal choriocar-cinoma with lung metastasis. A primary testicular tumor was excluded because of the examination and scrotal imaging. A primary retroperitoneal extragonadal choriocarcinoma and not a primary lung or mediastinal extragonadal choriocarcinoma was considered likely considering his clinical presentation and abdominal and retroperitoneal imaging. Due to the bulky na-ture of his disease， the patient was started on urgent inpa-tient chemotherapy with cisplatin， etoposide， and ifosfamide\n\n【36】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5.

His B-hCG decreased to 5 mlU/mL  and re-staging CT scans showed response to therapy with a decrease in the size of pulmonary nodules and a smaller but persistent left pelvic sidewall mass. The patient subsequently underwent retroperitoneal lymph node dissection with urolo-gy and pathology revealed no viable tumor cells. The patient is currently asymptomatic and will continue to follow up with Oncology and Urology as needed.\n\n【39】Discussion\n\n【40】Approximately 95% of male germ cell tumors originate in the testes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Germ cell tumors are categorized as either semi-nomatous or non-seminomatous. Non-seminomatous GCTs consist of embryonal tumors， yolk-sac tumors，teratomas， and choriocarcinomas. Choriocarcinomas are the rarest of the non-seminomas and are associated with the worst overall surviv-al rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. When there is no evidence of a primary testicular\n\n【41】tumor， GCTs are classified as extragonadal germ cell tumors(EGCT). When they do arise， EGCT tend to present along the midline， most commonly the anterior mediastinum， retroper-itoneum， and pineal gland. Presentation along midline struc-tures suggests a diagnosis of a primary EGCT rather than meta static disease from a primary testicular tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. As of 2018，27 cases of retroperitoneal choriocarcinoma have been report-ed in the literature 3\\].\n\n【42】EGCTs share the same tumor markers and histological sub-types as their gonadal germ cell tumor counterparts. The se-rum tumor markers alpha fetoprotein (AFP)， human chorionic gonadotropin (B-hCG)， and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are measured in GCTs and are primarily used to monitor treat-ment response and detect disease recurrence. In particular. B-hCG is used to monitor treatment response and disease re-currence in patients with choriocarcinoma 9\\].The pathogen-esis of EGCT is not well defined， but 3 prominent hypotheses have been proposed to explain the origin： 1) the tumor may result from abnormal primordial germ cell migration during embryonal development； 2) the tumor might be a testicular choriocarcinoma metastasis with spontaneous regression of the primary testicular tumor； 3) the tumor may originate as a nontrophoblastic neoplasm that mutated into a choriocar-cinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，11\\]</u>. Non-seminomatous GCTs are highly invasive masses and radiographically appear inhomogeneous due to necrosis and hemorrhage within the tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Histologically， choriocarcinoma presents as solid sheets and clusters of syn-cytiotrophoblasts and cytotrophoblasts with occasional hem-orrhage and necrosis. Immunohistochemically， tumor cells express keratin and hCG. Our patient's tumor pathology was consistent with these findings. Differential diagnoses include other germ cell tumors such as seminoma with scattered syn-cytiotrophoblasts， non-small cell carcinoma of the lung， and embryonal carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【43】The definitive diagnosis of an extragonadal GCT requires both exclusion of metastatic disease from a primary tumor in the tes-tes and distinguishing an extragonadal GCT from another poor-ly differentiated cancer via biopsy and histopathological exam-ination. Retroperitoneal GCTs are typically bulky at the time of presentation because patients tend to seek medical attention only once the tumor is large enough to compress surrounding organs and cause symptoms. Clinical manifestations of EGCTs are often related to compression of surrounding structures due to a large tumor burden， including abdominal pain， back pain， lower-extremity edema， and obstructive uropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【44】Treatment of extragonadal choriocarcinoma consists of a cispl-atin-based chemotherapy followed by surgical resection of the residual mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Proper histological classification， anatomical location， tumor marker levels， and patient demographics are all important factors that determine prognosis and guide therapy\n\n【45】of EGCT. Risk factors that stratify patients into intermediate-and high-risk groups include mediastinal or retroperitoneal lo-cation， visceral metastases， and elevated tumor markers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In these groups， 4 cycles of chemotherapy are recommended， as opposed to the 3 cycles for lower-risk individuals. First-line therapy is a cisplatin-based regimen with either BEP (bleomy-cin， etoposide， and cisplatin) or VIP (etoposide， ifosfamide and cisplatin). BEP is the standard therapy， while VIP can be con-sidered in those with underlying pulmonary disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. For patients in the low-risk category， a reasonable but slightly less effective regimen with EP (etoposide and cisplatin) can be con-sidered to avoid the adverse effects of bleomycin.

According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines， both BEP and VIP are considered to be first-line therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. VIP was chosen over BEP as the preferred treatment regimen in our patient to avoid the pos-sibility of bleomycin-induced lung toxicity given the presence of pulmonary metastatic disease. After 4 cycles of VIP， our pa-tient showed a significant response as evidenced by a marked reduction in B-hCG levels from 104 712 mlU/mL to 5 mlU/mL. and decreased tumor burden on re-staging CT scans. Routine measurement of B-hCG levels and regular re-staging PET/CT scans (positron emission tomography) are essential for mon-itoring disease regression. Additionally， long-term follow-up of these patients may be required to more accurately mea-sure treatment response and monitor for disease recurrence.\n\n【47】Extragonadal choriocarcinoma is an extremely rare tumor that usually presents in young males. Extragonadal choriocarci-nomas are notoriously challenging to diagnose， and have of-ten progressed to advanced disease by the time of diagnosis. The survival rate for extragonadal choriocarcinoma is approx-imately 30%， which is much lower than that of other extrago-nadal non-seminomatous GCTs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，15\\]</u>. Although a diagnosis of extragonadal choriocarcinoma yields a poor prognosis and this tumor type typically responds poorly to chemoradiation， treatment can potentially be lifesaving. Our patient， in partic-ular， has experienced significant improvement in symptomatic disease and tumor burden after treatment with chemotherapy and post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection.\n\n【48】Conclusions\n\n【49】this malignancy in order to initiate treatment in a timely man-ner. However， given the rarity of extragonadal choriocarcino-ma， there are not many actively enrolling clinical trials avail-able to patients. Therefore， it is imperative to conduct more randomized clinical trials to better establish treatment guide lines and improve survival rates.\n\n【50】References：\n\n【51】1\\.

After performing the standard preoperative investigations， which confirmed the diagnosis， the patient underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We found a left-sided gallbladder， attached to the lower surface of the left lobe of the liver. During the dissection in the Callot triangle an aplastic cystic duct was also identified. The extirpa-tion of the gallbladder was performed anterograde， allowing a better exposition of the critical structures.\n\n【23】Conclusions：\n\n【24】A left sided gallbladder is almost an incidental finding， which can be accompanied with further anomalies of the biliary tree.

A co-existence of a left-sided gallbladder with an aplastic cys-tic duct has not been reported in the literature so far. Thus， we report a case of a female patient with an acute cholecys-titis， which was treated with a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The combination of aforementioned co-existent condition was intraoperatively identified.\n\n【28】Case Report\n\n【29】A 64-year-old female was referred to our emergency unit with a history of epigastric pain lasting 4 hours. Clinical examination revealed a tenderness in the right upper quadrant and epigas-trium with a positive Murphy's sign， without jaundice. The blood test showed elevated white blood cell counts (14.3/uL) with a CRP-elevation (24.18 mg/dL) and normal levels of liver en-zymes (SGOT 27 U/L， SGPT 57 U/L， bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL， alka-line phosphatase 83 U/mL). Her past medical history was un-remarkable. The ultrasound examination showeda 5mm gallbladder wall thickening with presence of multiple stones. Because of the profound pain， the obesity of the patient， and the luminal intestinal gas which limited the sonographic as-sessment of the other upper abdominal organs， we performed a computed tomography (CT) scan to exclude a secondary wall thickening of the gallbladder to sealed duodenal ulcer perfo-ration or right sided diverticulitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. The findings confirmed the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. The patient was admit-ted to our department to undergo a laparoscopic cholecystec-tomy on the same day.\n\n【30】At laparoscopy， the gallbladder was located on the left side of the falciform ligament， between liver segments Ill and ⅣV， without any signs of a situs inversus . We started the operation using 4 ports， 2 of 10 mm and 2 of 5 mm. The gall-bladder was tense and distended， making it difficult to grasp. That problem was managed by aspirating the content of the gallbladder with a needle using the 10 mm epigastric trocar. In order to attain a better exposition of the Callot triangle， we inserted an additional 10 mm trocar on the left side of the middle line between the subxiphoidal and umbilical trocar. The visceral peritoneum was highly incised on the gallblad-der and a structure similar to the cystic duct was identified. A junction of the gallbladder and the tubular structure was identified. Posterior to this structure another bile duct with the same diameter was found. Because of the unusual anatomic findings and to attain a better exposition we performed the gallbladder extirpation in an anterograde way. The gallblad-der was separated from the hepatic bed. Behind the Hartmann pouch，the junction between cystic artery and gallbladder was found. The area between the cystic artery and the Hartmann pouch was dissected， creating a window through which the liver was visible. The cystic artery was clipped and divided. Finally， at the end of the exploration we recognized that the 2initially identified bile ducts were a part of a loop-shaped com-mon bile duct and the gallbladder was drained direct into it， as a sign of absent cystic duct . In order to avert an injury to the common bile duct， we transected the Hartmann pouch 5 mm distal to its junction into the gallbladder with an endoscopic linear stapler 55 mm (blue cartridge). Because of the clear view of the Callot triangle structures， we did not per-form a cholangiogram.\n\n【31】The pathological report revealed an acute gangrenous cholecys-titis with an impacted stone in the Hartmann pouch. The post-operative period was uneventful， and the patient was dis-charged 2 days later.\n\n【32】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

The inci-dence， according to a study performed on fetal examinations， was 0.15% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. A left-sided gallbladder was detected only in6 cases out of 10 016 examinations. The reported prevalence in the literature ranges between 0.04% and 0.3%， with more than 100 cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-14\\]</u>. The left-sided gallbladder must be lo-cated to the left of the falciform ligament， beneath the left lobe of the liver and between segments Ill and IV or on seg-ment III通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The cystic artery should always cross in front of the common bile duct from right to left 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Additionally， the vena hepatica media must clearly run to the right of the gallbladder. These features differentiate a true left-sided gallbladder from the gallbladder located to the left of a right-sided round liga-ment. Figure 2 presents the position of the gallbladder to the right of the round ligament， Figure 3 presents the position to the right of the vena hepatica media， and Figure 4 presents\n\n【37】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4.

A retrospective assessment of the computerized tomography scans with the radiologists in our clinic did not reveal any other anomalies of the intrahepatic vascular or biliary tree. The sec-ond anatomical anomaly that was found in this case was the aplastic cystic duct， which can be either congenital or acquired. A congenitally absent cystic duct is a rare variety with only 11cases found in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. The cause of an acquired absence of the cystic duct is a severe fibrosis or an impacted gallstone in the cystic duct . We considered that in this case， the patient had a previous short bile duct (<5 mm)， which became secondarily aplastic after the impaction of the\n\n【40】gallstone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The normal common bile duct diameter and the normal levels of the liver enzymes preoperative allowed for a differentiation between the acquired aplastic cystic duct and a type l Mirizzi syndrome， caused by stones impacted in the infundibulum with compression of the common bile duct 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. The histological examination in our case showed an impacted gallstone in the Hartmann pouch， indicating that the anom-aly was acquired.\n\n【41】The common preoperative ultrasonography could not detect the left-sided gallbladder. We performed a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis of an acute cholecystitis， rather than detecting an anatomical anomaly. According to the CT scan the gallblad-der was localized beneath the left lobe of the liver. The pres-ence of the Vena hepatica media on the right side of the gall-bladder was retrospective confirmed with the CT scan.\n\n【42】To avert operative complications， the dissection in the Callot triangle must be performed carefully.

Although its clinical picture is well defined， its individual manifestations may vary greatly in their onset， time-course， and clinical symptoms， which makes the its diagnosis difficult.\n\n【9】Case Report：\n\n【10】A case of recurrent IgE-dependent anaphylaxis is reported which was induced by omeprazole with cross-sensitivity to other PPIs in a 67-year-old woman with coronary heart disease in whom the recur-rent anaphylactic symptoms were mistaken for episodes of stenocardial pain. The IgE-dependent mechanism of this reaction and the cross-reactivity with pantoprazole were documented by posi-tive intradermal tests with this drugs. Oral challenge with an H2 blocker， dictated by the postulat-ed cross-reactivity of PPIs and all imidazoles， was performed. The result of an oral challenge with ranitidine was negative.\n\n【11】Conclusions：\n\n【12】Proton pump inhibitors， commonly regarded as safe， can cause severe anaphylaxis. The diagnosis of anaphylaxis in elderly patients is difficult because anaphylactic symptoms may imitate those of many coexisting disorders. Symptoms of drug-induced anaphylaxis can recur in reactions to the same factor， presenting a varied clinical picture and progressive intensity.\n\n【13】key words： omeprazole · anaphylaxis · proton pump inhibitors\n\n【14】Full-text PDF： http：//www.amjcaserep.com/fulltxt.php?ICD=878550\n\n【15】Word count：\n\n【16】2370\n\n【17】Tables： 1\n\n【18】Figures：\n\n【19】3\n\n【20】References： 15\n\n【21】Author's address： Marita Nittner-Marszalska， Department of Internal Medicine， Allergology， and Geriatrics， Wroctaw Medical\n\n【22】University Traugutta 57 Str.， 50-417 Wroclaw， Poland， e-mail marmarsz@uni.wroc.pl\n\n【23】Omeprazole was the first proton pump inhibitor (PPI)， in-troduced in 1989， to treat peptic ulcer disease. Functionally， PPIs are non-competitive inhibitors of H+K+-ATPase， a pra-ton pump which is the final stage of gastric acid secretion. PPIs inhibit both basic and stimulated gastric acid secre-tion by blocking hydrogen ion secretion and therefore re-duce acid production and increase gastric pH. Drugs of this class have been widely used in the treatment of peptic ulcer， gastritis， and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. They have proved to be essential in combination therapy for Helicobacter in-fections and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and are often used for gastric protection along with antiphlo-gistic drugs and aspirin. After omeprazole， five other PPIs， i.e. rabeprazole， esomeprazole， lansoprazole， dexlansopra-zole，and pantoprazole， have been introduced and are avail-able on the market in different countries. Each of them has a different pharmacokinetic profile， tissue selectivity， and characteristics of interaction with the cytochrome P450en-zyme system， but all are modified benzimidazoles with a pyr-idine ring， differing by virtue of substitutions on both rings. PPIs are structurally and pharmacologically related to other imidazoles， for example H，receptor block-ers， metronidazole，and ketoconazole.\n\n【24】PPIs are widely believed to be safe drugs， with an excellent therapeutic index and a low incidence of adverse reactions， especially allergic ones. Most of the allergic adverse reactions are limited to local reactions (gloss edema)， generalized ur-ticaria， and/or angioedema \\[l-5\\].

Finally， an anaphylactic reaction can be misinterpret-ed as symptoms of other illnesses the patient suffers from， for example cardiac syndromes， as shown in our patient.\n\n【25】Here we report a case of recurrent anaphylaxis due to hy-persensitivity to omeprazole with cross-sensitivity to other PPIs in a patient with coronary heart disease in whose case the recurrent anaphylactic symptoms were mistaken for ep-isodes of stenocardial pain.\n\n【26】CASE REPORT\n\n【27】A 67-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for an evaluation of anaphylaxis with the suspicion of omeprazole-induced anaphylaxis. She had a history of coronary heart disease and hypertension. She underwent a surgical proce-dure in the year 2000 (a coronary artery bypass graft， CABG) and was reoperated in 2001 (percutaneous transluminal an-gioplasty， PTCA， with Josten FlexMaster stent placement to the right coronary artery). For this reason the patient was under regular treatment with enalapril 20 mg b.i.d.， cloni-dine hydrochloride 0.075 mg b.i.d.， bisoprolol 1.25 mg u.i.d.， isosorbide mononitrate 50 mg u.i.d.， ASA 75 mg u.i.d.， and simvastatin 20 mg u.i.d. She had recurrent persistent heart-burn classified as “ulcer like”and thus used omeprazole 20\n\n【28】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.0meprazole.</u>\n\n【29】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2. Pantoprazole.</u>\n\n【30】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3.Rabeprazole.</u>\n\n【31】mg under medical recommendation as a symptomatic drug and gastric protection. She had had no significant past med-ical history of atopy drug allergy， or chronic medical condi-tions with the exception of those mentioned above. In the past few months she had had recurrent episodes of slight fa-cial edema， substantial chest discomfort， dyspnea，orthosta-sis， hypotension， and impaired consciousness. These symp-toms differed in intensity and duration and disappeared untreated. Because of the reported symptoms， the patient was examined by a general practitioner who associated these symptoms with coronary heart disease and recommended a cardiologic consultation. Soon the patient experienced an-other similar but more severe episode of angioedema ofthe face， substernal discomfort， dyspnea， hypotension， and loss of consciousness. Unlike in the previous cases， this time the patient was sure the symptoms were caused by omeprazole； she had ingested the drug 30-40 minutes earlier in a dose of 20 mg (Losec Astra Zeneca， Sweden). She was brought to an emergency department where she fully recovered af-ter a subcutaneous injection of adrenaline， intraven ous sa-line， and steroids (hydrocortisone).\n\n【32】Two months later she was admitted to our allergology de-partment. The patient was under treatment with clonidine hydrochloride 0.075 mg b.i.d.， bisoprolol 1.25 mg u.i.d.， Tena11isosorbide mononitrate 50 mg u.i.d.， enarenal 10 mg b.i.d， and simvastatin 20 mg u.i.d. Generally， the patient was sta-ble (blood pressure： 130/95 mmHg， HR：80/min). The bio-chemical tests did not reveal any abnormalities； the only ex-ception was dyslipidemia. A skin prick test with common aeroallergens showed negative results.\n\n| ICT  | Omeprazole  |  | Pantoprazole  |  | Esomeprazole  |  | Ranitidine  |  | Metronidazole  |  | Histamine Saline  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ICT  | 40 mg/ml  |  | 40 mg/ml  |  | 40 mg/ml  |  | 0.5mg/ml  |  | 5 mg/ml  |  | 1mg/ml PT  | 0.9% ICT  |\n| Dilution  | 1/1000  | 1/100  | 1/1000  | 1/100  | 1/1000  | 1/100  | 1/1000  | 1/100  | 1/1000  | 1/100  |  |  |\n| Result  | 十  | 十  | 十  | 十  | 一  | 一  | 一  | 一  | 一  | 一  | 十  | 一  |\n| Wheal  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| imean diameter  | 9  | 9  | 10  | 10  | 5  | 6  | 一  | 一  | 一  | 一  | 6.5  | 一  |\n| in mm)  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n【34】\\+ positive result’-negative result；ICT- intra cutaneous test； PT - prick test.\n\n【35】To our understanding， omeprazole was responsible not only for the occurrence of the anaphylactic shock symptoms， but also for the identical， though less severe， symptoms previ-ously experienced and misinterpreted as cardiac symptoms. Therefore， intracutaneous tests (ICTs) were performed us-ing commercial preparations of intravenous omeprazole(Losec 40 mg； Astra Zeneca) and two other PPIs which the patient had not used previously： pantoprazole (Controloc40 mg； Altana Pharma) and esomeprazole (Nexium， 40 mg； Astra Zeneca). An ICT with rabeprazole was not performed because the drug was available only as delayed-release en-teric-coated tablets， which made a safe and accurate dilu-tion for intradermal use impossible. Ampoules omeprazole， pantoprazole， and esomeprazole were diluted in saline to0.04 mg/m1，0.4mg/ml，and 4mg/ml each. ICTs were per-formed by injection of 0.02 ml of the tested drug solution； an injection of this amount of liquid intradermally raises a papula of 3 mm. An increase in diameter greater than 3mm is considered a positive response during the immedi-ate reading after 15 minutes. Saline solution and histamine were used as negative and positive controls， respectively. All the tested PPIs elicited positive results . A sim-ilar test performed on five unexposed healthy control sub-jects showed negative results. The results of the skin tests performed on our patient supported hypersensitivity to omeprazole as the cause of anaphylaxis. We did not choose to perform an oral challenge with omeprazole because we thought the risk was considerable given the increasing se-verity of her reactions.\n\n【36】To investigate the cross-reaction patterns with other imidaz-oles， skin tests were performed with metronidazole (metro-nidazole 5mg/ml； GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals) and an H2 receptor antagonist， ranitidine (Ranigast 0.5 mg/ml； Polpharma) that might replace PPIs in the future treatment of the patient. The ICTs were performed with 1/1000，1/100， and 1/10 solutions of metronidazole and ranitidine. The re-sults were negative. Knowing that the patient would need to continue taking a gastro-protective drug， an oral challenge test with ranitidine was performed (3 doses at 60-minute in-tervals，1/4，1/2，and1 tablet). The test result was negative.\n\n【37】Six months later the patient was invited to a follow-up visit. She did not have any complaints. She did not use any PPIs. The recommended ranitidine was tolerated very well. At the time of reevaluation the patient was taking the same drugs that had been prescribed at the time of her release from the\n\n【38】hospital (enarenal， ASA， bisoprolol， clonidine hydrochlo-ride， isosorbide mononitrate， and simvastatin).\n\n【39】DISCUSSION\n\n【40】Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening event. The danger recurs with every exposure to the responsible factor， which is why the identification of the factor is so vitally important. Besides food allergens and stinging insects' venom， drugs consti-tute a major cause of anaphylaxis. PPIs are considered to cause anaphylactic reactions very rarely. Only a few cases have been described despite the drugs'market availability for over 20 years now 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3，5-11\\]</u>. The case of omeprazole-induced anaphylaxis we describe is not only one of the very few clinical descriptions of such a reaction， but it also illus-trates the difficulties that can be encountered when diag-nosing omeprazole-induced anaphylaxis， a drug common-ly used by GPs， gastrologists， rheumatologists， and doctors of many other specializations.\n\n【41】Firstly， what hinders the diagnosis of PPI-triggered anaphy-laxis is the common conviction that the drugs are safe. The fact that PPIs cause anaphylactic reactions sporadically re-sults in their being bypassed as possible causative factors in a situation in which patients also use other medication. A report by Pimiento et al. provides evidence for such an un-derstanding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. They described the case of a 24-year-old woman who was regularly treated with piroxicam for dys-menorhea as well as with lansoprazole， which was used un-der medical recommendation for gastric protection. The patient presented pruritic erythrema， swelling of the palms and soles， malaise， nausea， dizziness， and loss of conscious-ness that developed within 30 minutes after simultaneously ingesting the two drugs. These symptoms were attributed to the effect of piroxicam. Given that the most frequent reac-tions are observed following the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs， a challenge was first performed with lansoprazole. To the surprise of the staff performing the chal-lenge， the result was positive， while the result of the subse-quently performed challenge with piroxicam was negative.\n\n【42】Secondly， another difficulty may be a faulty interpretation of the anaphylactic symptoms. Although usually typical and well known， anaphylactic symptoms may sometimes be atyp-ical and may disappear spontaneously， in which situation they can be overlooked or treated by both the doctor and the patient as symptoms of another disorder， in our case\n\n【43】angina pectoris. In the clinical picture of the cases of PPI anaphylaxis published so far， intense dermal-mucosal symp-toms (pruritus， urticaria， angioedema) which preceded the occurrence of respiratory-circulatory symptoms (broncho-constriction， hypotension， retrosternal pain， disturbed con-sciousness) have been reported. Thus Bowlby and Dickens described the first case of urticaria， angioedema， and bron-choconstriction that occurred after oral in take of omepra-zole 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， Confino-Cohen et al. described a man who， after ingestion of omeprazole， developed sweating， generalized itching， erythrema， angioedema of the face and hands， and hypotension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Galindo et al. described an anaphy-lactic reaction after omeprazole use； the patient developed a severe anaphylactic reaction which included sweating， paleness， abdominal pain， itching， dyspnea， and hypoten-sion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Pimiento et al. described the case of a 24-year-old woman who presented pruritic erythrema， swelling of the palms and soles， malaise， nausea， dizziness， and loss of con-sciousness that developed after ingesting lansoprazole 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Kollmeier et al. described a women who presented with ur-ticaria， Quincke's edema， and substernal chest discomfort after ingesting pantoprazole 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In the case we report，der-mal symptoms were very mild， while the dominant anaphy-lactic symptoms were substernal chest discomfort， dyspnea， hypotension， and impaired consciousness. Retrosternal pain in a person with coronary heart disease could have sug-gested stenocardial pain. The symptoms withdrew sponta-neously， which also implied an association with heart dis-ease. Only during a subsequent event of anaphylaxis did Quincke's edema become manifest， which provided proof that the reaction was allergic. The drug's role in the etiol-ogy of the described episodes was unquestionably proven since， firstly， the described episodes of anaphylactic symp-toms disappeared entirely after withdrawing omeprazole from treatment and， secon dly， hypersensitivity to omepra-zole was confirmed by the skin test.\n\n【44】Another diagnostic difficulty is the changing intensity of the symptoms， which initially can be mild for several times， only to take the form of severe anaphylaxis at a subsequent event. Such was our case， and Kollmeier et al. reported the same 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In the case we present， the episodes of anaphylax-is the patient suffered from were characterized by change-able symptomatology and uneven intensity of the symptoms. Similarly， Kollmeier et al. emphasized that the anaphylac-tic episodes recurred many times and the intensity of the symptoms was changeable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. They also observe that the symptoms appeared inconsistently， from a few hours to a few days after ingestion of the drug. They described the case of a 47-year-old Hispanic male who was referred to an aller-gy department for an evaluation of recurrent drug anaphy-laxis (urticaria， Quincke's edema， substernal chest discom-fort). The patient had previously experienced anaphylactic events a few times in the past 8 months， sequentially 3， 4，10， and 24 hours after a 40-mg tablet of pantoprazole. On the basis of the history， an elevated tryptase level at the time of the last incident， and a supportive skin test result， pan-toprazol was identified as the likely cause of his anaphylax-is. The authors suggested that the unusual timing of the onset of the symptoms might be explained by variations in the metabolic pathways of pantoprazole. A poor metabo-lizer phenotype is inherited in an autosomal recessive fash-ion in 2-5% of the white population and has been associat-ed with several inactivating genetic polymorphisms in the\n\n【45】CYP2C19gene. This gene encodes for the cytochrome P450enzyme responsible for， among others， the metabolism of pantoprazole 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In such a metabolizer， the plasma half-life of pantoprazole is prolonged.\n\n【46】The clinical characteristics of the reaction to PPIs referred to in most reports suggest an IgE-mediated mechanism dem-onstrated by positive skin-test results， which is also true with regard to the case we describe 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，3，13\\]</u>. The skin test with omeprazole was positive， but skin tests with other PPIs were also positive. Previous reports on reactions to PPIs suggest that there is cross-reactivity among various PPIs. Natsch et al. described cases of sequential reactions to omeprazole and lansoprazole in the same patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Cases of hypersensi-tivity to lansoprazole and rabeprazole have also been report-ed. Galindo et al. described a patient who experienced an allergic reaction after omeprazole， but whose skin tests were positive for both omeprazole and lansoprazole 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Our ob-servations are similar with regard to the double-positive test to omeprazole and pantoprazole， which suggests cross-Te-activity between alternative PPIs. A test with esomeprazole proved negative and， to our knowledge， no case of hyper-sensitivity to this drug has yet been described. On the basis of the previous reports of cross-reactivity， we decided not to challenge our patient with other PPIs because of the possi-ble risk of occurrence of an allergic reaction.\n\n【47】The decision to perform a challenge test with an H2 block-er was dictated by the fact that cross-reactivity among PPIs and all imidazoles has been postulated and supported by im-portant observations by Goday et al. and Izu et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，15\\]</u>. Although our findings and some other reports do not sus-tain this hypothesis， we are of the opinion that in every case a full diagnostic procedure should be implemented and provocation tests with H2 blockers have to be performed.\n\n【48】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【49】Considering that the problem of drug allergy is associated by most physicians mostly with a few groups of drugs such as antibiotics， aspirin， antianalgesics， or antiphlogistics， the case we report as well as the cited publications of other authors point to PPIs as possible causes of anaphylaxis. In the era of frequent PPI use and the suggestion that they should be-come available over the counter， there is a need for growing awareness of the potential risk the use of PPIs may involve.\n\n【50】REFERENCES：\n\n【51】1\\.

Fasciitis of the orbit is particularly concerning because of last-ing morbidity of the eye even after successful treatment of the fulminant systemic toxicity. The causative organism of NF is usually polymicrobial but streptococci and enterococci are the most common isolates. It can also be caused by anaero-bic organisms and occasionally Staphylococcus aureus or pseu-domonas species 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Predisposing factors are older age， male gender， diabetes mellitus， peripheral vascular disease， intra-venous drug use， and trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，3\\]</u>. The major determinant of survival is the time from admission to the operating room for debridement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Case Report\n\n【28】Our patient was a 60-year-old female nursing home aide with well controlled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD)， pulmonary histoplasmosis with subsequent right up-per lobe wedge resection， and well controlled hypertension who was transferred from an outside hospital (OSH) for eval-uation of left eye pain and swelling that persisted for three days prior to admission. The patient denied any direct trau-ma to the eye but stated that she works in the laundry area of a nursing home and comes into contact with sick patients and laundry chemicals； she was not aware of any specific in-cident of exposure. Of note， she was not on systemic steroids for COPD management. The OSH orbital computed tomogra-phy (CT) showed possible pre-septal cellulitis. Upon arrival to our facility's emergency department， she was noted to have significant erythema， swelling， and tenderness of the left up-per eyelid with edema extending down to the lateral aspect of the face and neck. The patient's near vision in the affected eye was 20/30， no relative afferent pupillary defect was pres-ent， and motility was significantly restricted in all directions of gaze. She was diagnosed with orbital cellulitis and start-ed on intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for empiric coverage. She also received timolol， dorzolamide， and brimonidine eye drops three times a day to the left eye.\n\n【29】After 48 hours on antibiotics， only minimal improvement in swelling was noted ； she continued to report a sig-nificant amount of pain. A repeat CT of the orbit with contrast showed significant worsening of the left sided or-bital cellulitis with interval development of a large abscess of the left eyelid and lateral orbit that extended into the extra-conal space. It also showed left-sided proptosis and straight-ening of the left optic nerve. On examination， the patient had progressive worsening swelling and pain. Clinical suspicion for\n\n【30】NF was high； therefore， she was taken to the operating room emergently for incision and drainage by the oculoplastic sur-gery service. Using a lid crease incision， the upper eyelid and superior orbit were extensively explored. Cheesy， white， necrot-ic-appearing tissue was noted . A small amount of pus was drained from the upper eyelid. A Penrose drain was placed， and the incision was loosely closed . Post-operatively， wound culture returned positive for methicillin-re-sistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). After consultation with the infectious disease (ID) service， her antibiotic therapy was narrowed to vancomycin alone. After 36 hours of careful ob-servation， lid and facial edema showed no improvement and continued to have significant areas of induration. She was taken back into the operating room for another debridement. The lid crease incision was reopened and a canthotomy and cantholysis were performed to gain greater exposure. The su-perior orbit， the upper lid， and the tissues lateral to the later-al canthus were explored. Fibrous white tissue was noted in the superior and lateral orbit， and also in the subcutaneous layers temporal to the lateral canthus. This tissue was avas-cular and did not bleed when incised； much of it was debrid-ed. Surgical pathology specimens were sent from the superior orbit， the orbital septum， preaponeurotic fat， and temporalis fascia； all were found to be fibrous. The hematoxylin and eo-sin stain noted marked acute inflammation and focal necro-sis . A second Penrose drain was placed. Finally， a partial tarsorrhaphy was placed to protect the ocular surface.\n\n【31】Post-procedure she was transferred to another tertiary care facility for hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT). The protocol used was HBOT therapy at 2.5 atmospheric absolute pressure for 90 minutes daily. She received a total of five treatments with two 5-minute air breaks after each 30 minutes of oxygen breathing. She clinically improved and was discharged with appropriate infectious diseases and oculoplastics follow-up.\n\n【32】Discussion\n\n【33】Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a surgical emergency that is often misdiagnosed as cellulitis or abscess. It can be triggered by a predisposing factor such as diabetes or a penetrating trau-ma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-6\\]</u>. Once it develops， the patient can present with rapidly progressive skin lesions fulminant septic shock 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Admission antibiotics sometimes mask the fulminant features of necro-tizing infections. Therefore， clinicians should have a high de-gree of suspicion of all bacterial skin infections especially if they continue to spread while on antibiotics. On physical ex-amination， lesions are typically warm and erythematous with tense edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However， clues such as crepitus， bullae for-mation， or pitting edema may help raise the index of suspi-cion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Patients will also present with systemic signs such as fever and altered mental status 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Laboratory data may\n\n【34】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

Roentgenographic evidence of subcutaneous gas or magnet-ic resonance imaging that shows soft tissue edema is also valuable in differentiating necrotizing versus non-necrotizing infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，11\\]</u>. Once a diagnosis of NF is suspected， the immediate and definite therapy should be surgical debride-ment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Postoperative broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated to cover streptococci， anaerobic polymicrobials， and MRSA. The incidence of MRSA as an etiology for NF has been on the rise 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy as an adjuvant to\n\n【36】surgery and antibiotics has shown to be beneficial in some clinical studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【37】Hypoxia present in hypo-perfused necrotic tissue often com-plicates wound healing. HBOT can double or triple oxygen de-livery to necrotic tissue thus increasing oxygen tension by up to 400 mm Hg resulting in improved wound healing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.Free radicals produced by HBOT therapy can also be bactericid-al and helpful in directly fighting active bacterial infections. Although the bactericidal effects of HBOT have been exten-sively studied and confirmed in clostridium myonecrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>，\n\n【38】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2.

Evans syndrome is often associated with underlying autoimmune disease， connective tissue disease， immune deficiency disorders， lymphoproliferative disorders， or malignancy of the immune system.

Evan and Duane first described the syndrome in 1951 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Evans syndrome is more common in the pediatric population than in adults and is of ten associated with underlying autoimmune disease， connec-tive tissue disease， immune deficiency disorders， lymphopro-liferative disorders， or malignancy of the immune system. Evans syndrome is classified as either primary or secondary， depending on the presence of underlying autoimmune disease or connective tissue disease. Associated diseases include sys-temic lupus erythematosus (SLE)， autoimmune lymphoprolif-erative syndrome (ALPS)， and immune deficiency disorders such as common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)， or lym-phoid malignancy， including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)， and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The degree of in-travascular hemolysis in Evans syndrome often results in he-moglobinemia， which may lead to hemoglobin cast nephrop-athy， acute tubular necrosis (ATN)， and acute kidney injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【33】Case Report\n\n【34】A 60-year-old man with a history of hypertension and obstruc-tive sleep apnea presented to an external hospital with sudden onset of severe low back pain and hematuria. He was anemic with initial investigations indicating a hemolytic process. He had acute kidney injury (AKl) and low to normal platelet lev-els. Due to concerns for the presence of thrombotic throm-bocytopenic purpura (TTP)， he was treated with high-dose steroids (methylprednisolone 1 g) and underwent plasma ex-change (PLEX). During his hospitalization， he developed acute renal failure with an acute rise in creatinine from 1.5 mg/dL to 7 mg/dL and a low urine output that required treatment with hemodialysis.\n\n【35】He was transferred to our hospital for further management. His recent medical history included a sore throat and body aches two weeks previously， recent use of ibuprofen， and jaundice that developed during the previous week. He reported a simi-lar history more than one year previously， which had been as-sociated with low blood counts. At that time， he was told that he had a viral illness that spontaneously resolved. He was also diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) at the time and was treated with rivaroxaban for three months.\n\n【36】On admission， physical examination showed that he was mild-ly jaundiced with scleral icterus and generalized peripheral edema. There was no evidence of petechiae， skin rash， or oral ulcers. His hemoglobin level had fallen to 6.0 g/dL， with a low haptoglobin of <8 mg/dL， increased serum levels of low-density\n\n【37】lipoprotein (LDL) of >3000 U/L， increased unconjugated total bilirubin of 4.1 mg/dL， and thrombocytopenia with platelet lev-els of 122x103/mcL.Renal failure was identified with the find-ings of serum creatinine (Cr) of 6.27 mg/dL and urinalysis that showed protein (2+)， and blood (3+). An initial peripheral blood smear showed spherocytes with no schistocytes. Serum ferri-tin levels were >40，000 ng/ml，and the white blood cell (WBC) count was 27x10/mcL， indicating a severe inflammatory re-sponse. Given his significant hematological changes and lab-oratory findings of renal failure， the differential diagnosis in-cluded thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)， hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)， systemic rheumatic disease， parox-ysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)， Evans syndrome，sep-sis with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)， and he-mophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH).\n\n【38】Treatment continued with 250 mg and methylprednisolone， and he was referred to the Departments of Hematology and Nephrology. Hematology investigations showed a positive direct Coombs test for autoimmune hemolytic anemia with ‘warm’lgG and C3d antibodies， and antiplatelet antibodies to glycopro-teins GPllb/llla，GPlb/IX， and GPla/lla. He had low ADAMTS-13activity (39%)， which was believed to be low secondary to high levels of free hemoglobin. The patient underwent tests for sec-ondary Evans syndrome and was found to have negative results for antinuclear antibody (ANA)， antineutrophil cytoplasmic an-tibody (ANCA)， extractable nuclear antigen (ENA)， anticardio-lipin antibody， but had no antibodies to lupus anticoagulant， and human immunodeficiency virus (HⅣ). Tests for paroxys-mal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)， the Donath-Landsteiner test for paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria， cold agglutinins， and serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) tests were all negative.\n\n【39】Treatment was commenced with prednisone 1 mg/kg for a to-tal of 30 days and intravenous rituximab 100 mg each week for four weeks. He underwent renal biopsy and histology， which showed hemoglobin cast nephropathy， and immuno-histochemistry showed that the casts were positive for he-moglobin， but there were with histological findings of micro-angiopathy .\n\n【40】Treatment with high-dose steroids and intravenous rituximab reduced hemolysis， improved renal function， and improved urine output. He was discharged from hospital on high-dose prednisone with plans to continue intravenous rituximab and intermittent hemodialysis. Following discharge from hospital， he underwent bone marrow biopsy， which showed mild hypo-cellularity and reduced hematopoiesis with no significant dys-plasia or increased blasts with no evidence of metastatic carci-noma， lymphoma， or granulomas. Flow cytometry showed no evidence of lymphoproliferative disorder or myeloid neoplasm.\n\n【41】Discussion\n\n【42】Evans syndrome includes warm' autoimmune hemolytic ane-mia and autoimmune thrombocytopenia and is caused by au-toantibodies that result in both platelet dysfunction and red blood cell damage. Evans syndrome occurs more commonly in children but can present in adults， with a mean age of >50years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Evans syndrome is diagnosed in less than 5% of pa-tients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) or au-toimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Evans syndrome is often more challenging to treat than AIHA alone， treatment often requires the use of steroids， and Evans syndrome has a high-er mortality rate than AIHA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【43】The pathophysiology of Evans syndrome remains unknown， but it is recognized as a condition of immune dysregulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Recent molecular theories include deficiencies of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4)， lipopolysaccharide responsive beige-like anchor protein (LRBA)， tripeptidyl peptidase 2 (TPP2)， and a reduced CD4/CD8 ratio 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Many cases are idiopathic， as was the case with this patient. To determine whether Evans syndrome is primary or idiopathic， underlying causes or sec-ondary causes of Evans syndrome should be excluded. There is an association between Evans syndrome and underlying\n\n【44】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

In a study reported by Michel et al.， up to 50% of cases of Evans syndrome were as-sociated with an underlying disorder， predominantly SLE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Common variable immunodeficiency was also seen in patients younger than 45 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was the most commonly associated disease in patients >50 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Although cases may be initially classified as idiopathic， with no underlying cause or association， as in this case， patients may still develop one of the main associated conditions later in life. Therefore， patients diagnosed with Evans syndrome re-quire close hematologic monitoring and follow-up.\n\n【47】Although there is no standard diagnostic approach to labora-tory tests for Evans syndrome， a systematic approach should be taken to screen patients for underlying or associated dis-eases. There is an association between Evans syndrome and underlying systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)， and investi-gations for the presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) and anti-double-stranded DNA should be undertaken 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Given that patients with Evans syndrome are at increased risk of throm-botic events， tests for anticardiolipin antibodies and a lupus anticoagulant test should also be considered. Also， an infec-tion screen should be performed to exclude infections with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)， hepatitis B virus (HBV)， and hepatitis C virus (HCV). In the adult age group of patients with Evans syndrome， serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP)，\n\n【48】and computed tomography (CT) imaging of the chest， abdo-men， and pelvis should be considered to exclude underlying malignancy， and cancer screening appropriate for age and gen-der should be performed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【49】First-line treatment consists of high-dose glucocorticoids， such as prednisone， at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg per day. Azathioprine， cyclophosphamide， danazol， and intravenous rituximab are often second-line treatment agents. In previous decades，the classic preferred second-line treatment was splenectomy， but the use of agents such as intravenous rituximab has become the preferred second-line treatments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【50】In this case， the severity of hemolysis resulted in acute renal failure secondary to heme pigment nephropathy . The degree of hemolysis saturates haptoglobin leaving free hemoglobin to damage the renal tubules. Patients will often have abnormal laboratory findings of anemia， increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)， reduced haptoglobin， and in-creased serum creatinine. Urine dipstick testing may be posi-tive for blood in the absence of erythrocytes.Other urine tests include pigmented granular casts and hemoglobinuria.\n\n【51】Hemolysis-associated hemoglobin cast nephropathy results from direct damage to the renal tubule from heme pigment through several mechanisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Damage occurs via renal vaso-constriction， direct tubular damage by the inflammatory effect of hemoglobin， and intraluminal cast formation， which plugs the tubules and damages the cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Hemoglobin pigment nephropathy caused by myoglobin is often seen and best de-scribed as a complication of rhabdomyolysis. Rarely， hemoglobin cast nephropathy occurs following intravascular hemolysis due to sepsis， paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)， valvular heart disease， and malaria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. It is rarely seen in association with Evans syndrome alone but has been reported in a pediat-ric case， diagnosed postmortem 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.

In ad-dition to hemoglobin pigment nephropathy， other uncommon complications associated with Evans syndrome have been re ported， including non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【64】Although rare， Evans syndrome in the adult population should be recognized and patients should be investigated for the presence of underlying hematological and immunological dis-orders. Patients with Evans syndrome are at increased risk of thromboembolic events， autoimmune and connective tissue disorders， and malignancy of the immune system at the time of diagnosis or even years later. Having a systematic diagnos-tic approach and undertaking basic laboratory investigations will help to identify causes and associations， if present， and improve the management of this condition and its complica-tions. Although exceeding rare， hemoglobin pigment nephrop-athy can be a cause of acute kidney injury in Evans syndrome and should be considered in the appropriate clinical context.\n\n【65】Conclusions\n\n【66】This case report has highlighted the importance of the recog-nition and diagnosis of Evans syndrome， as patients are at in-creased risk of underlying hematological and immunological disorders. In Evans syndrome， autoimmune hemolysis may re-sult in hemoglobin pigment nephropathy and acute kidney in-jury. Prompt diagnosis and treatment is important to reduce patient morbidity. A systematic diagnostic approach is help-ful， given that Evans syndrome is rare in the adult population and can be challenging to diagnose. Increased awareness of the rare complications associated with Evan syndrome should be considered in the correct clinical context.\n\n【67】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of interest</u>\n\n【68】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【69】通用结尾删除-1:<u>7\\.

When initiation of COCs is considered， it is therefore of paramount im-portance to carefully evaluate all other potential risk factors for VTE. Based on a case of life-threatening COC-associated pulmonary embolism in a girl heterozygous for the prothrombin G20210A mutation and with a fam-ily history of thrombotic disease， we discuss the importance of assessing not just the genotype but also the phenotype when considering initiation of COCs in patients with thrombophilia.\n\n【21】Case Report：\n\n【22】A 14-year-old girl presented with acute onset of chest pain and dyspnea followed by syncope. She was hypox-ic and hemodynamically compromised at admission.

She was successfully treated with thrombolysis (alteplase) fol-lowed by aPTT-adjusted heparin infusion until adequate anticoagulation with warfarin was achieved.\n\n【23】Two years earlier， the patient had been found heterozygote for the prothrombin G20210A mutation， and 9months before admission she had initiated use of second-generation COCs.\n\n【24】Conclusions：\n\n【25】Hereditary thrombophilia and a family history of early-onset venous thromboembolism (VTE) each pose an in-creased risk of VTE and should be considered as separate， irreversible risk factors. Other contraceptive meth-ods should be used when treatment with COCs is expected to result in an unacceptable high risk of VTE.\n\n【26】MeSH Keywords： Contraceptives， Oral， Hormonal·Thrombophilia·Venous Thrombosis\n\n【27】Full-text PDF http：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/894721\n\n【28】口19928 H\n\n【29】Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) are associated with a3-6 times higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) com-pared to non-users 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>.

She was transported to the hospita. by ambulance， where she was found hypoxic (saturation 87%)，tachycardic (heart rate125)， and hypotensive (systolic BP <100 mmHg). Acute echo-cardiography was performed (Video 1) and revealed dilatation of the right ventricle (“D-configuration\")， pulmonary hyperten-sion (tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient 50 mm Hg)， and reduced pulmonary blood flow. A highly elevated D-dimer (16.1mg/L) and a moderate increase in Troponin T (243 ng/L) was found. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography revealed a large central “saddle” pulmonary embolism causing nearly total occlusion of the right pulmonary artery ， and several minor peripheral embolisms bilaterally. Physical exam-ination was without clinical signs of deep venous thrombosis.\n\n【33】Because the patient was hemodynamically compromised， thrombolytic treatment with alteplase was initiated and fol-lowed by aPTT-adjusted heparin infusion. After termination of the infusion， low molecular weight heparin was initiated and continued until adequate anticoagulation with warfarin was achieved. Clinical treatment effect was observed within a few hours， and echocardiography on day 2 confirmed that the pulmonary pressure was reduced. At discharge on day 3， the patient was hemodynamically stable (BP 120/70 mm Hg， HR 85， and saturation 98%) with only a minor sensation of respiratory distress.\n\n【34】Due to several cases of both arterial and venous thrombosis at young age in at least 2 generations of the family， the patient had been tested for hereditary thrombophilia 2 years earlier；\n\n【35】Video 1.

Due to severe menstrual bleedings，she had initiated use of second-generation COCs containing 250 pg norgestimate and 35 ug ethinylestradiol once daily 9 months before admis-sion. The use of this contraceptive was discontinued at admis-sion， and she was strictly advised to never resume treatment.\n\n【38】Discussion\n\n【39】COC-users heterozygote for the prothrombin G20210A mu-tation have been found to have a 7-10-fold increased risk of VTE， with the risk being highest early in the course of COC use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8-10\\]</u>. This combination thus results in an at least additive and maybe even a synergistic prothrombotic effect. Whether the risk is further increased in individuals who additionally have\n\n【40】a thrombophilic phenotype is not known. However， a positive family history， defined as a documented VTE in a first-degree relative， is an established individual risk factor for VTE (3-fold VTE risk) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> and is therefore assumed to also be important in individuals with hereditary thrombophilia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【41】Current WHO guidelines advise against use of COCs in females with any known prothrombotic mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.

However， as emphasized by this case report， it is important to consider not just the inherited gen-otype but also the inherited phenotype when evaluating the risk of thrombosis.

The hepatic involvement of lupus is relatively less common， which creates diagnostic challenges， as the clinical presentations of lupus hepatitis and autoimmune hepatitis (AlH) are similar.\n\n【21】Case Report：\n\n【22】A 51-year-old woman presented for multiple joint pain that began 2 years ago. Her work-up， including kidney biopsy was consistent with a diagnosis of class V lupus nephritis. Subsequently within a few months， she was admitted with acute elevation of liver enzymes and high immunoglobulin IgG level， and a liver biopsy demon-strated impressive interface hepatitis with many plasma cells and lymphocytes， suggestive of chronic hepati-tis with high histological activity. This case illustrates the co-presentation of lupus nephritis and AlH， which is a rare association. The patient was managed with a tapering dose of prednisone， hydroxychloroquine initial-ly， and later with mycophenolate mofetil， with complete resolution of liver enzyme abnormalities by 4-month follow-up.\n\n【23】Conclusions： Lupus hepatitis is hepatic involvement of SLE， which should be distinguished from AIH. Accurate diagnosis is important， as management and prognosis of these immunologic conditions can differ. Although both entities share clinical and biochemical markers， the presence of anti-ribosomal P antibodies and liver histology fea-tures of predominant lymphoid infiltrates with lobular inflammation favor lupus hepatitis. A multidisciplinary approach involving rheumatologists， hepatologists， and pathologists can improve disease outcomes by prop-erly differentiating the 2 entities and guiding the selection of appropriate immunosuppressive therapy.\n\n【24】Keywords： Autoimmune Diseases ·Biopsy·Liver Diseases· Lupus Erythematosus， Systemic\n\n【25】Full-text PDE https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/940478\n\n【26】口117 1 7 1 4\n\n【27】20\n\n【28】Publisher's note： All daims expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of their affiliated\n\n【29】AP\n\n【30】organizations， or those of the publisher the editors and the reviewers.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is an immunogenic dis-order of the liver characterized by chronic liver inflammation due to autoantibodies， predominantly anti-smooth antibody(ASMA) and immunoglobulin IgG. Extrahepatic manifestations of AlH such as autoimmune thyroiditis， rheumatoid arthritis， and SLE resu lt from common immune-mediated pathways 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Hepatic involvement of SLE occurs in 50-60% of individuals during the spectrum of their disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. Overlapping syn-drome of SLE and AlH is an entity distinct from lupus hepa-titis that requires exclusion of other causes of elevated liver enzymes such as viral hepatitis， drug-induced liver injury， non-alcoholic fatty liver disease， alcohol-associated liver disease， hemochromatosis， Wilson disease， and other autoimmune liv-er diseases， including primary biliary cholangitis and prima-ry sclerosing cholangitis. Both SLE and AlH can present with common clinical presentations such as arthralgia， positive an-tinuclear antibodies (ANA)， and elevated immunoglobulin IgG level. Anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) is considered highly specific to SLE， but can also be positive in patients with AIH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>. Similarly， ASMA is positive in 99% of patients with SLE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The overlap of clinical and diagnostic modalities pos-es challenges in establishing diagnosis and management of patients with overlapping syndrome of SLE and AIH. We pres-ent a case of 51-year-old woman who initially presented with inflammatory arthritis and lupus nephritis， and subsequently developed autoimmune hepatitis.\n\n【33】A 51-Year-old African American woman with past medical histo-r notable only for breast cancer presented to the Rheumatology clinic for evaluation of multiple joint pain for 2 years.

She smoked half a pack of cigarettes per day， reported having 1-2drinks of alcohol per week， and denied recreational drugs abuse， recent change in her medications， or herbal supplements use.

Treatment was initiated with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 200 mg twice daily， prednisone 10 mg daily， and mycophenolate mofetil(MMF) 500 mg twice daily. She was lost to follow-up and was hospitalized 3 months later with jaundice， generalized pruri-tus， and acute elevation of liver enzymes， including ALT 418， AST 302， ALP 641， total bilirubin (TB) 6.40 (0.0-1.6) mg/dL，\n\n【34】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

HCQ and MMF were held， and she was dis-charged on oral prednisone 40 mg once daily. After 4 months of treatment with high-dose steroids (prednisone 40 mg daily)， the liver enzymes normalized. Hepatology considered starting azathioprine (AZA) for AlH， which historically has been the pre-ferred steroid-sparing agent for AIH. However， her proteinuria persisted， and Rheumatology considered azathioprine would be a suboptimal choice to treat lupus nephritis. After discuss-ing the options， Hepatology and Rheumatology services agreed MMF may be suitable to treat both AlH and lupus nephritis. She was restarted on hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice daily and MMF 1.5 g twice daily.\n\n【40】Discussion\n\n【41】Overlapping syndrome of SLE and AlH is an uncommon entity that was first reported in 1950. There is an overlap of clinical presentation， laboratory markers， and histology that makes it difficult to distinguish weather hepatic involvement is due to SLE， known as lupus hepatitis， or due to AlH， which are 2separate disorders.\n\n【42】Systemic lupus erythematosus is a systemic autoimmune con-dition that predominantly affects middle-aged women (fe-male-to-male ratio 10：1) with incidence rate of 0.3-31.5 cases per 100 000 persons yearly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.

This entity carries many challenges that start at the diagnosis， as most patients pres-ent with non-specific symptoms affecting different systems. As a result， the optimal approach， reaching the ac-curate diagnosis， and delivering needed treatment are delayed. Furthermore， it is not surprising that the initial set of biopsies are non-diagnostic given the heavy inflammatory background and scarcity of malignant cells in the early course of the disease. Other challenges include delivering the optimal curative therapy， as there is no such therapeutic option available yet. Although stem cell transplantation (SCT) can be considered a curative option， some patients have comorbidities and are not eligible for this option， and some other patients have re-lapse despite this aggressive approach， as was seen in our case.\n\n【18】Case Report： We present an interesting case of AITL with florid leukemic infiltration at the time of relapse. We included a description of the patient's symptoms， diagnostic challenges， and clinical course， and provided therapy with demonstrative peripheral blood and flow cytometry images. Interestingly， there are very few reports in the lit-erature that described leukemic infiltration of this entity.\n\n【19】Conclusions： Acknowledging the rarity of this aggressive lymphoma combined with all the challenges that face the involved health care workers， publishing this elaborative case report adds some insight and knowledge and helps im-prove our understanding of this entity.\n\n【20】Keywords： Lymphoma·Lymphoma， Non-Hodgkin· Recurrence · Stem Cell Transplantation\n\n【21】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/936448\n\n【22】Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) is a rare and ag gressive lymphoma， with most patients presenting at an ad-vanced stage of the disease. The diagnosis can be challenging and difficult to reach， as in some patients， the initial histology shows extensive reactive features with no definite malignant pathology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This results in diagnostic challenges and delays in accurate diagnosis and delivering appropriate treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. We present an interesting case of AITL with florid leukemic in-filtration at the time of disease relapse that was not evident at the time of diagnosis. Description of the patient's symptoms， diagnostic approaches， clinical course and provided therapeu-tic modalities are included， with the corresponding peripheral blood and flow cytometry results. Interestingly， leukemia in-filtration of this entity has rarely been reported with certain-ty. Furthermore， according to the World Health Organization(WHO)， there is no mention of a leukemic phase. To the best of our knowledge， this is the first reported case with leukemic infiltration at the time of relapse.\n\n【23】Case Report\n\n【24】A 45-year-old woman sought medical care at our center in2017 with a 1-month history of fever， loss of appetite， weight loss， and general malaise. At that time， a physical examination showed multiple enlarged non-tender cervical lymph nodes(bilateral， the largest measured 2x3 cm on the left side). Her initial complete blood count (CBC) showed a white blood cell count (WBC) of 13.7×10/L with a normal differential， hemo-globin of 81 g/L with microcytic hypochromic red blood cells(RBCs)， and platelets count of 186x10°/L. These findings war-ranted further evaluation that included a computed tomogra-phy (CT) scan， which revealed generalized lymphadenopathy that extended above and below the diaphragm， in addition to an enlarged spleen. Furthermore， a positron emission to-mography (PET) scan was done that demonstrated hyperac-tivity of the lymph nodes and spleen. Accordingly， the patient underwent multiple excisional lymph node biopsies， in addi-tion to a bone marrow biopsy and splenectomy， in search of the underlying pathology. Unfortunately， none of these biop-sies showed any clonal/malignant process and were inconclu-sive at that time. As a result， the patient was followed close-ly at the Hematology Clinic at our center. Around 2 months later， in September 2017， the patient started to report more weight loss and fever. Repeated physical examination re-vealed enlarged tonsils with exudative discharge， along with her previously documented enlarged cervical lymph nodes. Consequently， the team's decision was to repeat evaluation of the lymph nodes by performing new excisional biopsies， which now showed morphological and immunophenotyp-ic features compatible with AITL As a result， the patient was\n\n【25】started on CHOEP (cyclophosphamide， doxorubicin， vincris-tine， etoposide， and prednisone) regimen in November 2017. By January 2018， she had received a total of 4 cycles of that regimen. Unfortunately， a reassessment CT scan showed pro-gressive disease. The patient decided to seek further medical care abroad， where she received 2 cycles of salvage therapy； ICE (ifosfamide， carboplatin， and etoposide)， as per her med-ical file. Despite this intensive regimen， she did not respond. Therefore， she was given GDP (gemcitabine， dexamethasone， and cisplatin) as a second salvage therapy， followed by autol-ogous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in August 2018. After recovery， the patient came back and was seen as an outpa-tient at our center\n\n【26】Two months later， she started to have progressively enlarged inguinal lymph nodes， along with new skin lesions on her trunk and upper limbs. Cutaneous and nodal biopsies confirmed a re-lapsed AITL. At the time of her relapse， her CBC showed a high WBC count (75.9×10°/L) with a predominance of lymphocytes with an absolute count of 56.17x10°/L ， hemoglobin of 93 g/L， and platelets count of 128x10/L Multiparameter flow cytometry was performed on her peripheral blood and detected a clonal T lymphocytes population  with a positive T cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement that was confirmed by molecular studies. It was such a challenging case with a poor prognosis， presenting with a disease relapse de-spite several courses of chemotherapy in addition to an ASCT. After discussing available options in a multidisciplinary team and with the patient， we planned to administer brentuximab and nivolumab as salvage chemotherapy. Although the lym-phocytes count dropped initially， it showed a rebound before her next scheduled cycle. Unfortunately， shortly after the sec-ond cycle， her disease progressed and she died.\n\n【27】Discussion\n\n【28】Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AlTL) is a distinct and generally aggressive lymphoma that arises from mature T follic-ular helper cells (TFH) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. It constitutes 1-2% of all non-Hodg-kin lymphomas and about 15-30% of peripheral T cell lympho-mas (PTCL) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，4\\]</u>. Most patients present at an advanced stage with acute onset of various symptoms. Symptoms are usually non-specific and include generalized lymphadenopathy， hepa-tosplenomegaly， pruritic skin rash， serositis， and constitution-al symptoms. Usual laboratory findings include presence of a polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia and circulating immune complexes (eg， cold agglutinins， rheumatoid factor， and anti-smooth muscle antibodies) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>. The diagnosis is usually con-firmed by morphological assessment of an excisional lymph node biopsy with further immunophenotyping. Morphological assessment of tissue sections shows effacement of the nor-mal architecture by a rich background of reactive cells that in\n\n【29】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1. Peripheral smear showing high (A， B) and low power images (C， D) of the lymphoma cells that are medium in size with high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio， partially dispersed chromatin with inconspicuous nucleoli and some nuclear convolutions. The cytoplasm is moderately basophilic with some vacuoles.</u>\n\n【30】most cases include Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive B immu-noblasts and other inflammatory cells with prominent endo-thelial venules that are best demonstrated with special stains for follicular dendritic cells. Large atypical lymphoma cells are seen intermixed with the reactive cells and are usually posi-tive for CD3， CD4， and other normally expressed TFH cell anti-gens like CD10. These malignant cells can further express ab-errant markers or lose antigens that are typically expressed on normal T cells； CD7 is an example， and its loss indicates an aberrancy (as was seen in our presented case). Of note， reach-ing the diagnosis can be very challenging， especially early in the disease course， when the prominent features are mainly heavy inflammatory elements. Additional molecular testing to detect the presence of TCR gene rearrangement can assist in reaching the diagnosis by confirming the clonal nature of the T cells， especially in challenging cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【31】Despite the fact that most patients present with an advanced-stage disease with multisystem involvement， spread to the peripheral blood has rarely been reported with certainty. Furthermore， the WHO classification of lymphoid malignancies\n\n【32】does not include a leukemic phase of AITL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In 1983， Pangalis et al examined peripheral blood smears and bone marrow of a case series that included 38 patients； they detected atypi-cal lymphocytes in 12 patients and described them as“immu-nocytes\"， but immunophenotyping confirmation was not yet available 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In 2006， Bassiggio et al were the first group to detect and report circulating neoplastic CD10 positive T cells in patients diagnosed with AITL. They examined 6 peripheral blood smears of 12 patients diagnosed with AITL. Interestingly， all the smears showed atypical lymphoid cells by morphological inspection and a subset of CD10-positive T cells using a 4-col-or flow cytometry analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. On the other hand， Mourad et al reported a large case series that included 157 patients diagnosed with AITL treated within the GELA trials in 2008. They found that 60% of patients with anemia had bone mar-row involvement. However， peripheral blood examination and description (ie， presence of lymphoma cells in the peripheral blood) was not included 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In 2014， Lin et al reported a pa-tient who was diagnosed with AITL with florid blood dissem-ination but CD10 was negative on the lymphoma cells (the same finding was noted in the present case) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【33】Altahan R. et al：\n\n【34】Due to the previously reported primary progression and/or short duration of remission (DOR)， 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，14\\]</u> and because the current evidence is based on descriptive reports and limited comparison studies to other PTCL subtypes， the latter being due to the low incidence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>， there is no standard therapeu-tic regimen for this entity. Adopting a risk-based approach is proposed until we have a recommended regimen based on clinical trials and good-quality evidence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【35】The CHOP regimen remains the most-used intensive regimen in PTCL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. With a reported 53% complete response (CR) when used as a first-line therapy for AITL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>， the addition of eto-poside to CHOP (CHOEP) shows an overall response rate (ORR) of 82% and a CR of 51% in the management of PTCL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>and better progression-free survival (PFS) in young and fit patients when compared to CHOP alone. However， it has higher toxicity in patients older than 60 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Based on the available ev-idence， CHOEP was given to our patient as a first-line therapy.\n\n【36】Management of patients with relapse/refractory (R/R) disease should include careful assessment of the patient's eligibility for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>， although this can be very challenging given the disease-related symptoms and comorbidities that most patients have 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，19\\]</u>. Delivery of high-dose therapy (HDT) followed by ASCT (HDT-ASCT) is considered the standard of care for R/R lymphomas， includ-ing PTCL However， results are dismal in PTCL patients， with a relapse rate over 80% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18，20\\]</u>. A multicenter study that evalu-ated long-term disease-free survival in 29 patients with AITL after HDT-ASCT found that 5-year overall and event-free sur-vival were 44% and 37%， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【37】There is no standard salvage therapy to be delivered before SCT in this setting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.

Furthermore， in patients who received ASCT， the 2-year EFS and OS were 21%and 42%， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Other regimens， such as ICE (ifos-famide， carboplatin， and etoposide)， have been investigated and showed similar results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22，24\\]</u>.\n\n【40】The addition of monoclonal antibodies directed against some of the antigens expressed by neoplastic lymphoma cells showed an impressive improvement in B cell lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Brentuximab vedotin (BV) is an anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody-drug con-jugate， and since CD30 is expressed in most AITL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>， BV has been investigated as a promising agent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18，26\\]</u>. A significant improvement in PFS (48.2 months) was seen in patients treat-ed with BV combined with CHP compared to CHOP for CD30-positive PTCL in the ECHELON-2 study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18，27\\]</u>.\n\n【41】Preclinical data shows that programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is overexpressed in neoplastic cells in PTCL It interacts with the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) that is expressed on activated T lymphocytes， thus provides suppressive antitumor immunity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>.Although the use of anti-PD-1-blocking mono-clonal antibodies has shown impressive results， especially in the treatment of relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma， early results in PTCL were not as impressive. A recent phase 2 prospective study that evaluated the effect of nivolumab (a PD-1-blocking antibody) as a single agent for patients with relapse/refracto-ry PTCL was halted due to the short duration of response and the moderate activity of the drug， and half of their patient co-hort had AITL (6/12 patients). The role of this agent should be explored in future studies but as a combination regimen rath-er than a single agent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>.\n\n【42】The challenges described in this case， starting early at the time of presentation with deceiving initial morphological features that not surprisingly caused a delay in reaching the accurate diagnosis， to delivering optimal front-line therapy， to finally dealing with a disease relapse after many courses of inten-sive therapies， demonstrate the difficulties facing health care practitioners around the world. To the best of our knowledge， this is the first reported case of AITL that shows an overt leu-kemic phase at the time of relapse that was not document-ed at the initial presentation. Adding this elaborative case to the literature confirms the challenging nature and improves our overall understanding of the characteristics of this aggres-sive and rare entity.\n\n【43】References：\n\n【44】1\\.

There are no reports describing membranous glomerulonephritis caused by non-tuberculous mycobacterium infection. However， several cases with membranous glomerulonephritis due to Mycobacterium tubercutosis have been reported. Mycobacterium shimoidei is an uncommon pathogen， and less than 20 cases with this species have been reported. A thera-peutic regimen for this infection has not been established yet.\n\n【28】Case Report： An 83-year-old Japanese man presented with productive cough for 6 months. Computed tomography scan showed multiple cavities in the bilateral pulmonary fields. Acid-fast bacilli were evident in his sputum by Ziehl-Neelsen staining (Gaffky 3). PCR amplifications for Mycobacterium tuberculosis， Mycobacterium avium， and\n\n【29】Mycobacterium intracettutare were all negative. Finally， Mycobacterium shimoidei was identified by rpoB se-\n\n【30】quencing and 16S rRNA sequencing. Urine examination showed a sub-nephrotic range of proteinuria and his-tology of the kidney showed membranous glomerulonephritis. Antimycobacterial treatment with clarithromy-cin， rifampicin， and ethambutol dramatically improved not only the pulmonary disease， but also the proteinuria. Conclusions： To the best of our knowledge， the presented case is the first report showing non-tuberculous mycobacterium-induced secondary membranous glomerulonephritis. A combination with clarithromycin， ethambutol， and ri-fampicin might be effective for treatment of Mycobacterium shimoidei infection.\n\n【31】Key words： non-tuberculous· mycobacterium ·shimoidei · membranous glomerulonephritis · proteinuria\n\n【32】Full-text PDF http：//www.amjcaserep.com/download/index/idArt/889684\n\n【33】Mycobacterium shimoidei (M. shimoidei) was first described in\n\n【34】1975 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and gained species status in 1982 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.

Tuberculosis-like cavitation is the most common radiographic finding in M. shimoidei pulmonary disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. A therapeutic regimen for this disease has not been established yet.\n\n【35】It is well-known that membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) can occur secondarily from malignancy， drugs and toxic substances， collagen diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus，and infectious diseases， including hepatitis B， quartan malaria， and schistosomiasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Several cases with MGN due to M. tuber-culosis have also been reported without classical renal tuber-culosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17，18\\]</u>. However， there are no reports describing MGN caused by non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) infection.\n\n【36】Here， we describe a case of MGN associated with Mycobacterium shimoidei pulmonary infection. Antimycobacterial treatment with clarithromycin， rifampicin， and ethambutol dramatically im-proved not only the pulmonary disease， but also the proteinuria.\n\n【37】Case Report\n\n【38】He had no fever. His sputum was yellowish. He had smoked60 pack-years until 50 years of age. He had no past history of illness. He was a tobacco farmer and had also raised silk-worms. On physical examination， there was no lymphadenop-athy， no clubbing， and no edema. SpO， was 98% and blood pressure was 150/80 mmHg. His vesicular sound was slight-ly decreased throughout both lung fields and no crackle was auscultated. A chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan showed emphysematous changes and multiple cavities in the bilateral pulmonary fields . Laboratory test re-sults were as follows： WBC， 6500/pl； RBC， 3.29 million/pl； he-moglobin， 9.9 g/dl； MCV， 94.5 fl； MCH， 30.1 pg； total protein，6.8 g/dl； albumin， 3.0 g/dl； total cholesterol， 167 mg/ml； BUN，29.4 mg/ml； Cr， 1.57 mg/ml； and CRP， 1.34 mg/ml. Urine exam-ination showed a sub-nephrotic range of proteinuria (3.1 g/gCr) and many hyaline casts (>50/total fields) in the urinary sedi-ment. Pulmonary function tests showed low%VC (70.8%) and normal range of FEV1.0% (78.1%). Acid-fast bacilli were evi-dent in his sputum by Ziehl-Neelsen staining (Gaffky 3). PCR\n\n【39】amplifications for Mycobacterium tuberculosis，Mycobacterium\n\n【40】avium， and Mycobacterium intracellulare were all negative.\n\n【41】Numerous colonies of acid-fast bacilli appeared upon culture. DNA-DNA hybridization，which can detect 18 species of acid-fast bacilli using cultured colonies， failed to identify the spe-cies. The mycobacterial characteristics of a sputum sample obtained on another day were exactly the same as those of the first sample. Finally， Mycobacterium shimoidei was identi-fied by rpoB sequencing and 165 rRNA sequencing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>，with100% homology to the sequences.\n\n【42】Renal tissue samples obtained by renal biopsy mainly showed membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN)， with partial\n\n【43】An 83-year-old Japanese man had suffered from productive cough for 6 months and visited our hospital in March 2011.\n\n【44】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

In addition， the mesan-gial areas were slightly enlarged and mesangial cells had pro-liferated in part . Electron-dense deposits were ob-served in the mesangial areas as well as the subepithelium\n\n【47】and basement membranes . Immunofluorescence analyses showed positive staining for lgG， IgA， and IgM in the basement membranes (data not shown). No granulomatous change was observed in the renal tissue samples. No acid-fast bacilli were detected by Ziehl-Neelsen staining.\n\n【48】Because the productive cough continued，M. tuberculosis was excluded， and a new lesion appeared on his chest X-ray，anti-mycobacterial treatment (clarithromycin， 400 mg/d； rifampi-cin， 300 mg/d； and ethambutol， 500 mg/d) was started before the identification of M. shimoidei. Candesartan (80 mg/d)，an angiotensin Il receptor blocker (ARB)， was also started. After1 month of treatment， the species was identified as M. shi-moidei and the initial treatment was continued. The isolate was sensitive to ethambutol， streptomycin， kanamycin， en-viomycin， ethionamide， and levofloxacin， and was resistant to isoniazid， rifampicin， cycloserine， and para-aminosalicylic acid， in in vitro drug sensitivity tests. At 2 months after start-ing the treatment， his sputum was clearly decreased. After6 months of treatment，acid-fast bacilli were not detected by either Ziehl-Neelsen staining or 8-week culture， and the chest CT findings were also improved (data not shown). He contin-ued antimycobacterial treatment for an additional 1 year (18months in total) in accordance with the statement from the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. The amount of urine protein decreased grad-ually after initiation of the antimycobacterial treatment and ARB， and reached 0.6 g/gCr. The serum albumin level recov-ered to 3.6 g/dl at the end of the treatment.\n\n【49】Discussion\n\n【50】In the present case， several findings suggest that MGN was sec-ondarily induced by an NTM， but not idiopathic MGN. First， the antimycobacterial treatment and ARB dramatically improved the proteinuria as well as the pulmonary disease. Second，the mesangial areas were slightly enlarged histologically. In addi-tion， electron-dense deposits were observed in the mesangial areas as well as the subepithelium and basement membranes. Third， no other disease that could cause MGN was detected. Fourth， the CT findings showed a tuberculosis-like fibrocavitary pattern， but no nodular/bronchiectatic pattern， which might have the potential to induce glomerular diseases.\n\n【51】In several cases with MGN due to M. tuberculosis， urinary pro-tein excretion caused by MGN was improved by treatment with antituberculosis agents with or without prednisolone (30mg/d) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17，18\\]</u>. Some patients with tuberculosis present glo-merular diseases other than MGN， including IgA nephropa-thy， focal proliferative glomerulonephritis， and focal segmen-tal glomerulosclerosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21-24\\]</u>. Regarding the mechanisms by which tuberculosis causes glomerular diseases， immune\n\n【52】responses may be involved. M. tuberculosis was reported to induce both cellular and humoral immune responses when the bacilli invade the body 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. M. tuberculosis infection can lead to disturbance of Th1/Th2 cells， which may give rise to nephritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Immune complexes were reported to be de tectable at high levels in the active phase of disseminated tuberculosis， suggesting an association with humoral immu-nity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Thus， MGN could be induced indirectly by pulmo-nary tuberculosis.\n\n【53】Candesartan has been reported to exert a protective effect on the kidney. In patients with non-nephrotic proteinuria(0.5-3.5 g/d)， candesartan alone reduced proteinuria， by an average of 13% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Therefore， candesartan may have con-tributed somewhat to the improvement in proteinuria in the present case. However， the proteinuria was dramatically im-proved in the present case (80% reduction)， suggesting that the treatment for NTM had a greater effect on the proteinuria.\n\n【54】Regarding the pathology of MGN， enlargement of mesangial areas and proliferation of mesangial cells are sometimes ob-served in secondary MGN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27-29\\]</u>. Moreover， mesangial elec-tron-dense deposits are uncommon in idiopathic MGN， and a secondary form of MGN should be excluded when they are present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27-29\\]</u>. In the present case，these pathologic findings were observed， and no causes of MGN were identified except for mycobacterium infection.\n\n【55】Taken together， these findings and therapeutic outcome clear-ly suggest that the MGN in the present case was associated with M.shimoidei infection.\n\n【56】The radiographic features of NTM pulmonary disease include2 patterns： fibrocavitary disease similar to tuberculosis and nodular/bronchiectatic disease characterized by nodules and bronchiectasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. It is noteworthy that a nodular/bronchiec-tatic pattern without cavitation has never been reported in M.\n\n【57】References：\n\n【58】1\\.

On the other hand， cavity forma-tion was observed in 11 of 15 available cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，3-15\\]</u>. Since cavitation is accompanied by destruction of the lung struc-ture， immune responses may occur more strongly in fibrocav-itary diseases compared with nodular/bronchiectatic diseas es， which may lead to glomerular diseases.\n\n【66】Antibiotic sensitivity data were sparse or absent for some re-ported cases. However， all 11 tested cases were resistant to isoniazid， and 7 of 11 cases were resistant to rifampicin. On the other hand， 11 of 12 cases were sensitive to ethambutol. Although the number of cases tested was small， 3 of 3 were sensitive to rifabutin， 3 of 3 were sensitive to pyrazinamide， and 2 of 3 were sensitive to clarithromycin. All 4 cases， includ-ing the present case， improved when treated with clarithro-mycin，ethambutol， and rifampicin (or rifabutin) for 6 months通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，14，15\\]</u>. Although a therapeutic regimen has not been es-tablished， these could be key drugs for the treatment of M. shimoidei. Compared with pulmonary tuberculosis， NTM is generally resistant to antimycobacterial treatment. This may also make it difficult to confirm that the giomerular disease is caused by NTM infection.\n\n【67】Conclusions\n\n【68】The present case is the first report showing NTM-induced sec-ondary MGN. Tuberculosis-like symptoms and cavity formation on CT are typical clinical features of M. shimoidei pulmonary disease. A therapeutic regimen with clarithromycin，ethambu-tol， and rifampicin might be effective for M. shimoidei infection.\n\n【69】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【70】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There were no sources of funding for this study.

It is well known that swollen painless lymph nodes are the most com-mon symptoms of systemic lymphoma. Here， we report a case of DLBCL with 3 fast-growing large subcutaneous tumors lo-cated in the right groin and the chest wall， accompanied with unilateral lower-extremity edema and rib lesions.\n\n【34】Case Report\n\n【35】A 41-year-old man complained of a 3-month history of a fast-growing lymph node in the right groin， and a 2-month history\n\n【36】of 3 subcutaneous tumors in the right posterior chest wall and the right lateral chest wall. One month ago， the man began to experience right groin pain and surface ulceration and crusting of the swollen lymph node， resulting in right lower-extremity swelling and limited mobility. During the course of this case， the man complained of over 5 kg of weight loss， but not symp-toms of fever， night sweat， hemorrhage， cough， or chest pain. He had a history of blood transfusion about 20 years ago， but had no history of sexual contact with men.

Classically， these infections occur in immunosuppressed patients (neutropenic patients， bone marrow and solid organ transplant recipients， HIV/AIDS patients) or patients on immunosuppressive regimens such as corticosteroids and or， chemotherapy. There has been also increasing reports of IA in patients with non-classic risk fac-tors (surgery， cirrhosis， chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-ease， malignancy， and cystic fibrosis) as well as described in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\n\n【25】Occasionally， A. furnigatus infection displays unusual clin-ical features， posing a challenging diagnosis for the clini-cian. Failure to recognize and delays in treatment of these fungal infections increases the risk of an adverse clinical outcome. We present a case of invasive aspergillosis with unusual endobronchial features.\n\n【26】CASE REPORT\n\n【27】A 36-year-old-female with history of SLE was admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Her initial com-plaints included fever， shortness of breath， cough with spu-tum production， and ulcers in oral region for two weeks. The patient denied hemoptysis. Her SLE had affected the cutaneous and musculoskeletal systems. Although she was previously on metothrexate treatment， she had not been taking immunosuppresants for 6 months. She had a histo-ry of 20 pack/year tobacco use.\n\n【28】In the emergency department vital signs were significant for hypotension， tachycardia and tachypnea along with fe-ver of 101.6°F (38.7C) and spO2 93% on 4L/min via nasal cannula. Her physical exam was remarkable for respiratory distress， bibasilar lung dullness， and distal phalanx erythem-atous nodules . Her complete blood cell count showed a WBC 2.5×10° cells/uL (neutrophilis 83%， lym-phocytes 14%)， hemoglobin 8.5 mg/dl， and platelet count116 cells/uL. Her arterial blood gases were remarkable for hypoxemia. Chest radiograph displayed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and pleural effusions .\n\n【29】Upon deterioration of her respiratory status and severe hy-poxemia， she was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and mechanical ventilation was initiated. On ICU day l a chest computed tomogram (CT) showed bibasilar infiltrates and bilateral pleural effusions . A flexible bron-choscopy (FB) with bronchoalveclar lavage (BAL) was per-formed. Right mainstem bronchus and right lower lobe en-dobronchial lesions were present . These white papular areas were amenable to sampling using a protect-ed endobronchial brush. As her condition progressively deteriorated，antifungal coverage and stress dose steroids were initiated.\n\n【30】On ICU day 2， the BAL revealed growth ofseptated hyphae， consistent with A. fumigatus. Serum and BAL galactoman-nan assays were positive. Antifungal agent was changed to voriconazole. Her hospital stay was complicated with car-diogenic shock requiring Intra aortic balloon pump (IABP) and inotropics. Although an endomyocardial biopsy was\n\n【31】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

Prompt initiation of voriconazole resulted in pro-gressive overall clinical improvement， and she was able to be weaned from the IABP， vasopressors， and mechanical\n\n【35】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4. Bronchoscopic examination demonstrating endobronchiallesions.</u>\n\n【36】ventilation. She remained hospitalized for a total of 30 days， to be discharged to skilled nursing facility. At one month out-patient follow-up the patient had returned to her baseline.\n\n【37】DISCUSSION\n\n【38】We describe an unusual presentation of aspergillus fumiga-tus infection， in which extensive endobronchial and possi-bly endomyocardial fungal involvement resulted in cardio-respiratory collapse. A variety of clinical manifestations have been described in Aspergillus fumigatus infection：1) allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA)， 2) pulmonary as-pergilloma，3) chronic necrotizing pneumonia， and 4) in-vasive aspergillosis. In a series among intensive care unit patients， 3% of the autopsies displaved evidence of dissem-inated A. fumigatus infection. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u> Patterns of endobron-chial aspergillosis include： 1) mucous plugs in bronchiec-tatic areas； 2) endoluminal mass-like obstructive lesions；3) bronchiolithiasis； 4) airway narrowing and abundant granulation tissue， especially in surgical anastomosis； 5) polypoid lesions； 6) eroded bronchial walls 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-6\\]</u>. In cases of suspected aspergillus fumigatus pulmonary infection， a bronchoscopy with bronchioalveolar lavage is warranted， as this diagnostic modality is >90% specific for detection of this organism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Our patient displayed signs ofendobronchi-al involvement， although there was no visible obstruction， airway narrowing or mucosal erosion at the time of bran-choscopic examination.\n\n【39】Invasive aspergillosis complicating systemic lupus erythema-tosus is a rare entity， which carries a high mortality (>95%) and may result in various sequelae 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>. It has been de-scribed that SLE induced vasculitis may result in mucocu-taneous breakdown， and impaired humoral and cellular immunity predispose these immunocompromised hosts to more severe forms of aspergillus fumigatus infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，11\\]</u>.\n\n【40】Cutaneous manifestations of IA are a rare entity， and may be encountered in up to 2% of the patients with disseminat-ed disease. Skin examination may display plaques or pap ules， often violaceous to erythematous. Later in the course\n\n【41】of the disease， these lesions evolve into black eschars. The skin lesions present in our patient resolved within days of initiation of antifungal regimen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，13\\]</u>.\n\n【42】Although unconfirmed， it is possible that IA may have af-fected our patient's cardiovascular system. Aspergillus endo-myocarditis carries a >50% associated mortality， and should be included in the differential diagnosis in immunocom-promised patients presenting with cardiocirculatory shock. In confirmed aspergillus endocarditis case， prompt surgical consultation should be sought， as an early aggressive surgi-cal approach may be warranted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【43】Pulmonary involvement in IA is usually multifocal and mac-ronodular. Secondary invasion by A. fumigatus should be suspected in patients with evidence of new focal or nodular disease， especially on those with a history of previous fungal disease. Radiologically， nodules and cavitation may be en-countered. The “halo” (mass with peripheral ground glass opacification) and\"air crescent\"(radiolucid crescen ts sur-rounding nodules) signs suggest pulmonary aspergillosis， although these finding may be absent among non-neutre-penic patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【44】Especially in the fungal replication and growth phase，lab-oratory studies assist in the diagnosis of A. fumigatus infec-tion. Galactomannan assay detects A. fumigatus wall com-ponents in body fluids. Brochioalveolar galactomannan positivity indicates respiratory involvement， whereas posi-tive serum galactomannan assays raise the possibility of in-vasive fungal disease.\n\n【45】Treatment in invasive aspergillosis consists of intravenous antifungals (azoles， polyenes， echinocandins) and aggres-sive supportive measures. Early involvement of an infectious diseases specialist is suggested.\n\n【46】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【47】This case highlights the importance of a high index of suspi-cion for fungal diseases， especially in critically ill hosts with\n\n【48】endobronchial lesions. Our objective is to raise awaren已SS of uncommon features of invasive aspergillosis， as adverse clinical outcomes may occur if these patterns are unrecog nized by the clinician. The increasing incidence of IA in pa-tients with active rheumatologic conditions， and its associ-ated mortality among critically ill subjects warrants further research in this field.\n\n【49】Consent\n\n【50】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying im-ages.

Wilson disease is a rare， autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism and can present with neuropsy-chiatric symptoms secondary to copper accumulation in the brain.\n\n【27】Case Report： We describe the case of a 48-year-old man with parkinsonism on a background of longstanding schizophre-\n\n【28】nia and psychotic depression in the setting of previously undiagnosed Wilson disease. The common history of neuropsychiatric disturbance and neuroleptic use complicated the assessment of parkinsonism. However， close attention to the temporal appearance of symptoms and signs differentiated his case from drug-induced parkinsonism， which commonly develops hours to weeks after commencement or uptitration of antipsychotic medication. The early features of sialorrhea and dysarthria were also atypical for idiopathic Parkinson disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by serum copper testing and supported by Kayser-Fleischer rings on bedside oph-thalmological examination. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain demonstrated copper accumula-tion in the basal ganglia and pons， contributing to the characteristic neurological manifestations of an akinet-\n\n【29】ic-rigid syndrome with dysarthria.\n\n【30】Conclusions： Serum copper testing is easily obtained and should be considered as part of the first-line investigations for new neuropsychiatric disturbances. Although rare， Wilson disease， if diagnosed early， is a potentially treat-able and reversible cause of psychosis. With advanced disease， extrapyramidal findings on examination cor-relate with MRI brain changes， aiding the clinical assessment in differentiating the disease from drug-induced parkinsonism.\n\n【31】Keywords： Copper-Transporting ATPases· Parkinson Disease， Secondary·Psychotic Disorders\n\n【32】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/940561\n\n【33】Publisher's note： All daims expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of their affiliated\n\n【34】AP\n\n【35】organizations， or those of the publisher the editors and the reviewers.

In a small proportion of patients， psychosis is due to secondary causes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Wilson disease is a rare， autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism due to mutations in ATP7B， which encodes atransmembrane cop per-transporting ATPase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The accumulation of copper in the brain can lead to neurological and psychiatric symptoms. Personality changes in patients with Wilson Disease are a com-mon first symptom， whereas the prevalence of acute psycho-sis ranges from 1.4% to 11.3% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.Kayser-Flesicher rings are invariably present in patients with neurological symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Serum copper and caeruloplasmin levels have high positive predictive value for diagnosing Wilson disease in the correct clinical context but are not always performed routinely 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-4\\]</u>.\n\n【37】Advanced，untreated Wilson disease manifesting as parkinson-ism can be confused with drug-induced parkinsonism where there is a common history of neuroleptic use. Here， we de-scribe a 48-year-old man with previously undiagnosed Wilson disease who presented with parkinsonism and outline the fea-tures on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain， which can support a detailed clinical history and examination to clar-ify the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>.\n\n【38】Case Report\n\n【39】A 48-year-old man self-presented to the Emergency Department with a 3-month history of worsening mobility， falls， dysarthria， and sialorrhea. He was estranged from family， living in squa-lor， and subsisting on a diet of porridge.\n\n【40】His past medical history was relevant for psychotic depres-sion， diagnosed 15 years earlier after a suicide attempt. The first psychotic symptoms appeared at age 30 years at a time when the patient was also using cannabis， amphetamines， and other illicit drugs. He was subsequently diagnosed with schizophrenia， having been hospitalized multiple times with personality changes and further episodes of substance abuse and psychotic episodes. Brain imaging at the time of diagno-sis was not available. He had been commenced on a paliper-idone 100-mg via depot injection 2 years prior to the current presentation. Extrapyramidal features were noted after 18months of paliperidone therapy， thought to be secondary to drug-induced parkinsonism， and the medication was reduced to 75 mg， and then ceased. The patient was not on any other medications at the time of admission.\n\n【41】Examination revealed hypomimia， risus sardonicus， dysarthria(verging on anarthria) and sialorrhea， a stooped posture with shuffling gait， axial rigidity， bradykinesia， and cogwheeling in\n\n【42】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1. Photograph of a Kayser-Fleischer ring (white arrow) visible during slit-lamp examination.</u>\n\n【43】both upper limbs. There was no tremor or dystonic posturing. no frontal release signs， and his eye movements were normal. There were no positive features of schizophrenia， such as hal-lucinations， delusions， or thought disorder， either at presenta-tion or during the admission.\n\n【44】Dedicated ophthalmological examination， requested after ini-tial investigations returned， revealed Kayser-Fleischer rings.\n\n【45】Initial serum testing results， including full blood count， glu-cose， urea， and electrolytes， were normal. Liver function stud-ies were within normal limits， with only GGT mildly raised(57 U/L， reference range， 5-50). Liver synthetic function and iron studies were normal. Serum copper was 4.3pmol/L (ref-erence range， 12.0-22.0)； ceruloplasmin， 0.02 umol/L (refer-ence range， 0.17-0.31)； and 24-h urine copper 2.0umol (refer-ence range，<1.6). Liver ultrasound showed cirrhotic changes， without evidence of portal hypertension. MRI of the brain showed increased FLAIR/T2 signal in the pons， midbrain，and basal ganglia .\n\n【46】The patient's paliperidone was suspended， and he was com-menced on benztropine therapy while awaiting the results of investigations. On confirmation of Wilson disease， chelation therapy with penacillamine and zinc was initiated. Levodopa therapy was added for the marked parkinsonism. At follow-up6 months later， there was mild improvement in his gait and rigidity. At 1 year， however， he had deteriorated； the patient was bedbound with tremor in all 4 limbs， dysarthric， and with severe dysphagia leading to malnutrition， requiring percuta-neous gastrostomy tube insertion.\n\n【47】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2.

Most patients with Wilson disease have a low serum ceruloplasmin level(<0.2 umol/L) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. However， low ceruloplasmin levels can be seen in other disorders， such as malabsorption and acute or chronic hepatitis； conversely， patients with Wilson disease can have elevated ceruloplasmin levels in the presence of acute hepatitis or pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Serum copper levels are usually de-creased proportionally to the reduction in serum ceruloplas-min 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. A low serum ceruloplasmin level， with or without a low serum copper level， should prompt confirmatory testing with a formal ophthalmological examination for the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings and 24-h urinary copper excretion levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>. Kayser-Fleischer rings are due to copper deposi-tion in Descemet's membrane and are seen particularly in pa-tients with neuropsychiatric involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【50】The patient in our case had been mistakenly diagnosed with depression and schizophrenia and treated with standard anti-psychotic medication. The presence of axial rigidity， bradykine-sia， bilateral cogwheeling of the upper limbs， and hypomimia were initially thought to represent drug-induced parkinsonism.\n\n【51】While the most common cause of parkinsonism is idiopath-ic Parkinson disease，drug-induced parkinsonism， central ner-vous system malignancy (glioma， lymphoma)， Huntington disease， mitochondrial disease， Wilson disease， brain iron ac-cumulation， and toxic-metabolic disorders are important dif-ferential diagnoses for early-onset extrapyramidal disorders in a young person 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>. Drug-induced parkinsonism usually ap-pears hours to weeks after starting or increasing antipsychot-ic dosing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>. In our case， symptoms started several months after commencement of paliperidone.\n\n【52】The marked bilateral extrapyramidal features from onset with dysarthria and sialorrhea raised suspicion of an alternative cause to drug-induced parkinsonism. Dysarthria occurs in se-vere parkinsonism from any cause， but the severity of the dys-arthria and sialorrhea was disproportionate to the neuroleptic exposure. In cases in which psychosis precedes parkinson-ism， neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA)，\n\n【53】including neuroferritinopathy， and Wilson disease， should be considered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【54】MRI of the brain can distinguish between NBIA and Wilson disease.

The ideal hospital length of stay is 6-9 days. Management of intestinal obstruction by surgical approach leads to 3 -4 times longer length of stay compared to a conservative approach. Objective. To find out the associated factors of hospital length of stay post laparotomy. Methods： Research data were obtained from medical records of 1 - 12 months old infants who underwent laparotomy in Dr. Soetomo General Hospital from January to December 2018. Data analysis was performed by Fisher’s Exact test. Result： The total subject of 24 patients had a mean 13，4 days length of stay. There were 8 (33，3%) patients with ≤6 days length of stay and 16 (67，7%) with > 6 days length of stay. Nutritional status (p=0，022)， diagnosis(p=0，009)， and the type of laparotomy (p=0，009) are correlated with length of stay. Conclusion： Subjects have a longer length of stay than the recommendation.

The research subjects were obtained from the medical record data of patients in the Inpatient Room for Functional Medical Staff (SMF) Children's Health Sciences Dr. Soetomo Surabaya from January 2018 to December 2018. Sub-jects were infants aged 1-12 months after laparotomy surgery at Dr. Soetomo， who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria with the total sampling method. The inclusion criteria in this study were the medical records of patients aged 1-12 months with code ICD-9-CM 54.1， namely laparotomy surgical procedures during the study period. Exclusion criteria were patients with incomplete medical records. Data were collected from medical records， which included 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> independent variables，namely gen-der， body weight， primary diagnosis， ASA score， preoperative antibiotics， type of surgery， category of surgical wounds， type of laparotomy， stoma making， and oral feeding， and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>) the dependent variable， namely thelength of stay.\n\n【25】The operational limitations are as follows， the classification of nutritional status uses 2006 WHO chart， namely body weight based on age for children aged <2 years. The categories of nutritional status were divided into malnutrition (<-3 SD)， un-dernutrition (-3 SD to <-2 SD)， good nutrition (-2 SD to 2 SD)， and overnutrition (>2 SD). Types of surgery are divided into cito and elective surgery. Surgical wound categories are divided into clean， clean， contaminated， and dirty wounds. There are two types of laparotomy， namely minor laparotomy and major laparotomy. It is called minor laparotomy if there is no bowel resection during the surgical procedure. Major laparotomy is if there is bowel resection with stoma creation or end-to-end anastomosis. Postoperative oral nutrition is said to be early oral feeding if given ≤ 24 hours and late oral feeding if given>24 hours. Length of stay is the number of days the patient is admitted from hospital admission to discharge.\n\n【26】The research analysis used SPSS. The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable was tested using Fisher's exact method. There is a significant re-lationship if the p-value is <0.05. This study was approved by the Health Research Ethics Committee of Dr. Soetomo Surabaya with ethical clearance no. 1483 /KEPK/Ix/2019.\n\n【27】The research subjects were 24 patients who were in the age range of 1-12 months. The mean length of stay in the subjects was 13.4days. A total of 8 (33.3%) subjects underwent hospitalization≤6days and 16 (66.7%) subjects underwent hospitalization> 6 days. The proportion of male to female is 1.7：1. There were 8 (33.3%) malnourished subjects and 16 (66.7%) well-nourished subjects. There were no subjects with less or more nutritional status. The most common diagnosis was intussusception in 15 (62.4%) sub-jects. A total of 4 subjects with a diagnosis of adhesions (2subjects)，wound dehiscence (1 subject)， and intussusception (1subject) had a history of the previous laparotomy.\n\n【28】Two of the 3 subjects who underwent elective surgery were given therapeutic antibiotics. Antibiotic use regimens obtained in this study included cefazoline (15 subjects)， ampicillin (6subjects)， ceftriaxone (2 subjects)， and cefuroxime (1 subject). Nine subjects who underwent bowel resection were included in the category of major laparotomy. In 6 subjects who had a stoma made， 4 subjects had a double-barrel ileostomy， and 2 subjects had loop sigmoidostomy. The distribution of the characteristics of the research subjects is shown in Table 1.\n\n【29】In the results of the bivariate analysis， there was a significant relationship (p <0.05) between the variables of nutritional sta-tus， diagnosis， and type of laparotomy with the variable length of stay . All subjects with poor nutritional status (8subjects)， a diagnosis other than intussusception (9 subjects)， and those undergoing major laparotomy (9 subjects) underwent hospitalization>6 days.\n\n【30】Discussion\n\n【31】Subjects in this study had a longer average hospitalization (13.4days) than the ideal standard of hospitalization (6-9 days)， but shorter than the study by Lakhoo et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> (134 days). The dif-ference in length of stay was due to differences in the diagnosis underlying the laparotomy. There is a relationship between di-agnosis and length of stay (p=0.009).

The study by Foulds et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> stated that gender had little or no effect on length of stay. Nutritional status had a significant relationship with length of stay (p=0.022). This is due to the sig-nificant influence of nutritional status on physiological changes， micronutrient imbalance， and gastrointestinal dysfunction.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> In patients with poor nutrition， the need for protein， fat， and carbohydrates to maintain tissue structure is not fulfilled.\\[15The degree of disease can exacerbate the state of preexisting malnutrition and can be a predisposing factor for complications and prolonged duration of treatment.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>\n\n【38】ASA scores， preoperative antibiotics， and type of surgery did not have a significant relationship in this study. The three vari-ables were more directly related to the presence or absence of surgical wound infection (ILO)， then the length of stay was asso-ciated. Studies by Adamou et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> and Lina et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> stated that ASA IV score and cito surgery have a significant relation-ship with the incidence of ILO， where ILO can increase mortality， affect wound healing， and prolong postoperative hospitaliza-tion. In addition， wound contamination is a factor that increases the risk of the ILO， which is then associated with prolonged hospitalization due to increased morbidity and mortality.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> However， there was no evidence of a significant relationship between surgical wound category and length of stay in this study.\n\n【39】There was a significant relationship between the type of la-parotomy and length of stay (p=0.009). Intestinal resection disrupts the motor activity of the intestine and causes it to be-come paralyzed， thus extending the time to return to bowel function. This is what causes the length of stay in major laparo-tomy is longer than minor laparotomy without bowel resection. Six out of 9 subjects with bowel resection underwent stoma creation， while the rest performed end-to-end anastomosis. Post-resection of bowel stoma did not have a significant relationship with length of stay. According to Hignet et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>， apart from not prolonging hospitalization， stoma making also did not affect the incidence of complications， readmissions， and anastomotic leak.\n\n【40】Early oral feeding was not proven to shorten the length of stay because patients with late oral feeding still received nutri-tion from the nasogastric tube in this study. This study’s result differs from the results of the study by Mamatha et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>， which stated that early oral feeding ≤24 hours postoperatively without waiting for the return of bowel activity can be carried out safely and can reduce the length of stay. The Early Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) guidelines do not recommend that nasogastric tubes remain in place postoperatively as a routine procedure and suggest a gradual increase in feeding at early oral feeding as a stimulant for bowel mobility.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>\n\n【41】Conclusion\n\n【42】Subjects have a longer length of stay than the recommendation.

Objective： To analyze the relationships between the mandibular foramen and mandible anatomical points. Materials and methods： 60 dry jaws of cadavers were used in anatomical laboratories in Parafba， Brazil. The analyzed variables were measured using a digital calliper. The Kolmogorov Smirnoff test was applied to analyze the normality of the data， and then the means of the variables were compared through the t-test. Results： For most variables there was variation between the sexes and sides， except for the width of the mandibular foramen， presenting the difference between the sides of the same sex and there was no variation at the point of major depression. Conclusion： The findings of this study revealed differences in the location of MF between men and women， which differs from most studies. These findings provide useful information for surgical applicability， anaesthetic blocking procedures， and reconstructive.\n\n【6】KEYWORDS Jaw， mandibular foramen， morphometry， prognathism， retrognathism\n\n【7】Introduction\n\n【8】The mandible is a closed V-shaped folded tubular bone， formed by two branches interconnected to its body， whose intersection forms the mandibular angles (Standring 2010).

Each of the branches presents a coronoid process， mandibular notch， and a condylar process， also known as mandible condyle，that fits the mandibular fossa of the temporal bone， along with the articular capsule， forming the temporomandibular joint (Madeira 2010).\n\n【13】The mandibular foramen (MF) lies on the inner side of the mandible branch， about 1 cm above the mandibular molar teeth occlusal plane (Marzola et al. 2004)， near the pterygomandibular space central point (Arx and Lozanoff 2016). This structure is protected anteriorly by the lingula， a bone spicule that acts as the inferior insertion of the sphenomandibular ligament point(Standring 2010). At the entrance of MF is the sulcus collis， a longitudinal depression located anteroinferior to the condylar process. The endocoronoid ridge extends from the lingula and\n\n【14】anterior border of the mandibular foramen to the mandible in-cisal (Khoury et al. 2011， Arx and Lozanoff 2016). In a systematic review， it was observed that the mean MF size in adults ranged from 4 to 5 mm. Also， there was a difference in the MF diameter related to the age (deciduous and permanent teeth) (Arx and Lozanoff 2016).\n\n【15】The MF is the entry point for the mandibular canal， through which the inferior alveolar neurovascular bundle penetrates in the mandibular tooth roots. The mandibular canal crosses the entire mandible from its respective entrance side to the anterior part， forming the mental foramen， the exit point of the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN)， one of the mandibular nerve branches(Andrade 2015).\n\n【16】The MF is an important anatomical reference point for the planning of mandibular surgical interventions， such as sagittal osteotomy for repositioning the mandible in prognathism and retrognathism， reducing the risk of fractures and necrosis of this region during surgery (Lima et al. 2011， Sakshi and Puneet2018). Also， MF evaluation is of considerable importance for the blockade of IAN， a local anaesthetic technique commonly used in dental practice. However， even when an appropriate technique is applied， the prevalence of IAN block failure may vary from 30 to 45% of cases (Hafez 2017). The failures associated with this procedure， and the consequent risk of neural damage， seem to be related to the inaccurate location of MF (Sakshi and Puneet 2018)， with variation in its position about the mandible branch dimensions (Khan and Ansari 2016).\n\n【17】Trost et al. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2010)</u> based on the evaluation of panoramic ra-diographs concluded that the anterior and lower thirds of the mandible branch are the most likely places to find MF in adults， with the posterior and superior thirds being a safe zone for pro-cedures in the mandible branch， with low probability of inferior alveolar neurovascular injury. Given the above， the importance of adequate knowledge of the MF anatomy and contiguous struc-tures in the planning of the surgical procedure is emphasized as well as the application of anaesthetic and vasopressor agents during mandibular block anaesthesia (Khoury et al. 2010).\n\n【18】Also， knowledge of the MF dimensions as well as variations in its relative position to the mandible branch can be useful in the radiological study of this region. Thus， the objective of the present study was to analyze the mandibular foramen morphom-etry and its relation with the mandible branch anatomical points， comparing the measurements between right and left sides and male and female genders.\n\n【19】Materials and Methods\n\n【20】The study used 60 dry human skull jaws from anatomy labora-tories in Parafba- Brazil. Deformed， broken or damaged jaws that could influence measurements and results were excluded. and only jaws in good condition were studied， photographed and dimensioned.\n\n【21】The mandibles dimorphism was evaluated through four points： mental protuberance， mandibular condyles， mandibular angle and posterior border of the branch. Men’s mental bulge is usually broader and square， while in women， they are thin-ner and sharper. The mandibular condyles in males tend to be more robust， while females are thinner. Men tend to have a mandibular angle closer to 90°， while women have their angles more rounded， forming itself a little higher than in men. The posterior branch border is straight (without angulations) in most of the female individuals， whereas in men there is a distinctive angulation at the posterior border of the mandibular branch.\n\n【22】The present research was carried out in March and April 2019. A digital carbon fibre calliper (Nove54) was used for the mor-phometric analysis and respective measurements： mandibular foramen width， distance between the mandibular foramen to the point of greatest distance between the mandibular foramen and the angle of the mandibular foramen， the distance between the mandibular foramen to the point of major depression in the lower border of the branch， the distance between the mandibu-lar foramen and the point of major depression in the upper border of the branch (mandibular notch) and distance between the mandibular foramen to the point of major depression at the anterior border of the branch， measurements made on both sides. Regarding the measurement of the mandibular fora-men width， the rebound face measurement and other analyzes were used through the nozzles for external measurement so that the LCD would show the measurement accurately.\n\n【23】To test the distribution of numerical variables normality， the Kolmogorov Smirnoff test was used. When a normal distribu-tion was found， the descriptive data were presented as mean and standard deviation， minimum and maximum values. The t-test for independent samples was used to compare the morpho-metric data of MF related to gender and mandible sides. In all analyzes a 95% confidence interval (95%CI) and a statistical sig-nificance of p <0.05 were considered. Statistical information was obtained using the statistical application Prism v 5.0(GraphPad Software， San Diego，CA).\n\n【24】Results\n\n【25】Sixty skulls were evaluated. The MF morphometric analysis about the right and left antimer and between male and female are shown in table 1. It was observed that the LFM diameter varied in the right side between 3.7 and 7.8 mm and 3.38 to 6.6mm for the left side in males， with a mean of 5.4±1.04 mm and4.8±0.98 mm， respectively. = 0.0071). Regarding the female gender， MF width ranged from 3.5 to 8.3 mm on the right and3.09 to 8.8 mm on the left， with a mean of 5.66±1.25 mm and 4.8±1.34 mm， respectively， also showing significant differences (p=0.0397). There was no significant difference between the FM widths about the same antimer in both sexes.\n\n【26】The distance between the mandibular foramen to the pogo-nion (DFGo) in males ranged from 13.56 to 30.3 mm on the right， with a mean of 22.3 ±4 mm and 12.94 to 30.8 mm on the left. with a mean of 22 ± 4.2 mm， with no significant difference (p=0.7628). In females DFG was found， ranging from 13.89 to 24.8mm on the right side， with a mean of 19.02± 2.6 mm and 11.29to 26.21 mm on the left side， with a mean of 18.08 ±3.8 mm， non-significant differences (p=0，9691). However， there were important differences for the same antimer between genders， right (p=0.0008) and left (p=0.0065).\n\n【27】The distance from the mandibular foramen to the point of major depression at the anterior border of the branch (DFAR) in men ranged from 10.14 to 22.4 mm on the right with a mean of16.19±3.25 mm and 9.64 at 22.4 mm on the left， with a mean of16.35±3.23 mm， but without significant difference (p=0.8264). In women， DFAR ranged from 7.88 to 19.5 mm on the right， with a mean of 14.04±2.9 mm and 7.76 to 19 mm， and the left with a mean of 14.2± 6.65 mm， also with no significant difference (p=0.8376). However， important differences were observed for the same antimer between genders on the right (p=0.0113) and left(p=0.0089).\n\n【28】The mandibular foramen distance to the point of major de-pression at the posterior border of the branch (DFPR) ranged\n\n【29】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

In females， DFPD ranged from 7.4 to 14.1 mm on the right side and 7.6 to 16.06 mm on the left side， with averages of 10.39±1.67 mm and 10.54±2.41， respectively， also without significant differences (p=0.7993). However， it was observed that in the right antimer， between the genders， there was a significant difference (p=0.0353) among the measurements of the DFPR.\n\n【31】The information obtained from the distance of the mandibu-lar foramen to the point of major depression at the upper border of the branch (DFSR) exposed the absence of significant varia-tion in the same gender and between them. In men， this measure ranged from 10.9 to 27.1 mm， with a mean of 19.19±3.75mm on the right and 10.8 to 29.6 mm， with a mean (19.19±3.75)on the left， with no significant differences. The DFSR ranged from11.1 to 26 mm with a mean of 19.83±3.67 mm on the right and3.7-24.6 mm on the left， with no significant differences. There\n\n【32】were no significant differences between the same antimers in both genders.\n\n【33】The results obtained from the distance of the mandibular foramen to the point of most significant depression in the inferior border of the branch (DFIR) revealed that these measurements in males ranged from 20 to 36 mm on the right and 19.4 to 37.4 mm on the left， with respective mean values of 27.7 ± 3.6 mm and27.56± 4.28， without significant differences. In females， DFIR length variation was found between 17.91 and 29.85 mm on the right and 18.98 mm on the left， presenting a mean of 23.97±3.02mm and 24.81±3.25 mm respectively， also without significant differences (p=0.3591). When comparing the DFIR averages for the same antimer between genders， it was observed that male mandibles were significantly larger when compared to female ones.\n\n【34】Discussion\n\n【35】The literature is scarce regarding mandible morphometric data， especially the MF. It is even more scarce about the comparison\n\n| VARIABLES  | MALE  |  | FEMALE Vmin-Mean ±SD P-value Vmax  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| VARIABLES  | Vmin-  | Mean十  | FEMALE Vmin-Mean ±SD P-value Vmax  |  |  |\n| VARIABLES  | Vmax  | SD  | FEMALE Vmin-Mean ±SD P-value Vmax  |  |  |\n| LFM  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Right  | 3.7-7.8  | 5.4±1.04  | 3.5-8.3  | 5.66±1.25  | 0，5047  |\n| Left  | 3.38-6.6  | 4.8±0.98  | 3.09-8.8  | 4.8±1.34  | 0，8212  |\n| P-value  |  | 0.0071\\  |  | 0.0397\\  |  |\n| DFGo  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Right  | 13.56-30.3  | 22.3±4  | 13.89-24.8  | 19.02±2.6  | 0，0008\\  |\n| Left  | 12.94-30.8  | 22±4.2  | 11.29-26.21  | 18.98±3.8  | 0，0065\\  |\n| P-value  |  | 0.7628  |  | 0.9691  |  |\n| DFAR  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Right  | 10.14-22.4  | 16.19±3.25  | 7.88-19.5  | 14.04±2.9  | 0，0113\\  |\n| Left  | 9.64-22.4  | 16.35±3.23  | 7.76-19  | 14.2±6.65  | 0，0089\\  |\n| P-value  |  | 0.8264  |  | 0.8376  |  |\n| DFPR  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Right  | 6.6-14.5  | 11.4±1.84  | 7.4-14.1  | 10.39±1.67  | 0，0353\\  |\n| Left  | 7.6-14.7  | 11.27±1.8  | 7.6-16.06  | 10.54±2.41  | 0，1873  |\n| P-value  |  | 0.7727  |  | 0.7993  |  |\n| DFSR  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Right  | 10.9-27.1  | 19.19±3.75  | 11.1-26  | 19.83±3.67  | 0，5160  |\n| Left  | 10.8-29.6  | 19.05±3.98  | 3.7-24.6  | 18.74±4.6  | 0，7855  |\n| P-value  |  | 0.8765  |  | 0.3698  |  |\n| DFIR  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Right  | 20-36  | 27.7±3.6  | 17.91-29.85  | 23.97±3.02  | P<0.0001\\  |\n| Left  | 19.4-37.4  | 27.56±4.28  | 18.98-29.6  | 24.81±3.25  | 0，0098\\  |\n| P-value  |  | 0.8799  |  | 0.3591  |  |\n\n【37】of dimorphic morphometric data between adult mandibles. This work aimed to accurately analyze the MF morphometric data in human dry jaws comparing the means obtained about the right and left antimeres within the same gender and for the same antimer between male and female.\n\n【38】Initially， LFM was measured. It was found that the LFM of the male mandibles were， on average， significantly more signifi-cant on the right side (5.40 mm) when compared to the left side(4.80 mm)， as well as on female where the right side (5.66 mm) was also significantly more significant than the left side (4.80mm). There were no significant differences between the same antimeres of both genders. Lima et al. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2011)</u> assessed 38 adult dry mandibles and also found significantly higher mean LFM values for the right side (5.87 mm) when compared to the left side (5.73 mm) in the same gender. Therefore， it is perceived that there is a tendency to find a larger right LFM in the same indi-vidual， provoking different tolerance limits for the useful areas for anaesthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve in oral procedures. For Khoury et al. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2010)</u>， the different LFM patterns in the same individual increase the uncertainty about whether the needle is sufficiently close to the inferior alveolar nerve to achieve local anaesthesia， increasing the risk of iatrogenic lesions.\n\n【39】The distance between the mandibular foramen to the pogo nion (DFGo) was analyzed， and a significant variation was ob-served between antimeres of both genders， the male’s right side of the jaw measured 22.3 mm and the left 22 mm while in fe-males the jaws right side measured 19.02 mm and left 18.98 mm. However， when compared in the same gender， there was no sig-nificant statistical difference. Mello 通用删除7(英):<u>(2016)</u> observed 20.76 mm on the right side and 20.72 mm on the left side， with a mean value approaching the data found in this study for females. Minatel et al. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2008)</u>， analyzed 100 dry human jaws， found a mean DFGo of22.3 mm for the right antimer and 22.56 mm for the left antimer without significant differences.\n\n【40】When analyzing the distance of the mandibular foramen to the point of major depression in the anterior border of the branch(DFAR)， a mean distance of 16.19 mm on the right side and 16.35 mm on the left side was observed in males， while in the female jaws the mean distance was 14.04 mm in the right antimer and 14.20 mm in the left. Thus， it is observed that DFAR is significantly higher in male jaws when compared to female jaws in both antimers. There were no significant differences in DFAR between the same gender antimer. In the studies of Lima et al. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2011)</u>， the averages presented were 19.48 mm on the right side and 19.96 mm on the left. Sakshi and Puneet 通用删除7(英):<u>(2018)</u> stated that the reason for this difference might be due to regional and bioecological factors.\n\n【41】The mean distance from the mandibular foramen to the point of major depression at the posterior border of the branch (DFPR) was evaluated in males， who presented 11.40 mm for the right side and 11.27 mm for the left side， as for female， 10.39 mm right and 10.54 mm on the left， with statistically significant differences between the genders only on the right side and no difference when compared to the same gender. Padmavathi 通用删除7(英):<u>(2014)</u>， who evaluated 65 adult human jaws， found an average of 11.7 mm on the right and 12.1 mm on the left， showing no significant differences. Trost et al.通用删除7(英):<u>(2010)</u> state that the location of MF does not change significantly between genders， which did not occur in this study. Here there was a significant difference between the anatomical positions of the right MF of male and female jaws.\n\n【42】Analyzing the results of the MF position about the mandible branch， from the results presented by DFAR and DFPR， it is\n\n【43】noted that the MF position is closer to the posterior margin than to the anterior margin of the mandible. These findings differ from the ones from other authors who concluded that MF is located at the centre of the mandibular branch，i.e.， being equidistant between the anterior and posterior margins of the mandible (Marzola et al. 2004， Strini et al. 2006).\n\n【44】When analyzing the distance from the mandibular foramen to the point of major depression in the upper border of the branch (DFSR)， the average in males is 19.19 mm on the right side and 19.05 mm on the left side， just as in females it is 19.83mm on the right and 18.74 mm to the left， of which there were no statistically significant changes. The research of Lima et al.通用删除7(英):<u>(2011)</u> shows average values of 27.7 mm and 27.32 mm on the right and left sides， respectively， showing measures significantly higher than those identified in the present study. Prado et al. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2010)</u> performed a study with 80 toothed jaws and 79 edentates， with no gender knowledge， and the average found in the dentate and edentulous on the right side was 24 mm and 23 mm on the left and the same dentate on the right， also presenting measurements larger than our study. DFSR is a useful parameter in clinical practice， allowing that， from the mandible notch， the anatomical position of MF can belocated. For Mendoza et al.通用删除7(英):<u>(2004)</u>， in the case of horizontal osteotomies， there should be a safety margin of 13 mm from the midpoint of the mandibular incision to avoid MF area and consequently surgical complications， our findings allow us to accept this distance as a safety margin.\n\n【45】Measurements of mandibular foramen distance to the point of major depression at the lower border of the branch (DFIR) showed essential variations in both genders sides， the mean of males was 27.7 mm to the right and 26.56 mm to the left and the females 23.97 mm and 24.81 mm， respectively， revealing that there are no differences between the same gender antimeres， however， DFIR measurements， whether on the right or left side， are significantly higher in males than the same measurements found in the female mandibles. In the studies by Oguz and Bozkir 通用删除7(英):<u>(2002)</u>， the means of the DFIR presented 30.97 mm to the right and 29.75 mm to the left， being larger than the data of this same variable of the present study.\n\n【46】Conclusion\n\n【47】In this study， significant differences were found in the mandibu-lar foramen location between the male and female genders. These findings differ from most studies involving mandible mor-phometry that suggest that gender and age do not interfere with the MF position. Our findings are essential to guide surgeons working in northeastern Brazil， since， although we had a rela-tively small sample， there are indications that the MF position differs between genders in our region， which requires the atten-tion of the health professionals who act on buccomaxillofacial procedures involving the mandibular branch area. Therefore， this study offers useful information for surgical applicability， anaesthetic block procedures， measurements for reconstructive procedures， as well as to expose significant variations when compared to jaws in other regions， whether they are close or not.\n\n【48】Competing Interests\n\n【49】There were no financial support or relationships between the authors and any organization or professional bodies that could pose any conflict of interests.\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>References</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

The most common cause is osteo-degenerative changes in the cartilage and/or joint sys-tem. Metastatic calcification is a rare and initially often overlooked cause of persistent， therapy-resistant pain of connective tissues and joint apparatus in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on dialysis therapy. These calcifications are induced by persistent hyperphosphatemia/hyperparathyroidism and can occur in various or-gans， including joints， tendons， heart valves， soft tissues， and blood vessels.\n\n【27】Case Report： We report on a 46-year-old male patient with ESRD due to cANCA-associated systemic vasculitis. The patient evolved unfavorably to end-stage renal failure and started continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Four years after initiation of CAPD， the patient reported having painful motion of the left shoulder， and symp-tomatic physiotherapy and non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs (NSAIDs) were prescribed. An X-ray exami-nation of the left shoulder showed severe periarticular calcifications. Repeated nutritional counselling was of-fered， and intensive phosphate-binder therapy was administered， resulting in a reduction in phosphate levels from 2.10 mmol at the time of diagnosis to 1.26 mmol/l 16 months later. Radiological reevaluation showed a near complete resolution of the periarticular calcifications.\n\n【28】Conclusions： Metastatic calcifications may arise in ESRD patients despite only moderately elevated blood phosphate levels. Intensive measures to reduce the phosphate load to normal levels should be implemented and can lead to al-most complete resolution of ectopic calcifications in affected patients.\n\n【29】Keywords：\n\n【30】Calcification of Joints and Arteries· Dialysis·Hyperphosphatemia·Peritoneal Dialysis， Continuous Ambulatory· Shoulder Dystocia· Shoulder Pain\n\n【31】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/933223\n\n【32】As a result of decreased renal phosphate excretion due to re-duced nephron mass， severe hyperphosphatemia can arise in patients with end-stage renal disease. Therefore， all such pa tients routinely receive specialized nutritional counselling to reduce the daily phosphate load， mainly due to intake of dairy products or processed food. Additionally， oral phosphate bind-ers are prescribed to reduce gastrointestinal phosphate up-take. In ESRD patients with sustained hyperphosphatemia， metastatic calcifications can occur in various organs， includ-ing joints， tendons， heart valves， and blood vessels， necessi-tating strict measures to reduce the blood phosphate levels.\n\n【33】Case Report\n\n【34】A 46-year-old male patient had ESRD due to cANCA-associat-ed systemic vasculitis with rapid-progressive glomerulonephri-tis. Despite intensive immunomodulatory therapy with plasma-pheresis，steroid boluses， and cyclophosphamide， renal failure developed and the patient was started on continuous ambu-latory peritoneal dialysis. Over time， residual kidney function declined and phosphate levels rose from 1.07 to about 1.20mmol/l at the time of radiologic examination. Four years af-ter initiation of CAPD， the patient reported having painful mo-tion of the left shoulder， and symptomatic physiotherapy and NSAIDs were prescribed. Continuing pain prompted an X-ray examination of the left shoulder， showing severe ectopic or metastatic periarticular calcifications . At the time of diagnosis， the following laboratory values were remarkable：calcium 2.38 mmol/L， phosphate 2.10 mmol/L， and parathy-roid hormone 283 ng/L Secondary hyperparathyroidism was controlled with oral calcidiol therapy 10 000 IU per week and25-0H-D3 levels were 36 nmol/l at the time of diagnoses， but1-25-0H-D3 levels were not checked. Nevertheless， the pa-tient was not receiving active vitamin D3 therapy. The patient was offered repeated nutritional counselling， and phosphate-binder therapy was intensified using different combinations of phosphate binders， including lanthanum-carbonate， calci-um-acetate and magnesium-carbonate， and sevelamer-carbon-ate. This was done to find the most effective regimen， as the patient reported adverse effects as nausea， constipation， and abdominal pain when maximum dosages of single phosphate binders were prescribed. In addition to supportive pain medi-cation and physiotherapy， he was seen by an orthopedic spe-cialist， but invasive therapies such as local injections of anes-thetics were not performed. The estimated glomerular filtration rate approximated less than 5 ml/min/1.73 m² BSA and the patient was switched to 3-times-weekly hemodialysis due to repeated volume overload with hypertension despite a weekly Kt/V of 1.71 on CAPD. The dialysis regimen prescribed consist-ed of 3-times-weekly sessions， each 270 min long， resulting in\n\n【35】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

A 46-year-old male patient with ESRD after sustained lowering of phosphate levels to normal levels.

The procedure was performed using post-dilu-tional online hemodiafiltration with a mean volume of 12-16liters. This regimen， most presumably the switch to hemodial-ysis， resulted in a marked decrease in phosphate levels， which were controlled thereafter at normal ranges with a mean val-ue of 1.26 mmol/L Calcium and parathyroid hormone levels remained stable over time， at 2.29 mmol/L and 255 ng/l，re-spectively. Over the following 16 months， the symptoms grad-ually improved and finally resolved completely. Radiological reevaluation showed nearly complete resolution of the peri-articular calcifications .\n\n【38】Soft-tissue calcifications in uremic patients can occur in sev-eral different anatomical locations， including arterial， ocular， subcutaneous， valvula， visceral， and periarticular 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. It is postulated that this disease entity is associated with an in-crease calcium-phosphate-product and elevated PTH levels in ESRD patients. The reason for the preponderance of cer-tain anatomical regions over others in different patients is still unclear， but the syndrome can lead to disastrous conse-quences， including paraparesis， if detected late in the course and not treated adequately 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Calcifications can arise rap-idly within several months， such that negative radiological evaluations in the past medical history cannot reliably rule out de novo ectopic deposition of calcium deposits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In ex-tremely rare cases， ectopic tumoral calcinosis has been de-scribed in multiple distinct locations in the same patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> and concomitantly with calciphylaxis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.Nevertheless， in con-trast to calciphylaxis， ectopic calcifications are not associat-ed with warfarin therapy. Few ESRD patients develop ectopic calcification， and this might be due to be a complex interplay of metabolic interactions predisposing certain individuals to this process. Most cases of metastatic calcifications are de-scribed in individuals with very high parathyroid hormone lev-els 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In this regard，the case presented here differs in that the patient showed only moderately elevated phosphate lev-els and normal calcium and PTH levels within recommend-ed target ranges， suggesting other relevant pathophysiologi-cal mechanisms. Although high phosphate levels seem to be more associated with ectopic calcifications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>，lower levels of2.48 to 2.07 mmol/l have also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>. One expla-nation might be a possible reduced appetite due to chronic pain or adverse effects of pain medication in these patients. We could not detect any predisposing factors to develop ec-topic calcifications， such as prior trauma or surgical proce-dures， in our patient. Besides these parameters， novel mod-els assume that alterations of vascular smooth muscle cells can have an additive effect in this distinct disorder. Cell cul-tures of smooth muscle cells can be induced to mineralize by elevating the phosphate levels within the culture milieu 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>， thereby adding an active process on the cellular level to the simple model of mineral ion oversaturation and precipitation. Further research has shed some light on a complex interplay of different factors as inducers or inhibitors of the calcification\n\n【39】References：\n\n【40】1\\. Oxlund CS， Hansen H， Hansen S，Rohold A.

The basic approaches used to treat hy-perphosphatemia in ESRD patients are changes and/or ad-aptations in lifestyle and diet followed by the prescription of phosphate binders as tolerated. Furthermore， these mea-sures are not only important in reducing the risk for ectopic calcifications， but also in improving the known high cardio-vascular mortality risk in these vulnerable patients. Giventhe potential catastrophic consequences of this disorder， inten-sifying the ESRD regimen by switching， as in this case， from CAPD to HD or even emergent transplant might be justified. Nevertheless， this case also demonstrates the overall benefit of simple dietary and medicinal measures， such as increasing the dose of phosphate binders and switching to hemodialy-sis， in the treatment armamentarium of metastatic calcifica-tions. Therapeutically， such conservative non-operative mea-sures are preferred over operative procedures， as these might lead to non-healing wounds with increased risk of infections.\n\n【44】Conclusions\n\n【45】Metastatic or ectopic calcifications can arise in ESRD patients despite only moderately elevated blood phosphate levels. In cas-es with unexplained symptoms， metastatic calcifications should be considered as a differential diagnosis， even in patients with moderately elevated blood phosphate levels. Intensive mea-sures to reduce the phosphate load to normal levels should be implemented. These measures may include switching to more intensive ESRD treatment regimens， repeated dietary counsel-ling， high-dose phosphate-binder therapy， and， ultimately， renal transplantation. Importantly， operative measures or surgical re-section of the calcified tissues should be postponed if possible.\n\n【46】Declaration of Figures' Authenticity\n\n【47】All figures submitted have been created by the authors， who confirm that the images are original with no duplication and have not been previously published in whole or in part.\n\n【48】4\\.

Instances where diversion occurs leads to complications such as pleural effusion. A rare complication of lymphatic diversion results in fluid accumulation in the bronchial tree， causing plastic bronchitis. The following case is the first ever report of plastic bronchitis presenting with pneumopericardium.\n\n【24】Case Report： A 24-year-old female presented to our Emergency Department with an asthma exacerbation. After initiating\n\n【25】bronchodilators， a chest radiograph (CXR) showed extensive subcutaneous emphysema， pneumomediastinum， and pneumothorax with atelectasis of the left lung. Chest tomography supported the CXR findings， as well as a finding of pneumopericardium. A thoracostomy tube was placed and a mediastinal window and pericardial window procedure were performed in an attempt to relieve the pressure upon the collapsed lung. Despite these invasive procedures， there was minimal improvement of lung volume with further respiratory deterioration； the patient eventually required mechanical ventilation. Bronchoscopy was performed， which evacuated a white chalky and rubbery substance that created a mold of the bronchial airways. Following the bronchoscopy， the patient's respiratory status improved， requiring less ventilator support， and that patient was successfully\n\n【26】extubated.\n\n【27】Conclusions： This case highlights the most crucial management of a patient presenting with pneumomediastinum， pneumo-thorax， and pneumopericardium due to plastic bronchitis. Plastic bronchitis should be high on the list of dif-ferential diagnoses. The management of plastic bronchitis with bronchoscopy is supported by the fact that no invasive therapy such as thoracostomy tube or mechanical ventilator alleviated the problem， however， bron-choscopy removed the worm-like cast lodged within the lumen of the bronchial tree.\n\n【28】MeSH Keywords： Bronchitis · Bronchoscopy· Pneumopericardium\n\n【29】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/911311\n\n【30】Lymphatic circulation in the thorax traverses from the lymphatic system to the subclavian vein， returning into systemic circula-tion.

Instances where the drainage is diverted leads to complications such as pleural effusion， or even more rarely， bronchitis within the spectrum of pulmonary lymphatic perfusion syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Patients prone to diversion of lymph fluid are those with congenital cardiac anomalies or pulmonary diseases such as asthma. Plastic bronchitis is a rare disorder in which the lymphatic fluid collects in the bron-chial airway forming a rubbery substance obstructing airflow characterized by large， rigid airway plugs， often more cohe-sive than ordinary mucus plugs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In a large university center， researchers discovered 14 cases in a pool of over 205 000 pa-tients， portraying the rarity of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. We present the first ever reported case of plastic bronchitis in a patient who was found to have a pneumopericardium.\n\n【31】Case Report\n\n【32】This is a case of a 24-year-old previously healthy female pre-senting to the hospital with complaints of shortness of breath with neck fullness that acutely worsened prior to arrival. She began feeling ill approximately 1 week prior to her visit， with upper respiratory tract infection with occasional chest tight-ness. In the Emergency Department， a chest radiograph showed extensive pneumomediastinum，pneumothorax， and subcuta-neous emphysema. Follow-up chest tomography confirmed the pneumomediastinum， emphysema， as well as pneumopericar-dium . The patient received a chest tube， and peri-cardial window and mediastinal window procedures. Despite chest tube placement， the left upper and lower lobes remained collapsed. Fiber optic bronchoscopy was performed which re-vealed extensive bilateral mucous plugging with findings de-scribed as plastic worm-like substance following the tracks of the airway mostly in the left upper lobe， left lower lobe， and right upper lobe .\n\n【33】Discussion\n\n【34】Mucosal or alveolar capillary barrier injury causes cast for-mation by protein-rich material， and endobronchial lymph or exudative airway inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.

This report is of 2 cases of coronary artery perforation during percutaneous coronary intervention that were managed successfully using injection of combined Histoacryl (n-Butyl-2-Cyanoacrylate) and Lipiodol(ethiodized oil).\n\n【25】Case Reports：\n\n【26】Conclusions：\n\n【27】Case 1 was a 51-year-old man with a past medical history of hypertension， dyslipidemia， and multivessel coro-nary disease. He was admitted to our hospital with inferior wall myocardial infarction， and a stent was placed in the proximal right coronary artery. He also had chronic total occlusion (CTO) of the left anterior descend-ing artery (LAD). The planned LAD CTO intervention was complicated by balloon-induced coronary perforation and was managed successfully with intracoronary injection of Histoacryl-Lipiodol mixtures via microcatheter. He was discharged in stable condition without any serious consequences. Case 2 was a 72-year-old man with underlying hypertension who was admitted to the hospital with diagnosis of unstable angina. The diagnostic angiography showed occlusion of the LAD， CTO of the left circumflex artery， and minor atherosclerosis in right coronary artery. A stent was placed in the mid-LAD without any complications. Subsequently， a planned left circumflex artery CTO intervention was complicated by wire-induced coronary perforation， which was treated successfully with injection of Histoacryl-Lipiodol mixture. The patient was discharged in good condition. Histoacryl and Lipiodol injection was a rapid and effective management method in 2 rare cases of coronary ar-tery perforation during percutaneous coronary intervention.\n\n【28】Keywords： Angioplasty， Balloon， Coronary·Enbucrilate· Ethiodized Oil\n\n【29】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/938861\n\n【30】Publisher's note： All daims expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of their affiliated\n\n【31】AP\n\n【32】organizations， or those of the publisher the editors and the reviewers. Any product that may be evaluated in this article， or claim that may be made by its manufacturer， is not guaranteed or endorsed by the publisher\n\n【33】Coronary artery perforation is one of the most severe compli-cations of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Between1993 and 2001， a reported series of >10 000 PCls included 6836cases that required stenting， with coronary artery perforation in 0.84% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The incidence of coronary artery per-foration is higher (4-9%) in chronic total occlusion (CTO) PCI owing to the higher complexity of these lesions and the tech-niques used to recanalize them 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. According to the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society database， the risk of per-foration was significantly higher in CTO PCI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【34】According to the Ellis classification， type l coronary artery per-foration is defined as an extraluminal crater without extrav-asation； type ll is myocardial or pericardial blushing without contrast extravasation； type Illa is defined as clear perfora-tion (>1 mm) with evidence of extravasation； and type Illb is defined as perforations into the left ventricle， coronary sinus， or another anatomic circulatory chamber 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Mild coronary artery perforation (type l and type ll) is considered to have a better outcome and can be conservatively managed， with most patients undergoing prolonged balloon inflation alone. For more severe cases (typeIll)， the in-hospital mortality rate is very high (15.2%)， and these patients require urgent treat-ment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Treatment includes covered stents， coils， micro-spheres， or other methods， such as autologous blood clots， thrombin， and fat injection.\n\n【35】The first-line treatment is covered stents， especially in proxi-mal larger perforations； however， this treatment requires ex-pertise and time. Microspheres， including Histoacry! (n-Butyl-2-Cyanoacrylate； B. Braun Medical Ltd， Melsungen，Germany) and Lipiodol (ethiodized oil) mixtures typically can be used for distal sites of coronary artery perforation； the mixtures are de-livered through microcatheters and cause precise sealing of perforations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The advantages are an uncomplicated tech-nique， low cost， and wide availability in many hospitals. This report is of 2 cases of coronary artery perforation during PCI managed successfully using injection of combined Histoacry.(n-Butyl-2-Cyanoacrylate) and Lipiodol (ethiodized oil).\n\n【36】Case Reports\n\n【37】Case 1\n\n【38】A 51-year-old man with a past medical history of hypertension， dyslipidemia， and multivessel coronary artery disease present-ed to our hospital. One month earlier， he was diagnosed with ST-elevated myocardialinfarction (STEMI). Diagnostic coronary angiography showed severe stenosis of the right coronary ar-tery (RCA) and CTO of the mid-left anterior descending artery\n\n【39】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

Revascularization was done with 1 stent placed in the mid-RCA， and the patient was discharged with an optimal dose of statin， duo-antiplate-let therapy， and beta-blocker. After the event， he continued to experience angina symptoms， associated with shortness of breath， which interfered with his daily activity and quali-ty of life， leading him back to the hospital. An electrocardio-gram show fixed T-wave inversion in DII， DIII， and aVF， similar to 1 month before. Laboratory tests were done，and the ba-sic metabolic panel results were in the reference range.

An echocardiogram showed left ventricular dilation with hypokinesia of the posterior wall and interventricular septum. The ejection fraction was 41%. Moderate anterior ischemia was detected in the myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computerized tomography(SPECT) scan. The patient was evaluated by the Heart Team and was found to have the indication for CTO revasculariza-tion to improve symptoms and to reduce the risk of death or MI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. After discussing interventional and surgical revascu-larization with the patient， we decided to do PCI to the CTO of the left anterior descending artery (LAD)， owing to the pa-tient's preference.\n\n【47】The procedure was done via radial access with a 6F guid-ing catheter (Launcher， Medtronic)； run-through guidewire with balloon support was passed through the lesion. Because there was no collateral from the other vessels， we could not check the distal vessel of the LAD. We used a small balloon1.5×15 NC Emerge (Boston Scientific) to dilate， and then in-creased it to 2.5×15， with pressure to 20 atmospheres of pressure. After a few balloon inflations， the contrast injec-tion showed a type 3 perforation . The bal-loon was deployed immediately to stop bleeding， and after30 min， the patient was stable， although he still had a sign of bleeding. We decided to put a microcatheter (Corsair， Asahi)\n\n【48】to inject 3 mL of Histoacryl-Lipiodol mixture， with a ratio 1：3， into the distal LAD . Immediately， the bleeding stopped . During the procedure， the pa-tient remained asymptomatic， and his vital signs were within normal limits. A serial echocardiogram showed no significant pericardial effusion. The patient was discharged after 5 days.\n\n【49】Case 2\n\n【50】A 72-year-old man with underlying hypertension presented to our hospital with chest pain and was diagnosed with unstable angina. A coronary angiogram showed severe stenosis of the LAD， CTO of the left circumflex artery (LCx) ， and minor atherosclerosis in the RCA. After revascularization of the LAD with 1 stent， he was discharged with an optimal dose of anti-platelet therapy，statin，and beta-blocker. The following month， he continued to have significant angina with daily activities that reduced his quality of life， even with good medication adher-ence. He was admitted for further investigation. His electrocar-diogram was normal except for left axis deviation. Laboratory test results showed basic metabolic panel results in the refer-ence range and a troponin T level of 41 pg/mL (reference range，14 pg/mL). The echocardiogram showed apical and lateral hy-pokinesia， with an ejection fraction of 45%. Dobutamine stress echocardiography revealed lateral ischemia. According to the2021 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines， in patients being considered for coronary revascu-larization for whom the optimal treatment strategy is unclear， a multidisciplinary Heart Team approach is recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. This patient consulted with the Heart Team， the surgical option was excluded owing to the patient's preference， and we decid-ed to do percutaneous revascularization of the CTO of the LCx.\n\n【51】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5.

A run-through guidewire in a microcatheter (Corsair， Asahi) was used to cross the lesion. However， the lesions were calcified. After a few wire manipulations， we observed an LCx small branch perforation with bleeding to the epicardial space. Microcatheter corsair can stop bleeding but is unstable ； therefore， we decided to inject 2 mL of Histoacryl-Lipiodol mixture (ratio 1：3) through the micro-catheter into the false lumen， and after several seconds， the\n\n【55】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 7.

Case 2： Final result without blood extravasation.</u>\n\n【57】extravasation was stopped . We stopped the procedure， and the patient was referred to the Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit， with close monitoring. No sign of pericar-dial effusion was detected afterward， and his symptoms im-proved significantly. He was discharged after 2 days.\n\n【58】Discussion\n\n【59】Our cases suggest that a Histoacryl-Lipiodol mixture could be a good alternative method to manage coronary perfora-tion during CTO PCI.\n\n【60】Video 4. Injection of 2 mL of Histoacryl-Lipiodol mixture (ratio1：3) through the microcatheter into the false lumen， and after several seconds， the extravasation was stopped.\n\n【61】Our first patient was a middle-aged man with multivessel cor-onary artery disease who experienced significant angina symp-tom after RCA STEMI， even with optimal medication and good flow in the stent. Thus， revascularization was indicated to im-prove his symptoms. In addition， according to the 2021 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines， in selected hemodynamically stable patients with STEMI and multivessel disease， after successful primary PCl， staged PCI of a significant noninfarct artery stenosis is recommended to re-duce the risk of death or MI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.Our second case was an elderly man with a similar presentation. He had unstable angina with severe LAD stenosis and LCx CTO. The symptoms were signifi-cant even with successful LAD stenting and optimal medications. The indication for PCI was to reduce the patient’s symptoms. Unfortunately， the procedures were complicated by coronary perforation type Illa with evidence of extravasation. However， pericardial effusion was minimal in both cases.\n\n【62】In a study including 6245 cases of coronary intervention， the incidence of vessel perforation was 0.8%， and most lesions were complex， including CTO. Among them， 46% of patients had significant pericardial effusion and 12% died 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【63】The consideration of treatment of coronary artery perforation is based on many factors. The general approach includes sta-bilizing the patient with hemodynamic support and stopping antiplatelets and anticoagulants； platelet transfusion and prot-amine infusion can be considered. Urgent pericardiocentesis in cases of cardiac tamponade and prolonged balloon inflation to stop bleeding is necessary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In more severe cases that re-quire additional intervention， the treatment of choice includes\n\n【64】a covered stent， coils， microspheres， and surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Initially used to treat in-stent stenosis， covered stents are used to seal the perforation site and stop blood from leaking. These are commonly used for proximal larger perforations. Coil embo-lisms are considered the criterion standard for emergent seal-ing type Ill coronary perforation in distal parts. Ideally， coils should be prepared before inserting the microcatheter into the CTO lesion， but this is not always available. Also， it is time-consuming and significantly costly， with complicated perfora-tion， and requires experienced interventionists. The other op-tions， including auxiliary embolic agents such as subcutaneous fat tissue， clots， or thrombin， are widely available， although in our experience，they are time-consuming and inconvenient to prepare. Also，their effects are sometimes not predictable and are unreliable to stop the bleeding. The next option is micro-spheres， the particles used in many artery and venous embo-lisms. They are typically used for distal coronary artery per-foration， similar to coils. Among microspheres， the Histoacry. and Lipiodol mixture has several advantages.\n\n【65】Histoacry! (n-Butyl-2-Cyanoacrylate) is a regulatory-approved tissue adhesive. It is considered the best choice for portal vein embolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Lipiodo! (ethiodized oil) is a radio-opaque con-trast agent that is used widely in radiological investigation. The mixture of Histoacryl and Lipiodol at a 1： 3 ratio provid-ed an optimal embolization material with good flow proper-ties， a polymerization time of approximately 7 s， and excellent contrast definition. This mixture can be handled quickly， with minimum risk involved， when used with a 40% glucose solu-tion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Previously， the mixture has been widely used in clini-cal settings such as skin closure， sclerotherapy for gastrointes-tinal bleeding， mesh fixation， portal vein embolism， and hepatic embolization in hepatocellular carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Interventional radiologists have a rich experience using the mixture， and it has recently become available in many hospitals.\n\n【66】In our first case， we confidently embolized the distal LAD be-cause SPECT imaging showed moderate ischemia and there were no collaterals from the other vessels. The second case was done following the first case， as we gained more experience\n\n【67】References：\n\n【68】1\\. Stankovic G， Orlic D， Corvaja N， et al.

In both cases， we worked together with interventional radiologists in the same cardiac catheter-ization laboratory， and they always stood by to help. We have been using coils and covered stents for several coronary ar-tery perforation cases and， during the procedure， we were chal-lenged with many difficulties. Intracoronary injection of the Histoacryl-Lipiodol mixture has proved the fastest， most in-expensive and effective method of management for our cas-es. Previously， n-Butyl-Cyanoacrylate was reported to be effec-tive in managing coronary perforation in a CTO case that was similar to our cases； the authors also suggested that the glue plug could be “passed by a low tip load guide wire and under-go balloon angioplasty recreating a lumen\" 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【74】The adverse events expected after microsphere embolization include unintended vascular embolization， prolonged materi-al polymerization time， and catheter retention. The unexpect-ed embolization risk can be prevented with microcatheters and skill. The other adverse events are related to the interven-tionist's inexperience. This highlights the essential role of the doctor's experience in this high-risk procedure and leads us to use the Histoacryl-Lipiodol mixture. The effectiveness was observed in our cases： the perforation was sealed almost im-mediately， and the adverse effect was insignificant.\n\n【75】Conclusions\n\n【76】Coronary artery perforation is a life-threatening adverse event of PCI that requires immediate treatment. The operator's ex-perience， equipment availability， and cost should be consid-ered while dealing with the problem. Histoacryl and Lipiodol injection was a rapid and effective management method in 2rare cases of coronary artery perforation during PCI.\n\n【77】Declaration of Figures’ Authenticity\n\n【78】All figures submitted have been created by the authors who confirm that the images are original with no duplication and have not been previously published in whole or in part.\n\n【79】5\\.

Studies reported that the condition can occur temporarily during the normal development of writing skills in children， and can also could occur in children with developmental delays. In adults， it can be acquired after a brain lesion.\n\n【28】Case Report：\n\n【29】A right-handed 19-year-old Saudi woman presented with progressive-onset mirror writing in both hands， and with writing both languages， Arabic and English. The condition was transient and had gradually worsened over the previous 3 years. Recently， it was continuous. She denied a history of alcohol or illicit drug abuse. There was no history of head injury， dyslexia， learning disabilities， or transient mirror writing during writing development in her early school-age years. There was no similar condition in her family. The neuropsychological assessment was normal. Laboratory and imaging were performed to rule out structural lesions， and no underlying etiology was found. After 2 years of follow-up， the patient did not have other associated neuropsychological symptoms， and mirror writing was persistent.\n\n【30】Conclusions：\n\n【31】Mirror writing in this case was in the right-handed， healthy young woman and was idiopathic. The condition was benign and the 2-year follow-up neuropsychological assessment was normal. The patient lived with the condition， depending on computer typing instead of handwriting. and she had very good academic perfor-mance in the university.

Additionally， mirror writing was report-ed to be associated with Parkinson's disease，essential tremor， and cerebellar disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【35】In the present case report， we describe a case of progressive-onset mirror writing in both hands， in a right-handed young Saudi woman with both languages， Arabic and English， with no obvious underlying etiology after investigations.\n\n【36】Case Report\n\n【37】On April 2018， a 19-year-old Saudi woman， who was a right-handed student， was referred to the family medicine clinic from the student counseling clinic with a complaint of unintentional abnormal handwriting (mirror writing) that affected her aca-demic performance. The patient noticed a transient and grad-ual worsening of handwriting over the previous 3 years in the opposite direction to normal and with letters reversed， for both her native language (Arabic) and the English language， and the condition recently had become continuous. There was no history of being forced to switch to her right hand for writing in early childhood. Her reading and writing for both languages (English and Arabic) were learned at the same time in kindergarten at age 5 years. She was a born at full term， without antenatal or postnatal complications. Her medical， surgical， family， and so-cial histories were unremarkable. She denied a history of al-cohol intake or illicit drug abuse. There was no history of head trauma， dyslexia， learning disabilities， or transient mirror writ-ing during writing development in her early school-age years.\n\n【38】There was no history of focal neurological deficit and psycho-logical disorders， and no family history of similar conditions or neurological disorders. The patient was aware of her prob-lem and she was able to recognize that she wrote in the wrong direction. She was in the preparatory year in the College of Applied Studies and Community Service. All students who are accepted in this college should start with preparatory semes-ters that cover the basic sciences in the college. After that， the students are distributed between specialties based on the capacity of each department. Sometimes the nomination\n\n【39】is based on the student's grade point average (GPA). The pa-tient has good attendance， understanding her lectures， and had good concentration. Her computer skills were excellent， and she did not have difficulty typing on a computer or mobile device. The only problem she had was during exams， which required writing short essays. Her condition was affecting her exam evaluations and， consequently， her grades and GPA.\n\n【40】On examination， she was alert， cooperative， and well orient-ed in time and place. A standard neurological and psycholog-ical assessments were unremarkable，and other systemic ex-aminations were insignificant.\n\n【41】The patient was asked to write a paragraph with her right and left hands. She performed the task 3 times and the time need-ed to complete each task was observed . Analysis of the patient's writing in Figure 1 revealed the following：\n\n【42】The $ character was never reversed in spite of its 4 occurrenc-es in the mirror-written texts 通用删除1(英):<u>(2 times with each hand writing in Figure 1C and 1E)</u>. This observation is even more curious in that the $ character is composed from a vertical line (which cannot be reversed) and an“S\"，the“s” (in lowercase) being reversed in all the different mirror writings ， except in 1 occurrence.\n\n【43】All reversible digits (0， 1， and 8 cannot be distinguished from their reversal) were systematically reversed in the mirror writ-ings of Figure 1C and 1E： digits 3 six times； 4 two times； 5 four times， and 6 two times.\n\n【44】In the normal English writing ， there is an intrusion of 14 reversed letters： the“s\"，“e”， and “r”are each reversed 3times， the “a” reversed 2 time， and the“f”，“y\"，and“u”are each reversed 1 time. A systematic analysis of the letters shows that there are more reversed letters in the normal writing of Figure 1A(14 out of 248) than in the mirror writing of Figure 1C (0 out of248). In the normal Arabic writing ， there is an intru-sion of 1 reversed letter that was reversed 1 time (1 out of 246). On the other hand， in the mirror writing of Figure 1D， there is no reversed letter to the normal (0 out of 246). The Fisher’s ex-act test yielded a p-value <0.0001 for the difference between normal and abnormal writing in English and the same for the difference between normal and abnormal in Arabic. Therefore. in the writing of the dictated sentence the patient was not only faster (8 vs. 2 minutes in English and 6 vs. 1 in Arabic)， but also there were more letter (or digit) reversals in her normal English and Arabic writings than in her English and Arabic mirror writing.\n\n【45】Moreover， the ability of the patient to copy and dictate through the computer was assessed . She was able to write in the normal direction， but with more effort. When we showed her a mirrored text， she found it difficult to read.\n\n【46】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1. Initial assessment of the patient with right and left hands’writing in both English and Arabic languages (left and right panels， respectively)， showing (top-to-bottom) copying and dictation of a paragraph with a mirror-reversed with both hands and both languages as well. Figures A and B showed dictating tasks in the right hand with normal writing directions， performed with efforts， and took 8 and 6 minutes， respectively. Figures C and D showed dictating tasks in the right hand with mirror writing， performed effortlessly， and took 2 and 1 minutes， respectively. Figures E and F demonstrated dictating tasks performed by the left hand with mirror writing and took 3 and 2 minutes， respectively. Figures G and H showed copying tasks by her right hand and took 1 minute in both with mirror writing. Figures I and J showed copying tasks by her left hand with mirror writing appearance and took 2 minutes in both.</u>\n\n【47】Blood chemistry and thyroid function tests were within the normal limits.\n\n【48】Neurological consultation was done to rule out any patholog-ical causes. Non-contrast computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain were performed after 2 months and the results were normal. The neurologist finally discharged the patient with a diagnosis of idiopathic mirror writing without any evidence of neuropathological causes.\n\n【49】After that， based on all previous assessments， a medical re-port was released in July 2018 by her family medicine consul-tant with recommendations for the patient to be enrolled in a specialty that suited her condition. The medical report rec-ommendations were reviewed and approved by the dean-ship of the academic affair to support her academic progress.\n\n【50】Finally， on April 2020， the patient still had the mirror writing， she was in the fourth semester in accounting specialty under-graduate school， with a good academic performance，her GPA was 4.4 out of 5 and she received positive feedback from her tutors. Moreover， the neuropsychological assessment during follow-up was normal.\n\n【51】Discussion\n\n【52】Arabic characters， unlike English， are normally written from right to left. The patient in this report reversed the directions in both languages， Arabic and English. Additionally， the condi-tion was not associated with difficulties in reading or typing on the computer or mobile device. There were no previously reported cases of mirror writing in Arabic.\n\n【53】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2. The response of the patient ability to copy and dictate a paragraph by typing through computer. Figure A English paragraph and B Arabic paragraph， she performed the tasks effortlessly and took 30 seconds in each one.</u>\n\n【54】The literature revealed that this condition occurs almost al-ways in left-handed individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，7\\]</u>. The pathophysiology of the mirror writing is unclear. One hypothesis was that lesions in the left hemisphere resulted in a failure of the dominant hemisphere to prevent contribution of the non-dominant hemi-sphere during the writing process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【55】Our patient's neurological examination was normal. Moreover， no lesions appear with brain CT or MRI， which excluded the structural cause of the condition. Della Sala et al. reported a case of 59-year-old women with mirror writing after anxiety， and the condition disappeared when her anxiety resolved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In our patient， the psychological assessment revealed no ab-normality. She was right-handed， but when we ask her to write with the left hand， mirror writing occurred also. Canzano et al. reported that mirror writing with both hands is unusual 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Gottfried et al. reported a case of 51-year-old with mirror writ-ing in both hands after traumatic brain injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Our patient did not have a history of trauma.\n\n【56】The patient's writing in this case report demonstrated that all reversible digits were reversed in the mirror writing text. Moreover， there are more reversed letters in the norma! writ-ing of our patient than in mirror writing. A similar finding was seen in the Arabic writing. Additionally， in the writing of the dictated sentence (in both English and Arabic) the patient was faster and there were more letter (or digit) reversals in her nor-mal writing than in her mirror writing. These observations are important for 2 different reasons.\n\n【57】First， they contradict some classical ideas about mirror writing. Our patient， who mirror wrote with both hands， demonstrates\n\n【58】that mirror writing is not be restricted to persons writing with their left hand， as is generally the case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The patient in this case， who mirror wrote by abduction  as well as by adduction ， demonstrates that the abduction process is not necessary for mirror writ-ing. About abduction， it could be recalled that Erlenmeyer， in1880， suggested “abductive left-hand writing” (linkshandige Abductionsschrift in German) as a more appropriate name for Buchwald's “mirror writing\" 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【59】Second， many features of our patient's writing in this case can be compared with the recent findings in 5-year-old typical de-veloping children. Our patient’s facility for mirror writing is con-sistent with children's facility， the latter being demonstrated by the numerous character reversals and by the speed of mir-ror writing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，13\\]</u>. The patient’s mirror writing with the right hand as well the left hand is consistent with the finding that there was no difference in mirror writing between the children who spontaneously wrote with the left hand and those who spontaneously wrote with the right hand 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【60】Conclusions\n\n【61】In conclusion， mirror writing is a rare condition， especially in right-handed individuals， and with both hands writing. This case demonstrated a rare idiopathic etiology of this condition. The condition in our patient was benign for 2 years of follow up， she did not develop other symptoms， and she succeeded in her academic life. Moreover， to the best of our knowledge， this is the first reported case from an Arab country， and onset was in a young adult. Physicians should diagnose the condition by exclusion. In these cases， since no underlying etiology was detected， we recommend that physicians reassure the patients and support them to continue with the most appropriate spe-cialty for them in which they depend on computer typing rath-er than handwriting during studying and even in their career.\n\n【62】Acknowledgements\n\n【63】We thank the patient for her written consent for publication of this case and the figures.

This patient was ini-tially diagnosed with disseminated tuberculosis of the lungs， liver， and peritoneum. After 4 months of anti-tu-berculosis treatment， she developed new right temporal hemianopia and new cerebral tuberculoma， which was identified on repeated magnetic resonance imaging (MRl) and was attributed to tuberculosis-immune recon-stitution inflammatory syndrome. The anti-tuberculosis treatment was continued； however， she gained large amounts of weight， which resulted in the failure of the anti-tuberculosis treatment of the cerebral tuberculo-ma. We decided to adjust the anti-tuberculosis drug dosage using her total body weight， and she responded well， with a decrease in size of the cerebral tuberculoma. The anti-tuberculosis treatment was subsequently stopped after 3 years because of clinical and imaging improvement.\n\n【24】Conclusions： This case illustrates the challenges faced in the treatment of cerebral tuberculoma， which， in this case， includ-ed a high body mass index affecting drug dosage and confounding an inadequate treatment response as seen on interim MRl， resulting in prolonged duration of anti-tuberculosis treatment. Persistent enhancement seen on brain MRI does not equate to treatment failure.\n\n【25】Keywords： Infectious Disease Medicine · Obesity·Tuberculoma ·Tuberculoma， Intracranial\n\n【26】Ful-text PDE https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/932852\n\n【27】口\n\n【28】十1577 1\n\n【29】15\n\n【30】Tuberculosis is prevalent， especially in low-income countries. The most devastating manifestation of tuberculosis is central nervous system involvement， albeit rare. The diagnosis of tu berculoma is challenging despite the vast developments in cur-rent laboratory and imaging modalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. We report the case of a patient with morbid obesity and disseminated tuberculo-sis of the lungs， liver， and peritoneum， and cerebral tuberculo-ma. There is a lack of published data reporting cases of tuber-culosis treatment in patients with morbid obesity， with only 2similar case reports in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>.\n\n【31】Case Report\n\n【32】A 26-year-old woman with newly diagnosed Child-Pugh class A hepatitis C presented with low-grade fever， productive cough， abdominal distension， and loss of weight and appetite for 2months. On examination， she appeared alert with stable he-modynamic parameters. There was non-tender shifting dull-ness on abdominal examination， and other systemic exami-nations were unremarkable.\n\n【33】Laboratory investigations showed a normal complete blood count and renal profile， with mild transaminitis and albumin level of26 g/L The results of diagnostic peritoneocentesis showed a low serum ascites albumin gradient of 0.6 g/dL， with no ev-idence of infection or malignancy. Owing to suspicious chest X-ray findings， a computed tomography (CT) scan was per-formed and showed multiple miliary nodules in the lungs， with liver and kidney micro-abscesses. A sputum GeneXpert assay detected the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis， with no resistance to rifampicin. Other infective screenings were neg ative， including blood， sputum， and peritoneal fluid cultures， melioidosis serology， peritoneal fluid， and sputum acid-fast ba-cilli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis cultures. A final diagnosis of disseminated tuberculosis was made and the World Health Organization (WHO) category I anti-tuberculosis treatment was commenced， resulting in clinical and radiological improvement.\n\n【34】However， 4 months into treatment， the patient developed new-onset right temporal hemianopia， which progressively worsened. Urgent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed caseating tuberculomas with optochiasmatic arach-noiditis . Cerebrospinal fluid analysis， including bacterial and fungal cultures， cytology， and tuberculosis work-up， was noncontributory. We decided to continue the anti-tu-berculosis maintenance treatment (a fixed-dose combination of rifampicin and isoniazid) for 18 months. Her hemianopia improved gradually； however， a repeat MRI revealed an inad-equate treatment response， with a residual lesion and perile-sional edema .\n\n【35】The patient had a drastic weight gain (from 67 kg to 110kg) throughout the maintenance phase. Considering the proce-dure risks and related perioperative morbidity and mortality， the patient refused a diagnostic brain biopsy. We attributed the unsatisfactory treatment response to the possible under-dosing of the anti-tuberculosis agent， decided to adjust the anti-tuberculosis treatment dosage based on the patient's to tal body weight， and added pyrazinamide into the regimen， which comprised rifampicin (9.6 mg/kg)， isoniazid (4.6 mg/kg)， pyrazinamide (18.2 mg/kg)， and pyridoxine 50 mg once daily， owing to the higher dose of isoniazid. This regimen was given for 2 months， followed by another 16 months of isoniazid and rifampicin maintenance， with directly observed short-course supervision to ensure patient compliance. We conducted close monitoring of the patient's liver function tests， and no adverse events were observed. Serial brain imaging showed significant improvement. After cessation of treatment， the patient was followed up closely for 12 months. She had minimal residual right temporal hemianopia， which did not interfere with her daily life activities. A repeat MRI 1 year after treatment com-pletion showed a stable lesion .\n\n【36】Discussion\n\n【37】The cornerstone in treatment of disseminated tuberculosis and cerebral tuberculoma is anti-tuberculosis drugs with or with-out surgical intervention. Our patient's clinical and radiologi-cal findings were highly suggestive of tuberculosis.Owing to the high prevalence of tuberculosis in our region， we decided against performing a brain biopsy， which is indicated in events of uncertain diagnosis or failed medical therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【38】Our patient had co-existing hepatitis C with grade 2 trans-aminitis， even before the commencement of anti-tubercu-losis treatment. Her liver function remained stable through-out treatment， consistent with the fact that anti-tuberculosis treatment can be safely given in patients with liver disease通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Hepatitis C treatment was deferred in our patient owing to the concern of a drug-drug interaction and possible wors-ening hepatotoxicity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【39】Tuberculosis immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome(IRIS)， found in HlV-infected and uninfected individuals， re-sults from a heightened inflammatory response， secondary to the reversal of immunosuppression by anti-tuberculosis treat-ment. This usually develops around 3 months after the initi-ation of anti-tuberculosis treatment， with a higher incidence in disseminated or extrapulmonary tuberculosis because of a higher bacillary load 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Two types of tuberculosis IRIS have been identified， paradoxical and unmasking. Paradoxical tu-berculosis IRIS is defined by the worsening of pre-existing disease status or the emergence of new lesions in patients\n\n【40】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1. (A) Multiple enhancing lesions of varying sizes</u>\n\n【41】scattered predominantly in the supratentorial brain. Most of them depicted a hypointense signal on T2-weighted image and T1-weighted image with rim enhancement after gadolinium contrast. (B) Some of the lesions coalesced，representing a conglomerate of tubercular micro-granulomas.(C) The lesions decreased in number and size but retained similar imaging characteristics as those of caseating granulomas， without central T2-weighted image hyperintensity to suggest progression to central liquefaction or tuberculous abscesses. (D) Increasing perilesional edema at the left medial temporal lobe associated with the left suprasellar lesions. (E) Residual lesions of the left suprasellar tuberculomas conglomerates.\n\n【42】who initially responded to anti-tuberculosis treatment， and it is not due to unsuccessful treatment or a new disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Similarly， in our patient， the cerebral tuberculoma developed after several months of treatment， with a new onset of hemi-anopia， likely attributable to paradoxical tuberculosis IRIS， as a consequence of a high mycobacterial antigen load released from the rapid killing of mycobacteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Diagnosis is mainly clinical， as there is no specific diagnostic tool for tuberculosis IRIS. The recommended therapy is to continue with the anti-tuberculosis treatment， and clinical improvements are gener-ally seen 2 months into treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【43】Obesity affects the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs by impairing drug binding to albumin， increasing Cy-tochrome P450 2E1 activity， and increasing phase ll conjuga-tion activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Our patient had morbid obesity， with a body mass index (BMI) of 43 kg/m? The American Thoracic Society/Center for Disease Control and Prevention/Infectious Diseases Society of America tuberculosis treatment guideline advocates the use of the ideal body weight for calculating anti-tuberculo-sis treatment dosages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Similarly， the WHO proposes cap-ping the rifampicin and isoniazid dosages at 600 mg and 300mg， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. These recommendations can subject pa-tients with obesity to underdosing， which can lead to treat-ment failure， as evidenced in our case. Total body weight， in contrast， is recommended by others and potentially has more adverse effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The use of a fixed-dose combination is chal-lenging in patients with obesity because dose individualization is difficult. One case report describes a man with a weight of92 kg and a BMI of 28.4 kg/m² who was prescribed the max-imum dose of the fixed-dose combination， which resulted in treatment failure. Therapeutic drug monitoring that was done found the drugs were at subtherapeutic concentrations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In the present case， owing to an inadequate initial response， the anti-tuberculosis treatment dosage was readjusted based on our patient's total body weight， with single-drug formulations， which resulted in a remarkable treatment response after 18months， without significant adverse reactions.\n\n【44】Some experts suggest continuing treatment until the radiolog-ical resolution of enhancing lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. However， this prac-tice can unnecessarily expose patients to the prolonged dura-tion of potentially toxic drugs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Most researchers did not agree that persistent enhancement seen on brain MRI beyond18 months equates to treatment failure； thus， the extended duration of anti-tuberculosis treatment was not justifiable通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. In our case， anti-tuberculosis treatment was initially continued because of residual perilesional edema and was subsequent-ly stopped after a total of 3 treatments upon improvement of the lesions on MRI. There is a dire need for future prospec-tive clinical trials to generate evidence-based guidelines with regards to the duration of treatment for patients with intra-cranial tuberculomas.\n\n【45】Our patient’s initial MRI study showed multiple enhancing le-sions of varying sizes， scattered predominantly in the supra-tentorial brain. Most of them depicted a hypointense signal on T2-weighted and Tl-weighted images， with rim enhance-ment after gadolinium contrast ， suggestive of ca seating granulomas with solid centers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Some of the le-sions coalesced， representing a conglomerate of tubercular micro-granulomas ， which parenchymal tuberculo-mas have the propensity to form 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. The absence of pachy-meningeal or leptomeningeal enhancement in the present case signified no concurrent meningitis. On subsequent MRI， apart from decreasing in number and size， the le-sions retained similar imaging characteristics as those of ca-seating granulomas， without central T2-weighted image hy-perintensity to suggest the progression to central liquefaction or tuberculous abscesses. However， there was increasing per-ilesional edema at the left medial temporal lobe， associated with the left suprasellar lesions， hence anti-tuberculosis treat-ment was escalated . A few subsequent follow-up studies showed improvement of disease， and the most recent MRI (about 3 years after the initial study) demonstrated resid-ual lesions of the left suprasellar tuberculoma conglomerates. The good response to anti-tuberculosis treatment on follow-up studies in the present case supports the diagno-sis of parenchymal tuberculosis. However， there are broad dif-ferential diagnoses for rim-enhancing lesions， including toxo-plasmosis， neurocysticercosis， pyogenic abscess， metastasis， and lymphoma of the central nervous system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【46】Conclusions\n\n【47】Our case highlighted the dilemma posed in managing patients with morbid obesity with cerebral tuberculoma. There is no definite guideline on the dosing of anti-tuberculosis drugs for patients with obesity. Persistent enhancement after anti-tu-berculosis treatment makes deciding the appropriate duration of therapy difficult. Clinical trials comparing the standard du-ration versus the imaging-guided duration of anti-tuberculo-sis would be ideal. Studies on appropriate weight-based dos-ing of anti-tuberculosis treatment for patients with obesity will be beneficial to clinicians managing such patients in re-al-world practice.\n\n【48】Acknowledgements\n\n【49】The authors would like to thank the Director General of Health Malaysia and Clinical Research Center (CRC) Miri Hospital for the permission to publish this paper.\n\n【50】Conflicts of Interest\n\n【51】This article contains studies with human participants and was registered via the National Medica!

Eculizumab， a human monoclonal antibody， blocks the final stages\n\n【27】Case Report：\n\n【28】of the complement system. Several studies have shown that complement C5 monoclonal antibodies are effec-tive in treating secondary TMA. Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is one of the most common causes of secondary TMA， and early diagnosis is important because TMA secondary to SSc has a poor prognosis. We report a case of TMA secondary to SSc that did not respond to eculizumab， despite the presence of severe complement activation. A 61-year-old previously healthy man was admitted for acute renal failure and thrombocytopenia. TMA was sus-pected because hemolytic anemia， thrombocytopenia， and organ damage were detected. Based on the physi-cal findings， we suspected SSc as the underlying cause. All tests for specific antibodies，including Scl-70，were negative， and C5b-9 levels were markedly elevated (11 041 ng/mL). We initiated plasma exchange on day 3， followed by eculizumab therapy， but with limited improvement. SSc with secondary TMA was identified upon further testing. After completion of the plasma exchange， the platelet count was maintained above 30 000/uL.\n\n【29】Creatinine levels gradually decreased， and the patient was weaned off dialysis. Steroid treatment for SSc was\n\n【30】continued， and the patient was eventually discharged.\n\n【31】Conclusions：\n\n【32】A case of SSc-TMA was ineffectively treated with eculizumab， despite abnormal activation of the complement system. Continuous monitoring and investigation are required， and discontinuation of eculizumab should be determined according to the final diagnosis.\n\n【33】Keywords： Complement Activation· Eculizumab · Plasma Exchange · Scleroderma， Systemic Thrombotic Microangiopathies\n\n【34】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/936116\n\n【35】目名11929 2 山g\n\n【36】2\n\n【37】丰 国 22\n\n【38】Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is characterized by throm-bocytopenia， microangiopathic hemolytic anemia， and organ damage. The acute mortality rate of TMA due to delayed treat-ment is extremely high， and early treatment with plasma ex-change and complement inhibitors is required. TMA is mainly classified into 4 types： thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura(TTP)， which is caused by a marked decrease in a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 mo-tifs 13 (ADAMTS13) activity； Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS)； atypical HUS (aHUS)， which is caused by abnormal complement control； and secondary TMAs caused by other diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【39】Several diseases and conditions can cause secondary TMA，in-cluding collagen diseases， hematopoietic stem cell transplanta-tion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， medications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>， pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，4\\]</u>， and infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Secondary TMAs are caused by vascular endothelial damage via various inflammatory reactions， including complement activa-tion. Rapidly differentiating secondary TMAs is difficu lt because emergently introducing treatments such as plasma exchange is needed once TMA is diagnosed， regardless of identification of the causative disease. According to some experts， comple-ment activation is important regardless of the type of TMA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>， and several reports state that treatment with a complement C5 monoclonal antibody is effective in secondary TMAs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【40】Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a cause of secondary TMA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Secondary TMA caused by SSc has a poor prognosis； there-fore， early diagnosis is important 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Another complication of SSc is scleroderma renal crisis (SRC). The main pathogene-sis of SRC is increased blood pressure and systemic vasocon-striction due to decreased renal blood flow and renin released by thickened and proliferated arcuate and interlobular arter-ies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The main treatments for SRC are angiotensin-convert-ing enzyme inhibitors. SRC occasionally presents with normal blood pressure (normotensive SRC) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In addition to acute kidney injury， patients with SRC show thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. These SRC findings， similar to those of TMA， make the differential diagnosis diffi-cult. Furthermore， there have been reports of SRC complicat-ed by TMA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【41】In this article， we report a case of TMA secondary to SSc that was unresponsive to eculizumab， despite the presence of se-vere complement activation.\n\n【42】Case Report\n\n【43】A 61-year-old man with no previous underlying medical con-dition visited a local clinic because of common cold-like\n\n【44】symptoms. The patient had petechiae of unknown onset on his trunk， and returned 11 days later because of constipa-tion and abdominal distension. After being subsequently di-agnosed with acute kidney injury and thrombocytopenia， the patient was transferred to our hospital. Upon further exami-nation， the patient's temperature was 37.2℃， blood pressure was 110/62 mmHg， heart rate was 104 beats/min， respirato-ry rate was 12 breaths/min， and oxygen saturation was 97%(ambient air). The eyelids and conjunctiva were pale， the tips of the fingers and toes were poorly pigmented ， the nails had epithelial hemorrhages， and purpura were present on the trunk and extremities. He had acute kidney injury with a blood urea nitrogen level of 149.4 mg/dL and creatinine lev-el of 6.15 mg/dL， and a platelet count markedly decreased to7000/uL .\n\n【45】On the basis of the findings of hemolytic anemia， thrombo-cytopenia， and organ dysfunction， we considered the patho-genesis of TMA. Various tests， including those for ADAMTS13activity，ADAMTS13 inhibitor， and other diseases causing sec-ondary TMAs， were performed to identify the cause of TMA. We suspected aHUS rather than TTP because the renal impair-ment was obvious. We initiated continuous hemodiafiltration for acute kidney injury on the day of admission. SSc was sus-pected because of swelling of the fingers， poorly colored fin-gertips， and bleeding under the nail fold. No specific antibod-ies， including the Scl-70 antibody， were detected at the initial screening. On the other hand， the levels of C3 were reduced to 59 mg/dL (reference range 86-160 mg/dL)， the levels of C4were reduced to 12 mg/dL (reference range 17-45 mg/mL)，50% homolytic complement activity was reduced to 19 U/mL(reference range 25-48 U/mL)， and soluble C5b-9 was mark-edly elevated to 11 041 ng/mL (reference range <303 ng/mL)， suggesting complement activation. A positive result for oc-cult blood on urinalysis and the presence of schistocytes in the blood smear indicated intravascular hemolysis， although haptoglobin type 2-2 did not decrease .\n\n【46】Plasma exchange was initiated on day 3 because of progressive necrosis of the hand. However， the effects of plasma exchange were limited. No abnormalities were found in ADAMTS13 ac-tivity or ADAMTS13 inhibitor in the plasma submitted prior to plasma exchange， and no Shiga toxin-producing E. coli were cultured， ruling out STEC-HUS and TTP. The patient was clin-ically diagnosed with aHUS. As the patient did not respond to plasma exchange， we administered 900 mg of eculizumab on days 7 and 14. On day 21， a week after the second eculi-zumab administration， the platelet count and creatinine lev-els did not change. Eculizumab treatment was then terminat-ed after 2 doses. On day 18， we initiated methylprednisolone1000 mg/day for 3 days， followed by prednisolone 20 mg/day until day 71. We transfused 30 units of platelet concen-trate on day 42.\n\n【47】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1. The patient's hand and sole at(A) admission and (B) on day 12.</u>\n\n【48】(A) The patient's hand exhibited purpura that extended to the tips as well as skin sclerosis on fingertips.\n\n【49】(B) The ischemic lesion on his fingers were exacerbated and purpura on his sole revealed.\n\n【50】On day 48， we obtained the results of additional tests that were positive for antinuclear antibody quantification 20 480times， anti-centromere antibody 14.4 (+/-)， anti-NOR-90 an-tibody (anti-hUBF antibody)， and anti-fibrillarin antibody (an-ti-U3-RNP antibody). Plasma renin activity levels were normal. Thus， the patient was diagnosed with SSc with secondary TMA. Because the necrosis on the patient’s fingers and toes wors-ened with interruption of plasma exchange， we performed plasma exchange 24 times until day 64. After the completion of plasma exchange， the platelet count was maintained at>30 000/pL .\n\n【51】The patient developed complete atrioventricular block and repeated sinus arrest on day 60， and an external pacemaker was inserted. Myocardial conduction tract defect due to SSc was diagnosed， and additional steroid pulse therapy was ad-ministered for 3 days starting on day 112. Regarding renal\n\n【52】function， the patient's creatinine levels gradually decreased， and the patient was weaned off dialysis on day 151. Steroid treatment for SSc was continued， and the patient was dis-charged on day 279.\n\n【53】Discussion\n\n【54】Here， we present a case of SSc concomitant with secondary TMA. At presentation， the clinical scenario suggested TMAs， such as severe thrombocytopenia，microangiopathic hemolyt-ic anemia， and renal dysfunction. Through continuous explo-ration for the underlying disease， we finally diagnosed the pa-tient with SSc. Although the soluble C5b-9 levels were markedly elevated， the patient did not respond to the terminal comple-ment inhibitor eculizumab.

Since there was no history of steroid administration， which is a risk factor for SSc-TMA， and the anti-Scl-70 antibody test was negative at the initial screening， diagnosing SSc as a cause of TMA was challenging. Finally， the patient was diag-nosed with SSc based on the positive results for anti-fibrillarin(anti-U3-RNP) and anti-NOR-90 (anti-hUBF) antibodies. Anti-fibrillarin antibodies are detected in 4% to 10% of patients with SSc and are associated with pulmonary hypertension and fi-brosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，14\\]</u>. Anti-NOR-90 antibodies are observed in patients with relatively mild SSc and have been associated with other autoimmune disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. However， these antibodies have not been reported as risk factors for renal damage. As in this case， the diagnosis of SSC as the causative disease of TMA is challenging in patients with severe renal dysfunction and neg-ative results for the anti-Scl-70 antibody. Anti-fibrillarin and anti-NOR-90 antibodies are key to the diagnosis.\n\n【57】In SSc， different pathologies are known to cause renal dysfunc-tion， such as SRC， TMA (SSC-TMA)， and anti-neutrophil cyto-plasmic antibody-associated vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>； they also overlap with other collagen diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjogren syndrome) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. In particular， SRC is difficult to dif-ferentiate from TMA because of their similar clinical findings， such as low platelet count and renal dysfunction， and they can occur concomitantly. In the present case， normal plasma renin\n\n【58】activity and the absence of severe hypertension suggested that the primary pathogenesis was SSc-TMA.\n\n【59】In general， TMA is diagnosed based on microangiopathic he-molytic anemia， thrombocytopenia， and organ damage due to platelet thrombi. Guidelines recommend plasma exchange as soon as possible after the diagnosis of TMA. Atypical HUS tends to involve renal function more commonly than TTP and should be treated with eculizumab as early as possible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. At the initial screening for the causative diseases of TMAs， we could not detect causative diseases， such as systemic lupus erythematosus， anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome， and SSc. Thus， we strongly suspected aHUS and administered ec-ulizumab accordingly because of the presence of severe re-nal impairment and abnormal complement activation. Martis et al reported that aHUS is often associated with no previous dialysis history and higher creatinine and lactate dehydroge-nase levels than those found in autoimmune disease-related TMAs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Therefore， we concluded that the early administra-tion of eculizumab was appropriate in this case of high aHUS suspicion. We discontinued eculizumab administration after2 doses of ineffective therapy； there was no improvement in the platelet count or renal function， and we did not want to subject the patient to unwarranted adverse effects. For pa-tients showing TMA findings， especially for those with severe renal dysfunction， eculizumab should be administered as soon as possible for the clinical likelihood of aHUS， and should be\n\n|  |  | Normal range  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| (initial screening)  |  |  |\n| Haptoglobin (mg/L)  | 1100  | 300-2000  |\n| Direct Coombs test  | Negative  | Negative  |\n| Indirect Coombs test  | Negative  | Negative  |\n| ADAMTS13 activity (%)  | 14.8  | \\>70  |\n| ADAMTS13 inhibitor (BU)  | <0.4  | <0.4  |\n| Anti-LPS-IgM Antibody  | Negative  | Negative  |\n| Anti-nuclear Antibody  | 1：20480  | 1：40  |\n| Anti-CL-IgG Antibody (U/mL)  | 8  | <10  |\n| Anti-ds-DNA Antibody (U/mL)  | 10  | <30  |\n| Anti-RNP Antibody (U)  | <1.0  | <1.0  |\n| Anti-scl-70 Antibody (U)  | <1.0  | <1.0  |\n| Anti-SS-A Antibody (U)  | <1.0  | <1.0  |\n| Anti-SS-B Antibody(U)  | <1.0  | <1.0  |\n| Anti-RNA polymerase III Antibody  | 13  | <28  |\n| PR3-ANCA (U)  | <1.0  | <1.0  |\n| MPO-ANCA (U)  | <1.0  | <1.0  |\n| Plasma renin activity(ng/ml/h)  | 0.7  | 0.2-2.3  |\n| Complement component 3 (g/L)  | 0.59  | 0.73-1.38  |\n| Complement component 4 (g/L)  | 0.12  | 0.11-0.31  |\n| 50% homolytic complement activity (U/ml)  | 19  | 25.0-48.0  |\n| Soluble complement 5b-9 (ng/mL)  | 11041  | <250  |\n| (additionat tests)  |  |  |\n| Anti-NOR90/hUBF Antibody  | Positive  | Negative  |\n| Anti-fibrillarin Antibody  | Positive  | Negative  |\n\n【61】ADAMTS13 - a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motifs 13； LPS-lipopolysaccharide； IgM -immunoglobulin M； CL-cardiolipin； IgG -immunoglobulin G； Anti-CL B2GP-anti-cardiolipin antibody/β2-glycoprotein； ds-DNA-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid； RNP-ribonucleoprotein； scl-70-topoisomerase-1； anti-SS-A， anti-Ro；anti-SS-B， anti-La； NOR90/hUBF -nucleolar organizing region 90/human upstream-binding factor； PR3-ANCA-anti-proteinase 3-antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies； MPO-ANCA- myeloperoxidase- antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies.\n\n【62】discontinued when further examinations indicate a diagnosis other than aHUS.\n\n【63】Interestingly， eculizumab has been reported to be effective in patients with secondary TMA who are not responsive to con-ventional treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.

There are a few case reports of SSc-TMA that responded to eculizumab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21，22\\]</u>.

In the present case，\n\n【64】eculizumab was ineffective， while soluble C5b-9 was markedly elevated， suggesting abnormal activation of the complement terminal pathway. This paradox may indicate that the patho-genesis of SSc-TMA predominantly results from the antigen-antibody reaction， which leads to classical complement path-way activation followed by terminal pathway activation； thus， eculizumab may not be effective in SSc-TMA. It is necessary to accumulate more knowledge and study more cases to deter-mine exactly which patients would benefit from eculizumab.\n\n【65】In general， plasma exchange is expected to remove harmful in-flammatory substances and replace necessary protein compo-nents.

SRUB should always be included in the differential diagnoses of acute abdominal pain， the inability to void， and ascites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Although emer-gency reparative surgery is the key for a successful outcome， early diagnosis is crucial for survival. A few cases of blad-der wall rupture have been reported to be associated with bladder wall disease in the literature； however， the sponta-neous rupture of the urinary bladder without a history of disease is relatively uncommon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-6\\]</u>. Alcohol intoxication is reported as an etiology within a subset of idiopathic blad-der rupture cases. Patients with alcohol intoxication usually lose their memory of certain events and complain of non-specific abdominal pain. Unless bladder rupture is includ-ed in the differential diagnosis， it may not be recognized， and serious consequences can result. Historically， delayed diagnosis has led to morbidity and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【27】CASE REPORT\n\n【28】A 21-year-old man， who was previously healthy， was admit-ted to the emergency department of the hospital because of abdominal pain with distension for more than 16 hours. He had been intoxicated the day prior to coming to the hospital and reported having lost consciousness until awak-ening the next morning. Then， he complained of mild to moderate abdominal pain with abdominal distention and vomiting， so he was immediately brought to the emergency department. At the hospital he received 4 liters of normal saline， anti-infective and spasmolytic therapy； however， his abdominal pain was gradually increasing. The abdominal pain was located in the right lower abdomen without he-maturia or dysuria and fever， and the examination revealed moderate abdominal distention without tension. Results of blood tests in the emergency department were normal except for white blood cell count 15.31×10°/L (3.97-9.15×10°/L) and neutrophils 80%(50.0-70.0%). A radiograph of the pa-tient’s chest and abdomen showed a rising diaphragm and intestinal flatulence . A subsequent abdominal ultrasound showed complete resolution of the ascites， no urine in the bladder， and excluded appendicitis (data not shown). A non-contrast abdominal computed tomography(CT) scan revealed normal kidneys with a large amount of ascites . His past medical history was negative. He denied any recent nonsteroidal， anti-inflammatory drug use or any illicit drug use. He drank alcohol inconsistent-ly， but had a tendency to binge drink every few weeks. His family history was negative for renal disease. Because of in-creasing abdominal pain and severe distention with vom-iting and an inability to void， and since the diagnosis was still unclear， the patient was hospitalized and admitted to our department.\n\n【29】On physical examination， his vital signs were normal. His ab-domen was tender， but soft to palpation. He had a positive wave sign， indicating the presence of ascites. Laboratory ex-aminations showed the following indexes (normal range in parentheses)： hemoglobin，161 g/L (131-172g/L)；periph-eral white cell count， 17.36x10°/L (3.97-9.15×10°/L)；neu-trophils， 77.1%(50.0-70.0%)； serum sodium， 128.4 mmol/L(136.0-145.0 mmol/L)； serum creatinine， 453.0 umol/L(31.8-116.0 umol/L)； and serum BUN， 23.22 mmol/L\n\n【30】JUN-M-21Y Philips Medical Systems Hamburs\n\n【31】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

Some of the contrast me-dium entered the rectovesical excavation from the damaged bladder ， and a 4.0-cm crevasse located in the right posterior dome of the urinary bladder was observed. A cystoscopic examination confirmed the re-sult of the contrast-enhanced CT scan and did not find in-flammation or tumors in the bladder (Figure3).

Two weeks after his reparative surgery， he had no bladder leak on a voiding cystourethrogram (data not shown) and he was discharged.\n\n【39】DISCUSSION\n\n【40】Rupture of the urinary bladder is uncommon， but can be fatal. The dome of the bladder is the weakest area and thus has a high incidence of bladder rupture. The rupture of the posterior wall is mostly observed in patients who received ir-radiation for pelvic tumors， and the rupture of the anterior wall is observed in postpartum women. Rupture of the uri-nary bladder is often secondary to blunt trauma， pelvic irra-diation， urinary bladder tuberculosis or tumor， large bladder stone， and urethral stricture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Cases of alcohol intoxica-tion-induced spontaneous bladder rupture have been in-creasing in recent years. An increase in binge drinking in both men and women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， including younger age groups， seems to have resulted in increased incidence of SRUB.\n\n【41】SRUB is caused mainly by bladder overdistention and thin-ning of the dome wall secondary to a large volume of urine produced by the diuresis effect of alcohol 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In addition， patients who are intoxicated have an impaired sensorium and may not feel the urge to void. Moreover nausea and vomiting associated with alcohol abuse may increase intra-abdominal pressure and the likelihood of bladder rupture in the peritoneal cavity. SRUB is very rare， and most of the reported cases have accurred in association with alcohol intoxication. Late diagnosis and treatment of SRUB is as-sociated with high morbidity and a mortality rate of 50%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The high mortality rate is due to the complications of bladder rupture， such as hyperkalemia， renal failure， peri-tonitis and sepsis.\n\n【42】SRUB symptoms usually include severe abdominal pain and macroscopic hematuria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>，although only microscopic he-maturia was present in our patient. Several case reports doc-umented that urinary bladder rupture mimicked bladder ulcers， cholecystitis， pancreatitis， intra-abdominal trauma， bowel obstruction， severe gastritis， acute renal failure， myo-cardial infarction， and other serious illnesses. In the early stages after bladder rupture， symptoms can be mild，vague， and diffuse and thus may lead to misdiagnosis.\n\n【43】The elevation of creatinine in the reported case was prob-ably caused by the direct absorption of urinary creatinine from the ascitic fluid. SRUB should be suspected in patients with extreme alcohol intoxication， abdominal pain，and low or intermittent urine output. A CT cystogram or an abdomi-nal CT contrast-enhanced scan is the procedure of choice to confirm the diagnosis.A cystoscopic examination is helpful\n\n【44】for clearing pathogenesis or repairing damage caused by SRUB. Paracentesis can also be performed； an ascitic flu-id creatinine/serum creatinine ratio greater than 1.0 sug-gests an intra-peritoneal urine leak 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Reparative sur一gery was the standard of care in most of the reported cases通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. However， a cystoscopic minimally in vasive reparative surgery could be achieved if urinary leakage into the peri-toneal cavity is prevented.\n\n【45】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【46】For SRUB， early diagnosis and treatment of this condition is crucial because any delay may increase mortality and mor-bidity secondary to renal failure manifestations.

Management can be conservative or surgical. Radiologically they can appear similar to splenic tumours. Splenic tumours are rare and can be very aggressive in nature.\n\n【9】Case Report：\n\n【10】We describe a case of a 68yr old man presenting with left upper quadrant pain who was thought to have a pulmonary embolus. A spontaneous splenic haematoma was identified on his CT scan. Laparotomy revealed a primary splenic tumour infiltrating local structures and a macroscopic resection was performed. Histology revealed a possible spindle cell tumour， inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour or mesothelioma of unclear aetiology. Extensive metastases were identified 3 months following surgery. The patient represented 4 months following surgery with sepsis due to a colonic fistula and the patient died.\n\n【11】Conclusions：\n\n【12】Caution must be taken when diagnosing a splenic haematoma in the abscenc of trauma. Splenic tumours can be highly aggressive and incurable. Histological classification of the tumour may not always be possible.\n\n【13】Key words： splenectomy· abdominal neoplasms -surgery·inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour\n\n【14】Full-text PDF： http：//www.amjcaserep.com/fulltext.php?ICID=12211\n\n【15】Word count：\n\n【16】1334\n\n【17】Tables： 一\n\n【18】Figures：\n\n【19】2\n\n【20】References：\n\n【21】7\n\n【22】Author's address： Matthew J.

Spontaneous， non traumatic splenic haematomas are associated with pancreatitis and infections includ-ing malaria and dengue fever， and require urgent as-sessment for risk of rupture. Differential diagnoses must include hamartomas， splenic angiomas， haema-tological neoplasms， infarctions and metastatic carci-nomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>， though these are rare， of varying aetiology and prognosis. Primary splenic tumours are rare but must be considered when splenomegaly is present.\n\n【24】CASE REPORT\n\n【25】A 68 year old man presented to the Accident and Emergency department with an atraumatic 6 week history of left upper quadrant and pleuritic chest pain. This was accompanied by a 6 month history of weight loss， night sweats and a cough. He was an asthmatic， an ex-smoker with a 30 pack year history， consumed minimal alcohol and denied asbestos exposure.\n\n【26】On examination there was decreased air entry at the left lung base. His full blood count was normal. A chest X-ray showed a raised left hemidiaphragm. A pulmonary embolism was suspected and a computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram excluded this， but revealed a large abdominal heterogeneous mass， measuring 18x17 x 9cm， which appeared to be inseparable from the spleen ， in the left subdiaphragmatic space. The mass consisted of soft tissue and fluid densities. A spontaneous splenic haematoma was thought to be the most likely diag-nosis. The liver appeared normal.\n\n【27】To prevent haematoma rupture， a splenectomy was performed. Operative findings included a soft tissue\n\n【28】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1. The spleen is enlarged and irregular with a mixed fluid and soft tissue density.</u>\n\n【29】mass which included the spleen and a possible organised haematoma， attached to omentum and diaphragmatic muscle. The mass and its attachments were excised.\n\n【30】Histology revealed a 1kg spleen with nodular tumour masses infiltrating the splenic tissue and bulging through the outer surface. The attached diaphragm and omentum appeared thickened and fibrotic. Sections from the spleen showed a focally necrotic spindle cell tumour， with mild pleomorphism and marked inflammation. Chronic inflammatory cell in-filtrate was present. The attached diaphragm showed a high grade pleomorphic tumour with very high mitotic activity and inflammation.\n\n【31】In the spleen， the spindle cells were diffusely positive for SMA and focally so for S100 protein， CD34 and CD31， but negative for caldesmon， calponin， CD68， CD3， and CD20. In the diaphragmatic tumour， there was focal positivity for cytokeratin AE1-3， SMA CD68and CD31 and negative staining markers included CK7，CK20， PSA and TTF1. Neither tumour stained for EMA， calretinin， BerEP4， CD21-35， CD117， HMB45， CD45， CD30， FVIIIRAg， FLI-1， HHV8， CD20， CD3 nor desmin.\n\n【32】The patient made an uneventful recovery， but re-turned to hospital a month later complaining of on-going left sided abdominal pain， thought to be due to a haematoma， later seen on ultrasound.\n\n【33】CT scan 3 months after his initial presentation showed multiple bilobar liver metastases， a right adrenal\n\n【34】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2. An elevated， thickened left hemidiaphragm with extension beyond the abdominal cavity into neighbouring soft tissue(arrow).</u>\n\n【35】nodule plus a left upper quadrant gas and fluid containing collection. Abnormal soft tissue was also noted in the left upper quadrant， mesentery， anterior abdominal wall and in the left paracolic gutter. A posi-tron emission tomography scan confirmed extensive metastatic disease in the abdominal cavity.\n\n【36】Prior to chemotherapy commencing， he represented with abdominal pain. CT scan demonstrated a fistula from the transverse colon to recurrent left hypochon-drial tumour mass and showed widespread tumour progression throughout the abdomen. The patient died of sepsis a few days later.\n\n【37】DISCUSSION\n\n【38】The initial diagnosis of a spontaneous splenic hae-matoma meant in the absence of ongoing bleed-ing， conservative management might have seemed appropriate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Spontaneous splenic haematomas are recognized complications of infectious mono-nucleosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， though tumour associated haemorrhage must also be considered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Symptomatic debulk-ing of the primary splenic tumour was appropriate in this case.\n\n【39】A definitive conclusion could not be reached as to whether one or two tumours were being represented. The spindle cell splenic tumour showed features of an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour (IMT) but the pleomorphism and the necrosis indicate a higher degree of malignancy than usually found. The im-munophenotype (with S100 protein， CD34 as well as SMA) would be exceptional for an IMT. IMTs are thought to arise as a result of a local inflammatory reaction， possibly in response to infection or another neoplasm. This patient had no identifiable infections\n\n【40】REFERENCES：\n\n【41】1\\. Sterlacci W， Heiss S， Augustin F， Tzankov A.

The diaphragmatic tumour showed a more epithelial morphology with cytokeratin positivity， possibly a mesothelioma though markers are lacking. The findings did not support GI stromal tumour or lymphoma. Splenic tumours are rare as are clinically significant splenic metasta-ses. Given the spleen’s large blood flow， metastases would be expected， yet the spleens ability to destroy abnormal cells is remarkable.\n\n【49】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【50】We describe an unusual presentation of an unclassified splenic tumour. Initial imaging of the mass showing its extension beyond the abdominal cavity， in the absence of trauma， makes the diagnosis of a tumour more likely， The possibility of an invading diaphrag-matic mesothelioma further makes this case unique. The rapid recurrence of this tumour with fistula for-mation within 3 months of resection demonstrates the potential aggressive nature of primary splenic tumours. This case further emphasizes the caution that must be taken if conservative management of a splenic haematoma is considered.\n\n【51】CONSENT\n\n【52】As the patient died， the family have given permission for publication of this case report.

Considering the patient's age and medical comorbidities， he was started on imatinib 400 mg once daily.

It is a my-eloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) with an estimated incidence of 1.9 cases per 100，000 adults and a death rate of 0.3 cases per 100，000 adults recorded in 2019 in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is characterized by the presence of fusion between the Abelson murine leukemia (ABL1) gene on chromosome 9 and the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene on chromosome 22， leading to the expression of the oncoprotein BCR-ABL1. The derived chromosome is termed Philadelphia chromosome. BCR-ABL1 is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that pro-motes growth and replication through downstream signaling pathways involving RAF， RAS， JAN kinase， STAT， and MYC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Other MPNs include polycythemia vera (PV)， essential throm-bocythemia (ET)， and primary myelofibrosis (PMF)， which are collectively known as Philadelphia-negative MPNs. Diagnostic criteria for all MPNs have been developed by the World Health Organization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The presence of recurrent genetic muta-tions is central to diagnosis. JAK2 mutation is the most com-mon mutation detected in Philadelphia-negative MPNs， which also causes cell proliferation through the JAK-RAS-STAT path-way 4\\].JAK2 mutations are present in up to 95% of PV cas-es and 65% of ET and PMF cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. BCR-ABL1 and JAK2 mu-tations are thought to be mutually exclusive， but recent data and case reports have described cases in which these muta-tions occur concomitantly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-13\\]</u>. In this report， we describe\n\n【39】a unique coincidence presentation of CML and JAK2-positive thrombocytosis one month after initiating tyrosine kinase in-hibitor (TKI) therapy.\n\n【40】Case Report\n\n【41】A 68-year-old man was referred to the hematology clinic be-cause of an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count. He was di-agnosed with type Il diabetes mellitus and hypertension， after which he developed retinal hemorrhage. Prior to retinal laser photocoagulation， he was found to have a high white blood cell count. He was started empirically on hydroxyurea (500 mg once daily) and was referred to the clinic for further evalua-tion. Physical examination revealed splenomegaly (spleen size：13 cm). His initial complete blood count (CBC) revealed the fol-lowing： hemoglobin (Hb)， 14.1 g/dL； WBCs， 34.6x10°/L； plate-lets， 539x10/L； basophils，0.34x10°/L； eosinophils， 0.85×10°/L； and neutrophils， 27.47×10/L Bone marrow biopsy showed hypercellular marrow (cellularity estimated at 100%) with in-creased tri-lineage hematopoiesis， prominent megakaryopoi-esis， and increased reticulin staining. The percentage of blasts was <1% as shown in Figure 1. Fluorescence in situ hybridiza-tion (FISH) analysis of the bone marrow was positive for BCR-ABL1 in 66/100 cells， with Table 1 showing only 1 fusion sig-nal， 1 signal for bcr， and 2 signals for abl， which indicates BCR/ABL rearrangement， representing a Philadelphia translocation with loss of 1 BCR copy and Figure 2 showing 2 Green (BCR)，\n\n【42】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) showed\n\n【46】that the percentage of BCR-ABL1 was 12%. Considering the patient's age and medical comorbidities， he was thus started on imatinib 400 mg once daily.\n\n【47】After 1 month of therapy， the patient's WBC count normalized and BCR-ABL1 percentage by RT-qPCR decreased to 9.5%， but his platelet count increased to 1543×10/L Repeat bone mar-row biopsy was negative for accelerated phase/blast phase CML. Further tests showed that JAK2 V617F mutation was pos-itive， and the genomic DNA from the material obtained was screened with the Mutascreen Kit from IPSOGEN for presence of the mutation c. 1849G<T (p.V617F). Exon 14 of the Janus Kinase 2 gene (JAK2) was analyzed using real-time PCR. The measured results were compared with a reference sample， but the allele burden was not assessed. Tests for acquired von Willebrand disease yielded negative results. He was then start-ed on aspirin 81 mg and hydroxyurea 500 mg once daily， which was later increased to 1000 mg daily. Throughout his treat-ment， the patient achieved all the CML treatment milestones， and he achieved a major molecular response after 6 months of treatment. His platelet count decreased to 400-500×10/L， but his spleen remained enlarged at 13 cm. During follow-up， the patient remained in major molecular response with unde-tectable levels of BCR-ABL1.\n\n【48】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3. Chromosomal analysis revealed the presence of variant Philadelphia chromosome as a result of 3-way translocation between the long arms of chromosome 4，9 and 22 at bands 4q31，9q34， and 22q11.2 .</u>\n\n【49】The JAK2 V617F and BCR-ABL1 oncogenes are thought to be mutually exclusive； however， rare cases have been reported in which the occurrence of one may precede the occurrence of the other. Several attempts have been made to identify the prevalence of concomitant BCR-ABL1 and JAK2 mutations in patients with MPNs. Pieri et al tested 314 patients with BCR-ABL1-positive CML and found that 8 of them (2.5%) had the JAK2 V617F mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Martin-Cabrera et al reported that among patients diagnosed with a myeloproliferative neoplasm by the presence of either JAK2 V617F， BCR-ABL1， or MPL mu-tations， 0.2% were found to be positive for both JAK2 V617F and BCR-ABL1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. More recently， Soderquist et al reported a0.4% prevalence of concurrent JAK2 V617Fand BCR-ABL1 mu-tations when concomitant testing was performed on all pa-tients suspected to have underlying MPN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【50】In our literature review of case reports， the diagnosis varied among CML preceding an MPN， an MPN preceding CML， or the co-existence of both disorders simultaneously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，12\\]</u>. The ma-jority of the reviewed cases were initially diagnosed with MPN， ET， PV， or PMF， and had a JAK2 V617F mutation and later de-veloped CML. The time from diagnosis of CML to MPN varied， ranging from 2 to 18 years after the initial diagnosis. The av-erage duration from the diagnosis of MPN to CML later is lon-ger than that from the diagnosis of CML to MPN later (7 vs 2years) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，16，17\\]</u>. Although JAK2 and BCR-ABL were consid-ered mutually exclusive drivers of mutation， it was repeatedly reported in the literature that they can co-exist. A case series by Soderquist et al indicated that both mutations can present in various manners18-20\n\n【51】Several theories attempt to explain the occurrence of both mutations simultaneously. One theory suggests the existence of 2 separate clones， in which one clone is suppressed by the proliferation of the other clone. Another theory suggests that there is a single clone that includes a relatively smaller sub-clone with both mutations. Other theories point to the possi-bility of a single clone harboring both mutations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21-25\\]</u>. Ping et al proposed that the JAK clone will usually achieve domi-nance once the BCR-ABL clone is suppressed， although their patient had a recent diagnosis of PV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【52】References：\n\n【53】1\\.

It is likely that these 2 mutations exist in different clones， and once the CML clone is suppressed，the JAK2 V617F clone becomes more active. The patient responded well to TKl and cytoreductive (hydroxyurea) therapy. The other options would include combining TKI and JAK inhibitors in such cases.\n\n【58】The limitations in our case report include not measuring the JAK2 V617F allele burden and inability to perform more com-plex testing for clonality， as we believe it is important to dif-ferentiate between clonal evolution vs selection.\n\n【59】Conclusions\n\n【60】Although BCR-ABL1 and JAK2 mutations are thought to be mutually exclusive， cases with co-existence of both mutations and acquiring new mutations have been reported. Physicians must suspect the presence of one of the MPNs in CML pa-tients with persistent or increased thrombocytosis， an atypi-cal course of the disease， or hematological abnormalities de-spite evidence of response or remission of CML Therefore， testing for JAK2 should be performed. Combining cytoreduc-tive therapy with TKl is a therapeutic option when both mu-tations are present， and TKI alone is not sufficient to control peripheral blood cell counts.\n\n【61】Acknowledgements\n\n【62】We thank Ms. Heba Hashem， Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine， Ministry of the National Guard-Health Affairs， Jeddah， Saudi Arabia for her kind help and review in this case.

Nowadays， in order to increase its psychotropic effect， various substances are being added constant-ly to it to promote its potency that might hold toxic effects to different organs including the heart and might lead to other unreported complications such as myopericarditis. Herein， we are presenting a unique case of re-current myopericarditis after the consumption of contaminated marijuana， an association that has not been reported in literature before.\n\n【22】Case Report：\n\n【23】A 29-year-old man presented to our institution with pressure-like left-sided chest pain that is aggravated by cough and deep inspiration and relieved by sitting and leaning forward. Examination revealed pericardial rub and workup showed elevated white blood cell count， C-reactive protein and troponin I level of 2.99 ng/ml. ECG upon admission showed ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads with PR-segment depression. Echocardiogram revealed only concentric hypertrophy. Patient was admitted to another institution with similar symptoms 2months earlier. Patient admitted to using adulterated Marijuana on both occasions prior to hospitalization. Review of medical records from the outside hospital revealed similar ECG and laboratory findings. Treatment with Ibuprofen resulted in resolution of patient’s symptoms and ECG abnormalities.\n\n【24】Conclusions：\n\n【25】Recurrent myopericarditis in our patient is likely the result of consumption of contaminated Marijuana. Careful history taking in patients presenting with myopericarditis is crucial as it might be the causal link.\n\n【26】MeSH Keywords： Chest Pain· Pericarditis · Marijuana Abuse - complications· Myocarditis\n\n【27】Full-text PDF http：//www.amjcaserep.com/download/index/idArt/889808\n\n【28】The consumption of recreational drugs has reached epidemic proportions. Cannabis is the most commonly used illegal sub-stance worldwide. Roughly 160 million people between the ages of 15 and 64 years used cannabis at least once in 2004， repre-senting 4 percent of the world's population. Approximately，45million European Union citizens have used cannabis at some time， with proportionately higher use among younger people通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Unfortunately， for marketing purposes there has been an increase consumption of the so called “grit weed\" which harbors a wide variety of substances that promotes and en-hances its psychotropic effects and potency. Forinstance， there have been reports of tiny glass beads added to marijuana in order to add bulk and to mimic the crystalline appearance of the resin glands， which contain large amounts of delta-9-tet-rahydrocannabinol (THC). Other substances found， have been sand，sugar， micro contaminants， industrial etchant solutions， phencyclidine and tobacco 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. Currently， it is well established that the use of marijuana causes tachycardia， increase in the blood pressure and in rare situations the precipitation of an acute myocardial infarction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>； however there has not been any report to date of any case of myopericarditis related to the use of marijuana.\n\n【29】Here we present an interesting and first ever reported case of a 29-year-old man who presented with chest pain on two dif-ferent occasions in different hospitals after the consumption of contaminated marijuana.\n\n【30】Case Report\n\n【31】A 29-year-old healthy Hispanic man presented to our emer-gency department complaining of pressure-like non-radiating chest pain， localized to the left anterior chest wall after being smoking cannabis for the last 3 days. The pain was aggravat-ed by cough， deep inspiration and lying flat and relieved while sitting and leaning forward. He denied， fever， chills， any recent flu like symptoms， diarrhea or being close to sick contacts. He gave a history of a recent admission about 2 months ago prior to this hospitalization at another facility with similar symptoms that started subsequently after using cannabis for 2 days. He was an active runner and his family history was negative for premature coronary artery disease or any other type of heart disease. His social history was remarkable only for consump-tion of cannabis prior to these 2 admissions and he was not taking any medications at home. Furthermore， he denied any past or recent travel outside El Paso， Texas.\n\n【32】In our hospital his vital signs were as follows： blood pressure(115/65mmHg)，heart rate (69 beat per minute)， Temperature(36.9 degrees Celsius)， respiratory rate (17 per minute) and\n\n【33】Oxygen saturation at room air (98%). Physical exam revealed pericardial rub， more prominent while lying in left lateral de-cubitus position. The rest of cardiovascular examination， chest X-ray and CT angiography were unremarkable. His lab-oratory findings showed elevated white blood cell count of(17.64×10/pL)， C-reactive protein (6.0 mg/L) and troponin I levels (2.99 ng/ml and 6 hours later peaked to 3.49 ng/ml) with unremarkable lipid profile. Twelve-lead ECG on admission was remarkable for upwardly concave ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads and PR-segment depression . Echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 70% with mod-erate concentric hypertrophy consistent with athlete’s heart. No wall motion abnormalities were seen， in conclusion nor-mal echocardiogram.\n\n【34】Upon further questioning， it was determined that the patient had bought and used adulterated Marijuana from Mexico(Ciudad Juarez) on both occasions requiring hospitalization with similar presentations and the patient denied using this kind of marijuana other than those 2 times. The first event started after 48 hours of consuming cannabis and the second time was after 72 hours of consumption of cannabis. In be-tween both hospitalizations the patient denied using cannabis. Review of his medical records from outside facility described similar ECG findings (no pictures available) with elevated tro-ponins and elevated inflammatory biomarkers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 85 mm/hour) and the patient’s symp-toms at that time resolved gradually after he was treated with Indomethacin. No viral serological studies were performed in both admissions. During the course of this hospitalization the patient remained stable， his symptoms and ECG findings resolved after being treated with ibuprofen thera-py. Finally， given the prompt resolution of symptoms and lack of past family history and risk factors for coronary artery dis ease it was decided not to pursue coronary angiography. The patient was discharged home but he lost follow up in our car-diology clinic afterwards.\n\n【35】Discussion\n\n【36】The use of cannabis is well known to cause cardiovascularef-fects such as tachycardia， increase blood pressure and with higher doses， hypotension， bradycardia and vasodilation of the coronary artery bed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Nonetheless， to our knowledge there is no published literature that mentions the use of cannabis as a cause of myopericarditis. Interestingly， in January 2007， the United Kingdom Health Department issued a public health alert of potential harms associated with smoking contaminat-ed cannabis including sore throat， mouth ulcers， persistent coughs， and tightness in the chest 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. As previously reviewed by McLaren et al.， currently there has been a wide spread of manufactured modified cannabis with the use of pesticides，\n\n【37】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2. Electrocardiogram after lbuprofen treatment showing sinus bradycardia with resolution of the diffuse ST-segment elevation.</u>\n\n【38】solvents， micro glass beads in order to add potency and long psychotropic effect. However， these methods of enhanced can-nabis may entail harmful consequences to user's health 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Finally， in several blogs in the internet， there have been some complaints from marijuana users about the presence of chest tightness or chest pain after the usage of contaminated mar-ijuana or “grit weed\"， this may represent isolated， non-report-ed cases of pericarditis/myopericarditis in the community通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【39】Conclusions\n\n【40】In this particular case， we believe that the cause of myoperi-carditis may be likely related to the consumption of contami-nated or adulterated Cannabis， given the clinical history of us-ing Cannabis and subsequent hospitalization on two occasions\n\n【41】References：\n\n【42】1\\.

Finally， we recommend obtaining history of Marijuana usage with every admission of patients presenting with symp-toms of myopericarditis， as this might be a causal link. Cannabis perse may not be related to the cause of pericarditis but adul-terated or contaminated Cannabis may play a role.\n\n【47】Limitations of the case report\n\n【48】To our acknowledge， there has not been reports of myoperi-carditis related to Marijuana； and since most of the cases are presumed to be viral-related， extensive work up for this con-dition is usually not sought such as serum viral antibodies. Nonetheless， given the history of this patient in two sepa-rate occasions in relation with contaminated and adulterat-ed Marijuana should raise suspicion for a causal association.\n\n【49】4\\.

Histological examination of core needle biopsy specimens led to a pathological diagnosis of synovial sarcoma.

At 5 months after surgery and 2 months after the completion of radiation therapy， she developed an insufficiency pathological fracture of the proximal tibia without any apparent trauma.

We re-port a case of radiation-associated insufficiency fracture of the tibial plateau after surgery and RT for synovial sarcoma of the calf that was successfully treated with LIPUS.\n\n【26】A 52-year-old Japanese woman with no significant medical his-tory presented with a slowly growing and painful mass over her proximal calf. Her height and weight were 146.9cm and57.2kg， respectively. Her body mass index was 27.67 kg/m². Her physical examination revealed a hard， tender， palpable6x5 cm mass with moderate mobility under the right proxi-mal calf without restriction of right knee range of motion. On laboratory testing， serum calcium and phosphorus and renal and liver function were within normal limits. Plain radiographs of the right knee showed no abnormalities caused by the soft tissue tumor or osteoarthritis . The lesion，measur-ing 72x22x17 mm on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)，ap-peared as a tumor with clear margins in the popliteus muscle. The lesion had low and high signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted images， respectively . Mild internal enhance-ment was observed on gadolinium-enhanced fat-suppressed T1-weighted images . Chest computed tomography(CT) revealed no apparent lung metastasis (data not shown). CT-guided core needle biopsy was performed. Histopathology findings were consistent with synovial sarcoma， monophasic type . Polymerase chain reaction showed SS18-SSX1\n\n【27】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

After 3 courses of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with ifosfamide and doxorubicin hy-drochloride， we performed surgery.\n\n【31】Preoperative imaging showed no apparent bone invasion. Therefore， the entire popliteus muscle and the adjacent tib-ial periosteum were resected. Although we assumed that a negative-margin RO resection was achieved， the lesion was in close proximity to the tibial artery and nerve. The postopera-tive clinical course was uneventful\n\n【32】After 2 courses of adjuvant chemotherapy with ifosfamide and doxorubicin hydrochloride， adjuvant RT was administered， with a total of 60 Gy in 30 fractions . Approximately5 months after surgery and 2 months after completion of RT， she revisited our outpatient clinic reporting moderate pain in the right knee without any apparent trauma. Plain radiographs showed no obvious abnormal findings . However， MRI revealed transverse bone marrow edema with low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images in the proximal medial tib-ia， indicating an insufficiency pathological fracture caused by RT . We assumed that this insufficiency fracture re-sulted from the stripping of the periosteum from the proxi-mal tibia and adjuvant RT. We also assumed that this would be a refractory fracture. For conventional tibial plateau frac-tures， internal fixation with locking plates using the minimal-ly invasive percutaneous osteosynthesis technique could be\n\n【33】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4.

However， we were concerned about postoperative complications such as deep infection because the surrounding soft tissue would be also compromised from RT. Therefore， we decided to use a conservative non-surgical treatment.\n\n【35】The patient was treated with LIPUS generated by a sonic accel-erated fracture healing system (SAFHS Exogen， Teijin， Tokyo， Japan) 20 minutes daily for 1 year. In addition to LIPUS， she started non-weight-bearing walking for the first 3 weeks. She was allowed to gradually increase partial weight-bearing as long as she remained pain-free for next 7 months. In particu-lar， initially she only performed partial weight bearing starting at 30% of her body weight for 3 months， and steadily built up to full weight bearing as tolerated for the next 4 months. In total， she was able to walk without crutches at 8 months after initiation of LIPUS therapy. Local tenderness resolved within 6months. Radiographs taken 3 and 6 months after LIPUS demon-strated intramedullary callus around the transverse fracture line in the proximal medial tibia . Restoration of the trabecular structure was eventually observed without obvious collapse of the articular surface . Knee pain had completely disappeared 1 year after initiation of LIPUS therapy. MRl showed that the low-intensity area on T1-weighted images  and the high-intensity area on short TI inversion recovery (STIR) images both decreased in size over time. No tumor local recurrence or distant metastases were found dur-ing 24 months of follow-up. The timeline of the clinical course is summarized in Figure 7.\n\n【36】Discussion\n\n【37】Many lines of evidence suggest that adjuvant RT reduces lo-cal recurrence rate in the setting of limb-sparing surgery.

While prophylactic intra-medullary nailing is a common approach for preventing radi-ation-associated fractures， especially in the diaphysis of long bones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， it has been suggested that prophylactic nailing should not be routinely performed because the risk of frac-ture is low. Theoretically， minimally invasive techniques such as stabilization with locking plate augmentation could be ap-plicable to any type of tibial plateau fracture. However， there have been no reports that such methods could prevent the col-lapse of the articular surface in the case of a radiation-asso-ciated fracture. In addition， we must be careful because deep infection rates up to 20% after surgery have been reported for radiation-associated fractures in some series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，8\\]</u>. Therefore， a simple and easy method to accelerate radiation-associated fracture healing must be developed.\n\n【40】Adverse effects of ionizing radiation are histologically consis-tent with decreased osteocyte counts， suppressed osteoblas-tic activity， and diminished vascularity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>， which lead to impairment of bone regeneration at a fracture site.

It can be caused by traumatic as well as non-traumatic factors such as drugs， toxins， and infections. Although it has been initially associated with only trau-matic causes， non-traumatic causes now appear to be at least 5 times more frequent. In rhabdomyolysis， the CK levels can range anywhere from 10 000 to 200 000 or even higher. The higher the CK levels， the greater will be the renal damage and associated complications.\n\n【24】We present the case of a patient with exceptionally massive rhabdomyolysis with unusually high CK levels(nearly 1 million) caused by combined etiologic factors and complicated with acute renal failure.\n\n【25】Case Report：\n\n【26】A 36-year-old African American male patient with no significant past medical history and a social history of co-caine and alcohol abuse presented with diarrhea and generalized weakness of 2 days’duration. He was found to be febrile， tachycardic， tachypneic， and hypoxic. The patient was subsequently intubated and admitted to the medical ICU. Laboratory work-up showed acute renal failure with deranged liver functions test results， and elevated creatine kinase of 701，400 U/L. CK levels were subsequently too high for the lab to quantify Urine le-gionella testing was positive for L pneumophitia serogroup 1 antigen and urine toxicology was positive for co-caine. The patient had a protracted course in the ICU. He was initially started on CVH， and later received in-termittent hemodialysis for about 1 month.\n\n【27】Conclusions：\n\n【28】In the presence of multiple etiologic factors， rhabdomyolysis can be massive with resultant significant morbid-ity. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for rhabdomyolysis in the presence of multiple factors， as early recognition of this diseases is very important in the prevention and active management of life-threaten-ing conditions.\n\n【29】MeSH Keywords： Acute Kidney Injury· Cocaine·Creatine Kinase · Legionnaires' Disease·Rhabdomyolysis\n\n【30】Full-text PDF http：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/905089\n\n【31】口11031 既1 山1 康国9\n\n【32】Rhabdomyolysis is a clinical syndrome characterized by ele-vated serum creatine kinase (CK) and other serum muscle en-zymes. It can be a life-threatening condition due to associat ed conditions such as acute renal failure， severe electrolyte abnormalities， and acid base disorders.\n\n【33】The hallmark of rhabdomyolysis is elevated CK levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The mean peak CK reported for each of a variety of different causes and for patients with both single and multiple causes ranged from approximately 10 000 to 25 000 in the largest case se-ries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Common causes are trauma， muscle compression， hy-perthermia， drugs and toxins like cocaine. Among infectious causes， legionella is a known bacterial cause of rhabdomyol-ysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The exact underlying mechanism involved in alcohol-induced rhabdomyolysis is unknown. Prolonged immobility and coma in short-term alcohol intoxication， and electrolyte abnormalities and acid base imbalances in long-term alcohol abuse have been implicated in causing rhabdomyolysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>. It can also be due to the direct toxic effects of ethanol on the skeletal muscles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Prolonged vasoconstriction with resul-tant muscular ischemia， prolonged immobility， and compres-sion or muscular hyperactivity with resultant secondary muscle injury are believed to be the underlying causes in cocaine-in-duced rhabdomyolysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.Legionella-induced rhabdomyoly-sis is thought to be due to endotoxins or exotoxins and direct bacterial invasion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【34】We report the case of a patient managed for massive rhab-domyolysis with unusually high CK levels of greater than701，400 U/L， resulting in acute renal failure， severe electrolyte abnormalities， significant acid base disturbances， and a pro-longed hospital stay. Alcohol， cocaine， and legionella infection were the causative factors for severe rhabdomyolysis in this critically ill patient. The purpose of this article is to highlight the combined effect of multiple causative factors in rhabdo-myolysis and the associated morbidity.\n\n【35】Case Report\n\n【36】A 36-year-old African American male patient with no significant past medical history presented with diarrhea and generalized weakness of 2 days' duration. He reported drinking 4 pints of vodka daily and regular use of cocaine. His last alcohol drink was 3 days prior to hospital admission， at which time he also took an unspecified amount of cocaine. He reported no sim-ilar episodes in the past. He was not on any medications at home. On physical examinations， he was found to have a tem-perature of 102°F (38.9°C)， blood pressure of 138/94， pulse of125 bpm， respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute， and oxy-gen saturation of 98% on room air. He was drowsy but easily\n\n【37】arousable. He was tachypneic with normal bilateral vesicular breath sounds， tachycardic with regular rhythm， no JVD， and no pedal edema. His abdomen was soft， non-tender，and non-distended， with no organomegaly and neurologic examination was significant for reduced power (3/5) in all his extremities with normal sensations.\n\n【38】While in the Emergency Department， he became more tachy-pneic， tachycardic， and hypoxic and was intubated on the day of admission (7/12). He was started on fluids and broad-spec-trum antibiotics as per sepsis protocol and admitted to the medical ICU， where he was noted to be oliguric with a urine output of only 100 ml of muddy brown urine after initial vig orous fluid resuscitation.\n\n【39】In the ICU， patient was being managed for acute hypoxic re-spiratory failure secondary to legionella pneumonia sep-sis， acute renal failure， severe electrolyte abnormalities， and acid base disturbances secondary to massive rhabdomyoly-sis. Laboratory work-up results are shown in Table 1. Initial chest X-ray was normal but the repeat X-ray  on day2 of hospital admission showed new right lower-lobe consol-idation. Echocardiography showed both diastolic and systolic dysfunction with trace pericardial effusion， and EKG showed sinus tachycardia with right atrial enlargement.\n\n【40】Patient was started on CVVH (Continuous Venovenous Hemofiltration) on day 2 of hospital stay (7/13) of hospital admission， with some improvement in renal function. He was extubated 4 days later (7/16). Despite Initial improvement， he continued to have persistent acute kidney injury with no sig-nificant renal recovery， large extracellular fluid volume， and re mained oligo-anuric； therefore， a decision was made to start the patient on intermittent hemodialysis on day 7(7/20). He remained in the ICU for a total of 8 days， after which was trans-ferred to general medicine floor. Patient was discharged home after about a month， at which time he was clinically stable with stable renal panel and normal creatine kinase levels.\n\n【41】Discussion\n\n【42】Rhabdomyolysis can be induced by many different causes， but it is usually the result of multiple contributing factors.Although it was initially associated almost exclusively with traumatic conditions， non-traumatic causes now appear to be at least 5times more frequent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【43】Clinically， patients may be symptomatic or totally asymptom-atic.

What is unique about this case is that the combination of these could be a reason for the exponential rise of creatine kinase， resulting in severe morbidity and protracted hospital course. The other important point to note in this case is that acute renal failure could have been easily attributed to other factors like sepsis， severe de-hydration， shock， or medication， and rhabdomyolysis-induced acute renal failure could have been easily missed if CK lev-els were not checked. Such comorbid conditions increase the risk of death. It is therefore important that， in the presence of\n\n【52】these risk factors， and in appropriate clinical settings， CK lev-els should be checked early to detect rhabdomyolysis.\n\n【53】Conclusions\n\n【54】Rhabdomyolysis caused by multiple factors is associated with exceptionally high CK levels.

It is an anaerobic gram-negative rod that is normally found in the oral cavity， gastrointestinal tract， genitourinary system， and skin， and thus is rarely isolated from the musculoskeletal system. Risk factors for B. fragitis NJSA include in-flammatory arthritis， malignancy， sickle cell disease， and ischemic heart disease.\n\n【28】Case Report：\n\n【29】Conclusions：\n\n【30】We discuss a case of a 65-year-old man with coronary artery disease， heart failure， chronic kidney disease，and gout， who presented with 5 days of right knee pain， redness， swelling， and warmth. His history included a cor-ticosteroid injection in the affected knee 2 months prior to presentation. The patient was febrile with a palpa-ble right knee joint effusion on exam. Labs were significant for leukocytosis and elevated inflammatory mark-ers. Synovial fluid was aspirated， which was diagnostic for septic arthritis， with cultures growing B. fragitis. Blood cultures were negative， so the infection was attributed to the prior joint injection. The patient was sub-sequently taken to the operating room for irrigation and debridement. He was started on metronidazole， but he unfortunately left against medical advice before treatment was complete and was lost to follow-up thereafter. B. fragitis NJSA most often occurs in the setting of bacteremia or contiguous spread from a concomitant infec-tion. Management involves antibiotics such as metronidazole and surgical drainage. Due to the paucity of data on an infection such as in the present case， the optimal duration of metronidazole is not well-established.\n\n【31】Keywords： Arthritis， Infectious ·Bacteroides fragilis · Knee Joint\n\n【32】Ful-text PDE https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/934266\n\n【33】十1670 1 ￥17\n\n【34】Native joint septic arthritis (NJSA) is an uncommon condi-tion， with an incidence rate of 12/100 000 person-years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

B. fragilis NJSA is more often attributed to hematogenous spread， with detection of B. fragilis in the blood65% of the time 4.\n\n【35】B. fragilis is an obligate anaerobe and gram-negative rod that is typically isolated from the oral cavity，gastrointestinal tract， genitourinary system， and skin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Clinically significant in-fections caused by B. fragilis have been found in many areas throughout the body， including intra-abdominal， intestinal， hepatobiliary， skin and soft tissue， blood， lung， urinary， gyne-cologic organs， brain， cerebrospinal， oral， cardiac valve， and bone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Risk factors for B. fragilis infection include inflam-matory arthritis， malignancy， sickle cell disease， and ischemic heart disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【36】We report a case of B. fragilis NJSA， which we attribute to di-rect inoculation from a prior knee injection in the setting of negative blood cultures， in a patient with multiple risk fac-tors， including cardiac disease， kidney disease， and diabetes.\n\n【37】Case Report\n\n【38】A 65-year-old man with a complex past medical history， in-cluding coronary artery disease with stent， heart failure， atri-al fibrillation， sick sinus syndrome with a pacemaker， chronic kidney disease， diabetes mellitus， gout， asthma，hypertension， obstructive sleep apnea， anxiety， and prostate cancer status post prostatectomy， presented to the emergency room with a chief concern of 5 days of right knee pain associated with red-ness， swelling， and warmth. His symptoms had progressive-ly worsened such that he was unable to bear weight on the affected leg. He denied any fevers or chills. Of note， 2 weeks prior to his presentation， he sought care for a gout flare of his right knee and was given colchicine and prednisone. He had undergone steroid injections in the right knee every 3 months， the last of which was 2 months prior to the current presenta-tion. He denied intravenous drug use. His medication list in-cluded albuterol， fluticasone-vilanterol， linaclotide， losartan，\n\n【39】amlodipine， famotidine， montelukast， furosemide， glipizide， clonazepam， pantoprazole，evolocumab， and febuxostat.\n\n【40】His vital signs included a temperature of 38.5℃， heart rate of80 beats per minute， blood pressure of 137/73mmHg， respi-ratory rate of 16 breaths/minute， oxygen saturation of 98% on room air， and weight of 92.2 kilograms. His physical exam was remarkable for a right knee that was erythematous， warm， and swollen， and was exquisitely tender to palpation. The patient was unable to tolerate passive range of motion. The remain-der of the joints assessed were unremarkable. Auscultation of his heart revealed an irregularly irregular rhythm but was oth-erwise negative for murmurs.\n\n【41】Notable lab results included a white blood cell count (WBC) of 16.7 K/cumm (reference range 4.5-10 K/cumm) with 78%neutrophils and 1% bands， hemoglobin 12.7 g/dL (reference range 13.5-16.5 g/dl)， blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 48 mg/dL(reference range 8-20 mg/dL)， creatinine 1.86 mg/dL (reference range 0.64-1.27 mg/dL)， c-reactive protein (CRP) 9.15 mg/dL(reference range 0-0.74 mg/dL)， and erythrocyte sedimenta-tion rate (ESR) 49 mm/hr (reference range 0-20 mm/hr). Light brown， purulent synovial fluid from the right knee was ob-tained prior to antibiotic administration and was notable for a nucleated cell count of 218 325 K/cumm (reference range13-180 K/cumm) with 87% neutrophils (reference range 0-25%)， and a red blood cell count of\n\n【42】16 127K/cumm (reference range 0-2000 K/cumm). Sterile spec-imens were sent to the microbiology lab for aerobic and aner-obic screening， revealing no organisms on original gram stain. Cultures plated per hospital protocol on multiple culture me-dia including Blood， Chocolate， MacConkey， and Brucella with H&K (BRUHK) agar showed no growth at 24 h. A radiograph of the right knee demonstrated a small-to-moderate-size joint effusion .\n\n【43】The patient was started on empiric treatment with vancomy-cin and ceftriaxone for septic arthritis. Orthopedic Surgery was consulted for surgical management. The patient was taken to the operating room on hospital day 1 for irrigation and debride-ment of his right knee， without any complications. By hospi-tal day 2， the synovial fluid culture obtained from admission revealed heavy growth of B. fragilis on BRUHK media (Hardy Diagnostics A30)， and subsequent intraoperative cultures grew B. fragilis as well. As such， per Infectious Disease recommen-dations， the patient's antibiotic regimen was changed to in-travenous metronidazole with an eventual plan for a 4-week treatment course on oral metronidazole. The source of infec-tion was attributed to direct inoculation from his prior cor-ticosteroid joint injection， given that he had multiple blood cultures that were negative and no other potential sites of in-fection were identified. Although the patient remained afebrile\n\n【44】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1. Right knee radiograph with joint effusion (star) and soft tissue swelling (arrow).</u>\n\n【45】and his leukocytosis resolved post-operatively， he continued to have pain and swelling with an associated rise in CRP to 25.4mg/dL on hospital day 4. Orthopedic Surgery thus planned for repeat irrigation and debridement， but on hospital day 5，the patient left the hospital against medical advice and unfortu-nately was lost to follow-up thereafter.\n\n【46】Discussion\n\n【47】No controlled trials or observational studies regarding the man-agement of NJSA due to B. fragilis could be found in the lit-erature. As with cases of NJSA due to other organisms， treat-ment of NJSA due to B. fragilis is thought to require drainage of the affected joint in combination with antibiotic therapy.\n\n【48】The optimal means of achieving source control in NJSA in gen-eral remain uncertain. Needle aspiration， arthroscopy，and ar-throtomy have all been explored in the literature， but none of these modalities have demonstrated statistically significant superiority 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Arthrotomy and needle aspiration have both\n\n【49】been employed as modes of source control in cases of NJSA due to B. fragilis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-12\\]</u>. However， this has been shown in some case reports to be insufficient， and 1 case report described the need for hemipelvectomy due to difficulty with achieving ad-equate source control通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【50】In addition， antibiotic selection has varied widely in docu-mented cases of NJSA due to B. fragilis with agents including chloramphenicol，clindamycin， doxycycline，erythromycin， me-ropenem， metronidazole， piperacillin/tazobactam， and tobra-mycin prescribed， both individually and in combination， after synovial fluid culture speciation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-12\\]</u>. Metronidazole is cur-rently the most commonly used antibiotic in this setting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Metronidazole demonstrates excellent in vitro activity against B. fragilis and has been shown to penetrate well into synovi-al fluid， thus making it an extremely viable option for treat-ment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，15\\]</u>. In addition， metronidazole resistance is rare， with>99% of gram-negative anaerobes demonstrating susceptibil-ity to this agent. This demonstrates superiority to alternatives with B. fragilis showing 10-42%，1-22%，and 0-5% resistance to clindamycin， meropenem， and piperacillin/tazobactam， re-spectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Metronidazole is generally well-tolerated， with common adverse effects including nausea， diarrhea， and ab-dominal pain. However， extended courses of metronidazole(longer than 4 weeks) may result in peripheral neuropathy， which is reversible upon discontinuation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【51】The duration of antibiotic therapy in cases of NJSA due to B. fragilis in the literature has ranged from 3 to 16 weeks， where-as 3 to 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy are traditionally recom-mended in the setting of NJSA in general 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Of note， a recent unblinded randomized trial of NJSA patients following surgical management compared a 2-week course of antibiotics with a 4-week course， finding the 2-week course to be non-inferi-or 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. This approach has not yet been attempted in any doc-umented case of NJSA due to B. fragilis.\n\n【52】NJSA due to B. fragilis typically responds well to the therapy outlined above. In the literature， we found documentation of only a single recorded death due to B. fragilis NJSA and a sin-gle case of relapsed disease， both as outlined below.\n\n【53】The documented mortality occurred in a 71-year-old man with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis and NJSA of his right knee and elbow. The patient had additional comorbidities including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease， coronary artery disease， and congestive heart failure， similar to our patient. Prior to his death， the patient had received surgical drainage of the affected joints and antibiotic therapy with ampicillin， chloramphenicol， clindamycin， and tobramycin. No autopsy was performed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【54】The case of relapsed disease occurred in a 44-year-old man with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and NJSA of his right\n\n【55】knee. During his initial hospitalization， this patient received a right knee arthrotomy and a 5-week course of clindamycin following the isolation of B. fragilis in his synovial fluid. The patient was readmitted 3 weeks after discharge for manage-ment of purulent drainage from his right knee， and B. fragilis was again isolated from the patient’s synovial fluid. The pa-tient received surgical drainage of the affected joint and an-tibiotic therapy with a 19-day course of clindamycin followed by a 2-week course of doxycycline. The patient recovered and retained full range of motion in his right knee thereafter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【56】Conclusions\n\n【57】NJSA due to B. fragilis is very rare. It is more common in the setting of B. fragilis bacteremia， occurring in about 65% of cas-es， or in the setting of contiguous spread from another con-comitant infection， occurring in about 25% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.

Subse-quently， he developed ulceration and pain in the left maxillary palatal region， which rapidly extended to left paranasal sinuses and left orbit. The diagnosis of mucormycosis was confirmed histologically from the nasal tissue specimen. The extent of the disease was assessed radiologically with computerized tomogra-phy (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The CT image showed a mass lesion occupying the left paranasal sinuses and orbit. The patient was treated with left radical orbital exenter-ation. The patient reported to the department 3 months after the surgery. Intra-oral examination revealed hemimaxillectomy leading to oroantral and oronasal communication. In addition， a considerable portion of the nasal septum and part of the in-ferior nasal conchae was visible. On palpation， the defect was considerably soft and non-tender.

Given the progressive nature of the disease， there are no specific therapeutic options other than medical treatment for heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and antiarrhythmic management with antiarrhythmic drugs and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation. Case summary： We report the case of a female patient who made her debut with ACM with ventricular arrhythmias at the age of 74. The cardiac magnetic resonance showed biventricular involvement， predominantly right ventricle (RV). A cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)-ICD implantation was performed with sensing/stimulation electrode positioned in the left bundle branch of the His (LBBH). Defibrillation function with a high-voltage bovine electrode was implanted in the posterior interventricular vein of the coronary sinus due to the presence of a thrombus within the apical RV aneurysm that did not resolve despite anticoagulation. Eight months after implantation， left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) improved slightly， from 34%at baseline to 42%， and the patient did not present arrhythmias or HF symptoms. Discussion： Our patient presented the first clinical manifestation of ACM at a much older age than usual for this disease， as most patients are diagnosed before the age of 50. CRT-ICD implantation with physiologic pacing of the LBBH could represent a new therapeutic approach in case of LV involvement with reduced EF and the novel drugs for HFrEF， all of which might improve the prognosis of these patients.\n\n【3】KEYWORDS Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy， Cardiac resynchronization therapy， Physiologic pacing of the left bundle branch， Case report\n\n【4】albinaab81@hotmail.es\n\n【5】Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is inherited cardiomy-opathy that affects 1：5000 people.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> This genetic disorder has an autosomal pattern of inheritance， incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity and is associated with mutations of desmosomal and non-desmosomal genes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.

Regarding treatment， given the progressive nature of the disease， there are no specific options other than medical treatment for heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (EF) and antiarrhyth-mic management with antiarrhythmic drugs and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation.\n\n【7】Case report\n\n【8】A 74-years-old Caucasian woman was admitted to the hospital for symptoms that started two weeks ago， consisting of chest pain and recurrent syncope not related to exertion. As a personal history， it is necessary to highlight the presence of a left bundle branch block (LBBB) studied in 2014 with the performance of an echocardiogram that describes non-dilated ventricles， mild sep-tal hypertrophy， left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) of 55% and normal right ventricle ejection fraction (RVEF)， with no valvular disease or other notable findings. She had no other relevant pathological antecedents or family history of heart disease or sudden cardiac death. Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a ventricular tachycardia (VT) with a heart rate (HR) up to 250beats per minute (bpm) that subsided after administration of an intravenous bolus of 300 mg of amiodarone. After reverting to sinus rhythm， her physical examination was unremarkable with no murmurs， signs of HF， hemodynamic instability， or tissue hypoperfusion. The next ECG  that was performed showed a sinus rhythm with an HR of 93 bpm， with a normal PR interval， and an LBBB with secondary repolarization abnormal-ities. The initial blood test showed hypokalemia of 2.56 mmol per litre， without other hydro-electrolyte alterations， with min-imal elevation of myocardial necrosis enzymes (ultrasensitive troponin I： 59 pg per millilitre)， and normal renal function and hemogram. After potassium replacement and administration of amiodarone， she had no recurrence of VT during admission. The initial echocardiogram showed non-dilated ventricles， with mild septal hypertrophy， LVEF of 35% and RVEF severely re-duced， without other notable findings. Coronary angiography was performed to rule out the ischemic cause of VTs， showing no coronary lesions. To further assess the aetiology of her cardiomy-opathy， a cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) was also performed that showed non-dilated ventricles， severely depressed RV sys-tolic function with multiple small aneurysms and dyskinetic areas in the inferior and anterolateral wall of the RV (figure 2A：short axis (top)， 4-chamber axis (middle) and RV (bottom) in tele-diastole (left) and telesistole (right). Myocardial mass： 72 g/m2. RV TDV 70ml/m2， RV TSV 51 ml/m2，RVEF 27%. LV TDV 63ml/m2， LV TSV 41 ml/m2， LVEF 34%)， and the presence of a thrombus within the apical aneurysm ， as well as moderately reduced LV systolic function with exten-sive subepicardial fibrosis located in inferolateral walls (figure2C)， findings compatible with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy(ACM) with biventricular involvement. In the presence of intra-ventricular thrombus， ICD implantation was postponed， and an-ticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin at a dose of 1mg/kg bid plus aspirin 100 mg od was started. Two weeks later，\n\n【9】the intracavitary thrombus persisted， so an ICD implantation was performed with sensing/stimulation electrode positioned in the left bundle branch of the His (LBBH)， and defibrillation function with a high-voltage bovine electrode implanted in the posterior interventricular vein of the coronary sinus . The patient evolved favourably during admission， with no arrhythmic recurrence， HF symptoms or complications related to ICD implantation. She was discharged with the following treatment： sacubitril-valsartan 24/26 mg bid， amiodarone 200mg od， carvedilol 6.25 mg bid， and acenocoumarol. A genetic test was performed， and she was found to have a heterozy-gous pathogenic variant in the DSG-2 gene (g.29099821G>A， c.137G>A，p.Arg46Gln)， thus confirming the diagnosis of ACM. Eight months after discharge， the patient had not presented any ventricular arrhythmia (VA) or developed symptoms of HF. She has also presented mild improvement of LVEF up to 42%， without changes in RVEF， under low doses of neuro-hormonal treatment (limited titration due to intolerance to higher treat-ment doses) and CRT therapy ， but with a resolution of RV apex thrombus under anticoagulant treatment.\n\n【10】The patient also had a 72-year-old sister with no cardio-vascular symptoms and no ventricular arrhythmias (VA) who were screened for ACM with a genetic test that was also pos-itive for the same pathogenic variant and evidence of a small aneurysm located in the RV outflow tract， with no RV dilatation or systolic dysfunction.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1：</u>\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】ACM is a progressive genetic disease with fibro-fatty replace-ment of the myocardium. Histological examination reveals is-lands of surviving myocytes interspersed with fibrous and fatty tissue. This fibro-fatty replacement starts from the epicardium and extends toward the endocardium， which results in progres-sive wall thinning， and leads to multiple aneurysms develop-ment， predominantly located in the RV. These findings were first reported in 1982 by Frank Marcus with a case series of 24 patients with RV dysplasia， highlighting the propensity for ventricular arrhythmias通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， and has been included in the classification of the European group for cardiomyopathies since 1994.\n\n【14】In end-stage disease， there is also clinical involvement of the LV， although histologic findings in the LV have been reported in up to 87% of patients with the disease. From a histological point of view， exclusive involvement of the RV or LV has been\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2：</u>\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3：</u>\n\n【17】reported in 13% and 17% of patients， respectively， and biventric-ular disease in 70% of them通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. This condition predisposes to early ventricular arrhythmias (VA) and subsequent development of cardiomyopathy and HF later in the disease通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【18】The average age of presentation is in the fourth decade (36±14years). Over 99% of cases presented in their mid-teenage years or later， beyond the age of 12 years， and about 80% presented\n\n【19】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4：</u>\n\n【20】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5：</u>\n\n【21】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 6：</u>\n\n【22】before 50 years.

Symptomatic HF develops later in almost half of the patients通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Mutations associated with the disease most commonly in-volve the desmosomal proteins， including plakophilin-2 (PKP2) which is the most frequent (46%)， desmoglein-2 (DSG-2) (4%)， desmoplakin (DSP) (3%)， desmocollin-2 (DSC-2) (1%)， and plakoglobin (JUP) (0.5%). Moreover， less often， the cause is a\n\n【24】mutation in non-desmosomal genes， including alpha-T Catherin(CTNNA3)， cadherin-2 (CDH2)， phospholamban (PLN) (5%)， transmembrane protein 43 (TMEM43) (0.2%)， sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 1 (SCN5A)， lamin A/C (LMNA)， desmin (DES)， filamin C (FLNC) and titin (TTN) have been re-ported通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. High-risk mutations for arrhythmic events include LMNA， PLN R14del，TMEM43，RBM20.\n\n【25】Diagnosis of ACM includes the presence of regional or global dysfunction and structural alterations identified by imaging tests， ECG abnormalities， VA， and identification of pathogenic mutation通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Sometimes， reaching the diagnosis of ACM can be challenging， and it may be necessary to perform an endomy-ocardial biopsy. However， it is not routinely recomended given the low sensivity and the risk of free wall perforation. Therefore， it should be reserved for whom the final diagnosis depends on the histologic exclusion of phenocopies. In this case， our patient fulfilled three major criteria， thus confirming the diagnosis of ACM.\n\n【26】ECG diagnostic criteria include right precordial T-wave inver-sions， the presence of epsilon waves， and increased duration of the terminal QRS from the nadir of the S-wave to the end of the QRS when enlarging above 55 mm通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Although our patient did not present ECG alterations suspicious for ACM despite significant RV involvement， these were probably masked by the presence of LBBB.\n\n【27】Our patient presented the first clinical manifestation at a much older age than usual for this disease. Women carrying desmosomal gene mutations have been reported to be at lower risk of expressing the disease， with a lower mortality rate and less incidence of cardiac arrest than men\\[13，14J. The causes of such sex-related penetrance are not yet fully understood. Fur-thermore， DSG2 mutations have been associated with frequent biventricular involvement up to 50% and present a higher risk of developing end-stage heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，16\\]</u>. Our patient pre-sented biventricular involvement， predominantly RV， at the time of diagnosis.\n\n【28】To the present， given the progressive nature of the disease， there are no specific options other than medical treatment for HF with reduced EF and antiarrhythmic management with antiar-rhythmic drugs and ICD implantation. After CRT-ICD implan-tation with physiological pacing of LBBH and starting neuro-hormonal treatment including low doses of sacubitril-valsartan and beta-blockers， our patient presented a slight improvement in LVEF and no recurrence of VA or symptoms of HF at 8 months of follow-up. To our knowledge， this is the first time that CRT-ICD implantation with physiological pacing of the LBBH has been reported in a patient with ACM， showing a slight improve-ment in LVEF and free of cardiovascular events in the follow-up， together with novel medical treatment for HF with reduced EF. Our case highlights another treatment option in case of LV in-volvement with reduced LVEF， such as CRT with physiological pacing of the LBBH， given the significant intramyocardial in-volvement that characterizes this disease but generally with less involvement of the interventricular septum， in addition to the novel drugs for HF with reduced EF， all of which may contribute to improving the prognosis of these patients.\n\n【29】Funding\n\n【30】This work did not receive any grant from funding agencies in the public， commercial， or not-for-profit sectors.\n\n【31】There are no conflicts of interest to declare by any of the authors of this study.\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>References</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

It is a result of uncontrolled hyperactivation of the reticuloendothelial system with a release of a huge amount of proinflammatory cytokines in the blood-stream， causing a cytokine storm. It may be primary due to genetic defects and secondary， triggered by virus-es，bacteria， parasites， lymphoproliferative， and autoimmune diseases. We present a rare case of HLH triggered by leishmaniasis.HLH accounts for only about 1% of all leishmaniasis cases.\n\n【26】Case Report：\n\n【27】The patient was a 40-year-old previously healthy woman， who has been diagnosed with secondary HLH caused by leishmaniasis. A chronic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection was initially mistakenly interpreted as a trigger agent， because Leishmania amastigotes， present on the first bone marrow biopsy， were not recognized. The treatment with cyclosporin A and corticosteroids suppressed the cytokine storm and prevented the develop-ment of complications. Two months later， because of a reactivation of the disease， the patient was referred to a hematologist. A second bone marrow aspiration was performed， in which numerous Leishmania parasites were finally identified.\n\n【28】Conclusions： The aim of this case report is to provide more information about the rare phenomenon of secondary HLH trig gered by leishmaniasis. Early recognition of the syndrome and its triggering agents will improve disease out-comes and prevent unnecessary treatment with immunosuppressive drugs.\n\n【29】Keywords： Adult ·Leishmaniasis·Lymphohistiocytosis， Hemophagocytic\n\n【30】Full-text PDE https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/933012\n\n【31】17 3 0 1 山音首3 19\n\n【32】Leishmaniasis is caused by an obligate intramacrophage pro-tozoa， and 21 Leishmania species have been identified to be pathogenic to humans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

In 1% of all cases， leishmania-sis causes a secondary HLH syndrome.\n\n【34】HLH can occur in all age groups， causing death in 80% of cas-es. The most common triggering agents are bacterial and vi-ral infections， and malignancies (HLH syndrome) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The hy-percytokinemia caused by autoimmune/auto-inflammatory conditions is called macrophage-activation syndrome (MAS).\n\n【35】The exact pathogenesis of the HLH induced by leishmaniasis and its role in parasite survival are unclear. Due to impaired control of infections， the parasites cause hyperactivation of the macrophages or histiocytes and they do not recognize nor-mal and intact blood cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【36】We report the case of a patient who presented with constitution-al symptoms and septic fever. The poor clinical presentation and non-recognition of the protozoa on the first bone marrow biopsy delayed the diagnosis of leishmaniasis and treatment of the cause.\n\n【37】Case Report\n\n【38】A 40-year-old， previously healthy woman presented with a his-tory of fever up of to 40°C， followed by a gradual onset of fa-tigue， myalgia， profuse sweating， and chills for 2 weeks. Her family history was unremarkable. There was no information about co-existing diseases in the patient. She had no history of tobacco smoking or alcohol and substance abuse. She was hospitalized in the Department of Infectious Diseases with a diagnosis of observation sepsis (elevated acute-phase reac-tants， elevated D-dimers， septic fever) .\n\n【39】Any active infections that could have caused her symptoms were excluded. Therefore， she was referred for a rheumatol-ogy consultation 6 days later with progressive pancytopenia and constitutional symptoms and suspected systemic lupus erythematosus due to polyserositis.\n\n| Time frame  | Complete blood  | Reference  | Coagulation  | Reference  | Chemistry  | Reference  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Time frame  | count  | ranges  | Coagulation  | ranges  | Chemistry  | ranges  |\n| Two weeks after  | WBC 4.34×10八  | 3.5-10.5  | DD 20.0 pug/ml  | 0.5  | CRP 163.4 mg/L  | 0-5  |\n| first symptoms， the patient was  | RBC 4.04×1012/  | 4.2-5.4  | PT time 63%  | 70-130  | ALAT 24.4 UA  | 5-40  |\n| admitted to the Department of  | HGB 96.0 g/l  | 120-160  | INR 1.37  | 0.7-1.3  | Amylase 22.0 U/  | 30-100  |\n| Infectious Diseases  | ESR 33mm/h  | 0-15  | PT time 16.2s  | 10-14  | ASAT 76.6 U/  | 5-40  |\n|  | PLT 90×109/  | 140-440  | APTT 30.6 S  | 28-40  |  |  |\n| Six days later，  | WBC 2.85 109/  | 3.5-10.5  | DD 20.0 ug/ml  | 0.5  | CRP 139.3 mg/L  | 0-5  |\n| the patient was hospitalized in  | RBC 3.2 1012/l  | 4.2-5.4  | PT time 61%  | 70-130  | Total protein  | 63-85  |\n| the Department of  |  |  |  |  | 53.5g/  |  |\n| Rheumatology  | HGB 77.0 g/l  | 120-160  | INR 1.4  | 0.7-1.3  | Ferritin 1110.0 ug/l  | 10-120  |\n|  | HCT 0.244八  | 0.36-0.46  | PT time 16.5S  | 10-14  | ASAT 111.4 U/L  | 5-40  |\n|  | PLT 69×109/  | 140-440  | APTT 36.0 s  | 28-40  | ALAT 42.1 UA  | 5-40  |\n|  | ESR 20 mm/h  | 0-15  | FIB 1.92g/l  | 2-4.5  | LDH 1294.0 U/L  | 208-378  |\n| Three days after  | WBC 4.48x10/  | 3.5-10.5  | DD>20.0 ug/ml  | 0.5  | CRP 115.8 mg/L  | 0-5  |\n| last infusion of IVIG(600 mg/kg divided  | RBC 3.35×1012八  | 4.2-5.4  | PT time 68%  | 70-130  | Ferritin 1083.0 ug/l  | 10-300  |\n| in 3 days)  | HGB 80.0 g/l  | 120-160  | INR 1.3  | 0.7-1.3  | ASAT 69.8 U/  | 5-40  |\n|  | PLT 72×109/  | 140-440  | PT time 15.6 s  | 10-14  | ALAT 35.7 UA  | 5-40  |\n|  | ESR 37 mm/h  | 0-15  | FIB 2.48 g/l  | 2-4.5  |  |  |\n\n| Time frame  | Complete blood  | Reference  | Coagulation  | Reference  | Chemistry  | Reference  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Time frame  | count  | ranges  | Coagulation  | ranges  | Chemistry  | ranges  |\n| Three days after  | WBC 3.41×10八  | 3.5-10.5  | DD 19.99 ug/ml  | 0.5  | CRP 101.8 mg/L  | 0-5  |\n| last infusion of MPR (1 g daily for  | RBC 2.96×1012八  | 4.2-5.4  | PT time 75%  | 70-130  | Ferritin 887.0 ug/l  | 10-120  |\n| 3 days)  | HGB 69.0 g/l  | 120-160  | INR 1.21  | 0.7-1.3  | TG 2.35 mmol/l  | 0.30-2.10  |\n|  | PLT 138×109/  | 140-440  | PT time 14.8s  | 10-14  | ASAT 136.5 U/  | 5-40  |\n|  | ESR 66 mm/h  | 0-15  | FIB 2.25g/l  | 2-4.5  | ALAT 59.9 U/  | 5-40  |\n| Three days after  | WBC 5.56x10°/  | 3.5-10.5  | DD 2.06 pg/ml  | 0.5  | CRP 16.0 mg/L  | 0-5  |\n| initiation of treatment with  | RBC 3.88×1012八  | 4.2-5.4  | PT time 103%  | 70-130  | Ferritin 393.0 ug/l  | 10-120  |\n| cyclosporine A 50 mg twice daily  | HGB 92.0 g/l  | 120-160  | INR 0.98  | 0.7-1.3  | LDH 691.0 U/L  | 208-378  |\n| cyclosporine A 50 mg twice daily  | PLT 278×10°/  | 140-440  | PT time 12.6s  | 10-14  | ASAT 54.6 U/  | 5-40  |\n|  | ESR 74mm/h  | 0-15  | FIB 3.22 g/l  | 2-4.5  | ALAT 81.1U/  | 5-40  |\n| Seven days after  | WBC 9.56x109八  | 3.5-10.5  | DD 0.73 ug/ml  | 0.5  | CRP 0.2 mg/L  | 0-5  |\n| increasing the dose of cyclosporine A to  | RBC 4.02×1012/  | 4.2-5.4  | PT time 113%  | 70-130  | Ferritin 80.0 ug/l  | 10-120  |\n| 100 mg twice daily  | HGB 96.0 g/l  | 120-160  | INR 0.93  | 0.7-1.3  | LDH 352.0 U/L  | 208-378  |\n|  | PLT 305×10°/  | 140-440  | PT time 12.1S  | 10-14  | ASAT 24.7 U川  | 5-40  |\n|  | ESR 49 mm/h  | 0-15  | FIB 2.73 g/l  | 2-4.5  | ALAT 45.8 U/  | 5-40  |\n| Two months  | WBC 3.2712/  | 3.5-10.5  | DD 20.0 ug/ml  | 0.5  | CRP 236.1 mg/L  | 0-5  |\n| later： relapse of the disease was  | RBC 3.8512/  | 4.2-5.4  | PT time 80%  | 70-130  | Total protein  | 63-85  |\n| accompanied with  |  |  |  |  | 69.6g/  |  |\n| worsening of the laboratory findings  | HGB 89.0 g/l  | 120-160  | INR 1.16  | 0.7-1.3  | Ferritin 637.0 ug/ml  | 10-300  |\n| worsening of the laboratory findings  | PLT 171  | 140-440  | PTtime 14.3 s  | 10-14  | ASAT 44.6 UA  | 5-40  |\n|  | ESR 80  | 0-15  | FIB 5.37g/l  | 2.0-4.5  | ALAT 20.3 UA  | 5-40  |\n\n【42】ESR- erythrocyte sedimentation rate； WBC - white blue cells； PLT- platelets； HGB-hemoglobin； HCT-hematocrit； MCV-mean cell volume； MCH-mean cell hemoglobin； ASAT - aspartate aminotransferase； ALAT - alanine aminotransferase； TG -triglycerides； LDH - lactate dehydrogenase； PT -time-prothrombin time； INR -international normalized ratios； APTT - activated partial thromboplastin time； DD -D-dimers； FIB -fibrinogen； IVIG -intravenous immunoglobulin； MPR- methylprednisolone.\n\n【43】In the Department of Rheumatology， she presented with a fever of up to 40℃， fatigue， myalgia， profuse sweating， and chills. On physical examination， she appeared to be alert and aware of place and time. She had a fever of up to 38.4℃. The skin was pale and clammy. A lung examination showed tachy-pnea with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. The car-dio-vascular function indicated tachycardia with a frequency of 105 beats per minute， regular rhythm； there were no mur-murs， rubs， or clicks. Blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg. The ab-domen was flat， soft， and non-tender， with physiological bow-el sounds. The CNS and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) were functioning normally. She had normal mental status， mus-cle strength and power， and normal reflexes.\n\n【44】The chest X-ray was normal.

After several new episodes of hemophagocytosis， treatment was started with cyclospo-rine A 50 mg twice daily， and MPR 60 mg lV once daily. Three days later， the dose of cyclosporin A was increased to 100 mg twice daily， which resolved all laboratory abnormalities and clinical symptoms.\n\n【52】After 2 months without any problems， the patient presented again to the Department of Rheumatology with sudden-onset adynamia，tachycardia， fever up to 40℃， and profuse sweating during the night. The physical examination revealed tachycar-dia of 120 beats per minute， hepatosplenomegaly， and subic-teric skin. Hematologic abnormalities were found， similar to those described earlier .\n\n【53】Because of the reactivations of HLH， we referred the patient to Hematology for treatment with etoposide and an assessment of the need of hematopoietic stem-celltransplantation (HSCT). They performed a second sternal puncture， where numerous Leishmania parasites were noted .\n\n【54】Due to the established leishmaniasis， treatment with cyclo-sporine A was discontinued. The patient was started on the antileishmanial agent meglumine antimoniate.

Due to the rarity of the condition and probably a lack of ex-perience， the Leishmania amastigotes were not recognized.\n\n【64】Other life-threatening infections， such as malaria and brucel-losis， were excluded 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，12\\]</u>.\n\n【65】A normal transthoracic echocardiography performed on the14h day after admission excluded the possibility of an infec-tious endocarditis.\n\n【66】Because a pancytopenia developed rapidly in the course of the hospitalization， it was important to exclude a septic condition and lymphoproliferative disease.\n\n【67】Sepsis can cause a toxic suppression of the bone marrow with pancytopenia. The discrepancy between normal ESR and ele-vated CRP， normal procalcitonin levels，negative hemocultures， and episodes of hemolysis followed by hyperpyrexia do not support the diagnosis of sepsis.\n\n【68】A bone marrow biopsy did not confirm a lymphoprolifera-tive disorder.\n\n【69】Because of the pancytopenia， polyserositis， and constitution-al symptoms， we must keep in mind autoimmune conditions such as SLE， rheumatoid arthritis (RA)， and vasculitis. Also， the\n\n【70】patient did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for either SLE or vasculitis (microscopic polyangiitis， granulomatosis with poly-angiitis)， which are the most common triggers for MAS syn-drome. The absence of arthritis， morning stiffness， and nega-tive rheumatoid factor (RF) ruled out an inflammatory arthritis.\n\n【71】After excluding infections and autoimmune and malignant dis-eases， we decided that the patient met the criteria for second-ary HLH， triggered by a chronic re-activated EBV infection with HScore 218 points (western blot and immunofluorescence as-says were not performed).\n\n【72】Two treatment protocols were developed by the Histiocyte Society in 1994 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> and 2004 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The treatment of HLH re-quires an individualized approach， in accordance with the trig-ger factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【73】Considering the pathophysiology of HLH triggered by a re-ac-tivated chronic EBV infection， we initiated a treatment with MPR 3.0 g Ⅳ， divided into 3 days (1 g daily) followed by nor-mal human immunoglobulin 600 mg/kg divided into 3 days. After several new episodes of hemophagocytosis， treatment was started with cyclosporine A 50 mg twice daily and MPR60 mg lV once daily. Three days later， the dose of cyclospo-rin A was increased to 100 mg twice daily， which led to reso-lution of all laboratory abnormalities and clinical symptoms.\n\n【74】One of the most severe complications of HLH， with a high mortality rate， is a diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC). It is seen in 13.6% of patients with HLH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Our patient devel-oped coagulopathy， which could explain the normal ESR. This discrepancy between elevated ferritin， CRP， and normal ESR is very typical for HLH syndrome complicated by coagulation abnormalities .\n\n【75】Owing to the timely application of cyclosporine A in the pres-ent case， the patient did not develop severe coagulation ab-normalities or DIC syndrome.\n\n【76】Because of the reactivations of HLH after 2 months without problems， we referred the patient to Hematology for treat-ment with etoposide and assessment of the need for hema-topoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). They performed a second sternal puncture， where numerous Leishmania para-sites were noted . Another revision of the first bone marrow biopsy was performed by the same hematology team， where the parasites were also recognized.\n\n【77】The criterion standard for the diagnosis of the leishmaniasis is identifying the parasites in the relevant tissues aspirates or biopsies such as bone marrow， spleen， lymph nodes， or liv-er， skin slit smears or biopsies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>， but the sensitivity of the method is low.\n\n【78】Our literature review found 23 cases of Leishmania-related HLH reports in adults over the period of 7 years 通用删除7(英):<u>(2014-2020)</u>. One case of HLH caused by leishmaniasis in a child， who was initially diagnosed with EBV-triggered HLH， was reported by Singh et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>， with findings very similar to those in the pres ent report. In Bulgaria， for the period 1988-2011， there were13 cases of leishmaniasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. To the best of our knowledge， this is the first adult case of HLH triggered by Leishmania to be reported in Bulgaria.\n\n【79】Conclusions\n\n【80】Leishmaniasis and the HLH syndrome caused by it can present with a broad spectrum of atypical signs and symptoms. The scarce clinical presentation， wide differential diagnosis， and rarity of both diseases make them a diagnostic challenge for all clinical specialists.

SPN generally has good prognosis after surgery； however， 10% to 15% of patients have local recurrence or distant metasta-sis. There have been a few reports of successful surgical resection of isolated recurrent tumors after radical re-section and sporadic reports of multiple metastasectomies. Herein， we present a case of recurrent SPN treat-ed by repeated surgeries.\n\n【30】Case Report：\n\n【31】A 49-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with jaundice and right upper abdominal pain. Computed tomography (CT) scanning revealed a 73x43-mm heterogeneous mass in the pancreatic head. We performed a pancreatoduodenectomy and diagnosed SPN. The patient was discharged without any complications and was followed up by CT once every 6 to 12 months. Six years later， a 15x15-mm tumor was detected in Couinaud segment VI of the liver. A liver biopsy showed a pathological match to the pancreatic tumor. We performed a partial hepatectomy， and the pathology report confirmed metastatic SPN. At 8 and 10 years after the initial surgery， the patient underwent further partial hepatectomies for confirmed solitary liver metastases of SPN. The Ki-67 index increased for each metastasis identified (initial tumor， 1.88%； 6 years， 7.38%；8 years， 5.53%；10 years， 11.22%). No further masses were detected， and the patient survived more than 10 years following\n\n【32】surgery.\n\n【33】Conclusions： Despite histological transformation to high-grade malignant disease， repeated aggressive surgical resection led to long-term survival in our patient with SPN.\n\n【34】Keywords： Liver Neoplasms · Neoplasm Metastasis · Pancreatic Neoplasms· Pathology， Surgical·Recurrence\n\n【35】Full-text PDE https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/934798\n\n【36】口11178 H山白3 非119\n\n【37】Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) of the pancreas is rel-atively rare， representing only 1.0% to 2.0% of all pancreat-ic neoplasms. With advances in imaging systems， the num ber of diagnosed SPN has been increasing dramatically over the past decade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Radical surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment for SPN， for which the estimated 5-year survival rate is 96.7% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.Therefore， pancreatic SPN is widely consid-ered a benign disease. However， 10% to 15% of cases are re-portedly aggressive and lead to local invasion and/or metas-tases， and many cases have synchronous metastasis at the time of presentation 3，4\\].\n\n【38】There are a few reports in the literature on the successful sur-gical resection of asynchronous metastasis of SPN following initial radical resection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-6\\]</u>. Conversely， reports of outcomes in patients who have required multiple metastasectomies are sporadic. We present a patient who successfully underwent3 separate liver resections for SPN following the initial radi-cal resection.\n\n【39】Case Report\n\n【40】A 49-year-old woman was referred to our Sapporo City Hospital， a tertiary care hospital， with jaundice for 3 days and right up-per abdominal pain. The patient had no family history of chron-ic illness or other disorders. A physical examination revealed no remarkable findings. Laboratory data showed abnormally elevated levels of total bilirubin (5.8 mg/dL)， aspartate ami-notransferase (185 U/L)， alanine aminotransferase (322 U/L)， alkaline phosphatase (1450 U/L)， and y-glutamyltransferase(1028 U/L). The serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 were within the normal rang-es. Computed tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic reso nance imaging revealed a 73x43-mm heterogeneous mass in the pancreatic head， which led us to strongly suspect SPN in the pancreas . The patient underwent endoscopic nasobiliary drainage to lessen jaundice. Examination of a bile specimen did not reveal any signs of malignancy. We performed a pancreatoduodenectomy in which an 85x60x50-mm tumor with negative margins and only capsular infiltration was re-sected. Gross pathological assessment revealed mainly hem-orrhage and necrosis.\n\n【41】Microscopically， the diagnosis of SPN was made based on the morphological features： bleeding and necrotic components were mixed on the cut surface， and it had a typical pseudopapillary architecture. The tumor cells showed an increased nuclear Cy-toplasmic ratio and cellularity. The Ki-67 index of the tumor was 1.88%.Immunohistochemical staining of the same spec-imen was positive for B-catenin and CD10， which supported\n\n【42】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1. Comuputed tomography showing a 73x43-mm heterogeneo us mass (thick arrow) in the pancreatic head.</u>\n\n【43】the diagnosis . There was no lymphovascular or peri-neural invasion. There patient's clinical course was unevent-ful until the day of discharge. We planned to perform a physi-cal examination， blood test， and CT scan at 6-month intervals for the first 3 years after surgery， and after that， we planned to perform them yearly.\n\n【44】Six years after the initial surgery， a routine follow-up CT scan detected a 15x15-mm well-defined tumor further in the later stage in Couinaud segment VI of the liver， which was growing over time. We suspected tumor recurrence and performed a liver biopsy to differentiate from other tumors. The patholog-ical appearance of the biopsy specimen was similar to that of the pancreatic tumor. Partial hepatectomy was performed， and pathology confirmed the presence of recurrent metastatic SPN. The patient was discharged home 14 days after surgery with-out complications. We changed the follow-up plan to perform a physical examination， blood test， and CT scan every 6 months. Further metastatic tumors were found in the liver at 98 and113 months after the initial surgery， for which the patient un-derwent repeated partial hepatectomies. We found that the Ki-67 index increased every time metastasis occurred， namely1.88%， 7.38%，5.53%，and 11.22%， respectively . The patient developed no further metastases and was alive at the time of reporting， which was 14 years following initial surgery.\n\n【45】Discussion\n\n【46】SPN is classified as a low-grade， malignant epithelial tumor with uncertain cellular differentiation in the 2010 World Health Organization classification. SPN usually develops in young\n\n【47】原\n\n【48】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2. Characteristics of the primary tumor.

However， the 10% to 15% of ag-gressive cases are associated with a lower survival rate than nonaggressive cases and have 5-year and 10-year survival rates of 71.1% and 65.5%， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The factors that lead to recurrence， metastasis， and unfavorable outcomes in patients with SPN remain unclear. Some studies suggest that the following pathological characteristics are associated with tumor aggression： a solid/diffuse growth pattern with exten-sive tumor necrosis， a high mitotic rate (>15 mitoses per 50high-power fields)， pancreatic parenchymal invasion， capsu-lar invasion， extrapancreatic invasion， angioinvasion， nodal metastasis， and Ki-67 index >4%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8-10\\]</u>. However， Kim et al found no significant correlations between angioinvasion， peri-neural invasion， or moderate nuclear pleomorphism and ma-lignant tumor behavior， yet they also noted that the absence of these pathological findings does not exclude aggressive behavior 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Our patient， in whom only capsule infiltration was found following radical resection， had aggressive dis-ease with recurrent metastasis. Interestingly， Watanabe et al\n\n【50】showed that clinically aggressive SPNs have been associated with advanced patient age and this is more likely to reflect a period of tumor growth before resection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. As mentioned above， SPN is common in young women， but our patient was49 years old at first presentation.\n\n【51】The most common sites of metastasis are the liver， regional lymph nodes， mesentery， omentum， and peritoneum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In the literature，the mean time to recurrence is 50.5 months，which highlights the importance of long-term close observation after operative resection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>， although a consensus on the duration of follow-up has not been reached. There is no consensus re-garding chemotherapy and radiotherapy for SPN， but there have been a few reports about the effectiveness of chemotherapy and radiotherapy for SPN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，16\\]</u>； therefore， these modalities might be considered as alternative approaches when surgery is not possible. Surgical resection of metastatic lesions is as-sociated with prolonged survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. This was evident in our case， where we observed an uneventful patient survival after repeated surgical resection for metastatic lesions.\n\n【52】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3. Changes in Ki-67 labeling index， showing an overall increasing trend. (A) Primary tumor. (B) Specimen resected at second surgery. (C) Specimen resected at third surgery. (D) Specimen resected at fourth surgery.</u>\n\n【53】A few reports about successful surgical resection for isolated re-currences of SPN following radical resection exist， but cases in-volving multiple metastasectomies are rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18，19\\]</u>. Interestingly， in the present case，the intervals between recurrences of me-tastases were shortened as the Ki-67 index increased. To the best of our knowledge， this is the first report showing the re-lationship between the Ki-67 index and recurrences of me-tastases over time in a patient with SPN. Watanabe et al sug-gested that SPN can histologically transform from low-grade to high-grade malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Kim et al noted an association between an elevated Ki-67 index and development of distant metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Our findings support the increasing degree of malignancy with recurrent SPN metastases.\n\n【54】SPN is widely viewed as a low-grade malignant disease with favorable prognosis owing to the high success rate of surgi-cal treatment. However， SPN can histologically transform to high-grade malignant disease that gives rise to recurrent me-tastasis. Aggressive surgical resection for repeated recurrent metastatic SPN can improve long-term survival. Further stud-ies of SPN focusing on histological transformation are required to understand this enigmatic disease subtype more clearly.\n\n【55】Declaration of Figures’ Authenticity\n\n【56】All figures submitted have been created by the authors who confirm that the images are original with no duplication and have not been previously published in whole or in part.\n\n【57】1\\.

This report comprises the cases of 3 patients with COVID-19-associated coagu-lopathy who were evaluated with thromboelastography (TEG) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) to enable personalized anticoagulant therapy.\n\n【32】Case Reports： Three patients presented with COVID-19 pneumonia， confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain re-action， who developed thrombohemorrhagic coagulopathy Case 1： A 72-year-old woman on long-term warfa-rin therapy for a history of venous thromboembolism developed a right upper lobe pulmonary embolus， despite an international normalized ratio of 6.4 and aPTT of 120.7 s. TEG enabled successful anticoagulation with hepa-rin， and her pulmonary infarct was no longer present 2 weeks later. Case 2： A 55-year-old woman developed a rectus sheath hematoma while on heparin， and TEG demonstrated increased fibrinolysis despite COVID-19 pa-tients more commonly undergoing fibrinolytic shutdown. Case 3： A 43-year-old woman had significant throm-bus burden while severely hypocoagulable according to laboratory testing. As the venous thrombi enlarged in a disseminated intravascular coagulopathic-like state， the heparin dose was escalated to achieve a target aPTT of 70 to 80 s， resulting in a flat line TEG tracing.\n\n【33】Conclusions： These 3 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia with complex and varied clinical histories demonstrated the clinical val-ue of TEG combined with the measurement of aPTT to facilitate personalized anticoagulation， resulting in good clinical outcomes.\n\n【34】Keywords： Anticoagulants· COVID-19·Heparin· Thrombelastography·Venous Thromboembolism·Hemorrhage\n\n【35】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/931080\n\n【36】H\n\n【37】2088 1 山首：3 28\n\n【38】Anticoagulant dosing in hospitalized patients infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)， the pathogen that causes the novel coronavirus dis-ease 2019 (COVID-19)， remains an area of controversy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. The United States' National Institute of Health expert consensus on COVID-19 therapy currently cites insufficient data for or against the escalation of prophylactic anticoagulation to intermediate or therapeutic dosing for hospitalized patients without radio-graphically proven macrothrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The initial enthusiasm for intermediate or therapeutic doses was based on the high rates of venous thromboembolisms (VTEs)， pulmonary embo-lisms (PEs)， and arterial thromboses in patients with COVID-19， particularly those in the intensive care unit (ICU) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. Despite the known hypercoagulable states of these patients， bleed-ing may occur with standard doses of low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin (UFH) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-8\\]</u>. A major US tri-al for therapeutic anticoagulation in critically ill patients with COVID-19 was recently halted owing to the high incidence of bleeding in patients in the ICU 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Providing the standard lev-el of anticoagulation was an attractive therapeutic hypothesis， which was later shown to be potentially life-threatening 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>.\n\n【39】The thrombohemorrhagic complications of COVID-19 ob-served early in the pandemic prompted us to form a coagu-lation committee tasked with adjudicating anticoagulation to simultaneously reduce the incidence of thrombosis and clinical-ly significant hemorrhage. The viscoelastic hemostatic assays， thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastom-etry (ROTEM)， are attractive tests for hemostatic monitoring because of their demonstrable use across several disciplines， including trauma resuscitation， extracorporeal membrane ox-ygenation (ECMO)， major surgery， obstetrics， and inherited and acquired coagulopathies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10-13\\]</u>. Viscoelastic hemostatic\n\n【40】assays have several advantages over the plasma-based com-mon coagulation tests (eg， activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)， prothrombin time). TEG/ROTEM enable the rap-id identification of the specific disruption in the clotting pro-cess， as well as fibrinolysis， and have proven to be cost-effec-tive for improving patient outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，14\\]</u>. TEG/ROTEM depict a graphical representation of the entire coagulation process using whole blood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. TEG parameters include the reaction time (R)， which represents the time to initial fibrin formation(standard range， 5-10 min). Clot kinetics are represented by clot formation (K)， which indicates the speed of fibrin build up (standard range， 1-3 min)， and the alpha angle (o)， which indicates the speed of clot strengthening (standard range，53-72°). Clot stability is represented by the maximum ampli-tude (MA)， which varies with the strength of the fibrin-plate-let interaction (standard range， 50-70 mm). Lastly， lysis at 30min (LY30) represents fibrinolysis (standard range，0-8%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【41】TEG/ROTEM have demonstrated utility in small studies to identi-fy coagulopathies and manage anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15-19\\]</u>. TEG was selected over ROTEM in our study because of the hospital laboratory's preexisting familiarity in application to trauma and surgery. All 3 cases presented be-low were confirmed positive for COVID-19 by reverse transcrip-tase-polymerase chain reaction assay of nasopharyngeal swabs， based on the World Health Organization standard that targets the SARS-CoV-2 E gene and RdRp gene (BioFire Respiratory 2.1Panel， BioFire Diagnostics， Salt Lake City， UT， USA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20，21\\]</u>. Here， the utility of TEG (TEG 5000 analyzer with reagent kaolin and without heparinase， Haemonetics Corporation， Niles， IL， USA) as an adjunct to aPTT (Sysmex CA-1500 with reagents Innovin and CaCl。 Siemens Medical Solutions， Malvern， PA， USA) is dem-onstrated for 3 patients hospitalized with COVID-19-associated coagulopathy to enable personalized anticoagulant therapy.

Three days after admission， she was diagnosed with a right upper lobe PE， despite an international normalized ratio (INR) of 6.4 and aPTT of 120.7 s (reference range， 23.0-34.0 s) . Intravenous(Ⅳ) UFH of 8 units/kg/h was started. Doppler ultrasound of the upper and lower extremities did not reveal a deep vein thrombus(DVT). The following day， TEG demonstrated severe hypocoagu-lability . The UFH dosage was decreased to 3 units/kg/h. For the next 2 weeks， TEG enabled goal-directed therapy with small doses of UFH from 3 to 5 units/kg/h， the goal being maintenance of the TEG parameter R of 12 to 17 min and aPTT\n\n【47】of 50 to 60 s. It took the duration of these 2 weeks for the INR to decrease to subtherapeutic levels. The patient’s right upper lobe pulmonary infarct was no longer present on repeat imag-ing 14 days after its discovery . On the same day as repeat imaging， TEG demonstrated normal hemostasis， and her aPTT was 25.0 s . The patient was placed on apixa-ban 5 mg twice daily. In this case， there was no attempt to di-agnose lupus anticoagulant or acquired hemophilia A because the severe prolongation of aPTT returned to normal 3 days after withholding warfarin therapy.

Four days after admission， TEG and aPTT demonstrated hypercoagulability， and she was restarted on anticoagulants. IV UFH was chosen over enoxaparin to prevent SQ administration in the abdomen where the rectus sheath hematoma was present. In addition，anti-factor Xa levels were not accessible to monitor enoxaparin. A Doppler ultrasound of the patient's extremities was negative for DVT. For the next 8 days， UFH dosing from 8 to 12 units/kg/h was guid-ed by the TEG to maintain a target aPTT of 40 to 50 s. Twelve days after admission， TEG revealed a LY30 of 28.5%， indicating\n\n【53】fibrinolysis . Concern for an expanding hematoma prompted a decrease in the UFH dosage from 8 to 7 units/kg/h. Fifteen days after admission， repeat imaging of the abdomen revealed a marginal decrease in size of the rectus sheath he-matoma .

A Doppler ultrasound of all4 extremities revealed a right popliteal DVT. She had a platelet count of 37×10/L (reference range， 130-470×10°/L) and fibrin-ogen level of 137 mg/dL (reference range， 180-350 mg/dL) on admission. In addition， her D-dimer level was beyond the up-per limit of the laboratory measurement of 35.2 mg/L (refer-ence range，<0.53 mg/L). She was administered fibrinogen con-centrate and platelets periodically to maintain a platelet count>50x10°/L and fibrinogen >150 mg/dL. She also received a dose of romiplostim (Nplate) to stimulate thrombopoiesis. Subsequent testing for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia by serotonin\n\n【59】release assay and platelet-Factor 4 antibody serology was neg-ative. For the next 7 days， owing to concern for thrombocyto-penia， hypofibrinogenemia， and an elevated D-dimer level， she was administered I UFH doses of 15 to 20 units/kg/h to initial-ly maintain a goal aPTT of 40 to 50 s. The goal was to prevent hemorrhagic manifestation of the thrombohemorrhagic pheno-type while simultaneously escalating anticoagulation therapy. Seven days after admission， computed tomography revealed the development of renal vein thrombosis， inferior vena cava thrombosis， and right external and internal iliac thromboses， despite high dose anticoagulation . With significant thrombus burden， a higher aPTT goal of 60 to 70 s was target-ed， despite a TEG tracing that was nearly a flat line .\n\n【60】Repeat abdominal imaging conducted 18 days after admission revealed enlargement of venous thrombi . A decision was made to further increase the dosage of UFH to achieve a target aPTT of 70 to 80 s， resulting in a severely hypocoagulo-pathic TEG showing a complete flat line . After this final escalation of UFH， a gradual reduction of the D-dimer level and increase in fibrinogen occurred under this regimen for the next 10 days. The patient's hypoxia， dyspnea， and lower limb edema resolved prior to discharge. Repeat imaging to demon-strate clot resolution prior to discharge was not obtained be-cause the patient was asymptomatic， and the family request-ed no further testing owing to finances. Subsequent follow-up revealed that the patient had returned to normal occupational function and had no residual pulmonary or vascular symptoms.\n\n【61】Discussion\n\n【62】These 3 cases demonstrate the utility of TEG in guiding anti-coagulation therapy for complex and coagulopathic critically ill patients with COVID-19 in the ICU. Case 1 represents the util-ity of TEG to guide heparin in a patient where a warfarin-in-duced INR of 6.4 did not prevent the development of a PE as-sociated with COVID-19 pneumonia. Low doses of UFH were administered with the notion that the anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects of UFH would assist in preventing further ex-pansion of the thrombus in the lung 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. The pulmonary 'em-bolus'in this case may be a misnomer since the patient had no VTE on 4-extremity ultrasound. Rather， this was likely a pulmonary immunothrombus caused by the local endothelial inflammation in the pulmonary vasculature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，6，23\\]</u>. The res-olution of the soft clot after 2 weeks of UFH therapy may not only have been due to the direct anticoagulation， but also in-directly due to the anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects of the heparin molecule at the endothelial surface 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.\n\n【63】In Case 2， TEG unveiled fibrinolysis otherwise undetectable by common coagulation tests， enabling the personalized adjust-ment of anticoagulation. It is uncertain whether the excessive fibrinolysis was causative of the hematoma or was a second-ary response to the presence of the hematoma. Severely ill pa-tients with COVID-19 more commonly demonstrate fibrinolytic shutdown， so this TEG pattern should prompt a search for an occult hemorrhage such as in this patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，19，24\\]</u>. Finally， Case 3 demonstrates the immunothrombotic phenotype com-mon in critically ill patients with COVID-19， who may clot de-spite therapeutic levels of anticoagulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，6，7\\]</u>. Informed by the patient's clinical state and assisted by TEG， the aPTT goal was escalated gradually for this patient with significant throm-bus burden， which resulted in complete recovery.\n\n【64】The COVID-19 coagulopathy is dependent on the unique im-munothrombotic changes that occur at the endothelium， which\n\n【65】can cause an endotheliitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>.Although this more selectively involves the lung， it can potentially involve any vascular tissue. As there is infiltration of monocytes and macrophages into in-volved sites， an acute inflammatory response is induced with elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as inter-leukin (IL)-6， IL-1， tumor necrosis factor o， and IL-8 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25，26\\]</u>. In severe cases， the response is to a degree that is described as a“cytokine storm\". These inflammatory cytokines in turn ac-tivate the intrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade， with factor XII activation and progression to thrombin generation. Fibrinolysis is also impaired with upregulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 expression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>\n\n【66】The effect of this cytokine storm on the endothelial surface may cause a pathophysiologic milieu like that found in patients on ECMO， as well as in patients who are post-resuscitative and recovering from trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，28\\]</u>. The persistence of fibrinolytic shutdown in all patients with COVID-19， regardless of whether the patient bled， reflects one of the interesting pathophysio-logic moments that defines the hypercoagulopathy of this nov-el disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19，24\\]</u>. The intensity of required anticoagulation in these patients may be a function of the intensity of inflamma-tion caused by the cytokine storm. As the storm abates， so too does the requirement of higher levels of anticoagulation，sug-gesting the need for intense hemostatic monitoring not just with the aPTT， but also with adjunctive TEG analysis. We have drawn from the experience of ECMO， whereby frequent mon-itoring by a specialized coagulation team follows the clinical pattern of aPTT， anti-factor Xa levels， and TEG to guide anti-coagulation therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. For patients with COVID-19， we uti-lized the same strategy by following biochemical inflammatory markers， D-dimer， fibrinogen， aPTT， and TEG to guide antico-agulation. Notably， we were unable to use anti-factor Xa lev-els owing to limitations at our institution， but in an ideal sit-uation anti-factor Xa levels would also be used to adjudicate UFH therapy. We have found this strategy helpful for our pa-tients， as demonstrated by the 3 examples described above of goal-directed and personalized anticoagulation for patients with COVID-19-induced coagulopathy.\n\n【67】Conclusions\n\n【68】These 3 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia with complex and var-ied clinical histories demonstrated the value of using TEG combined with the measurement of aPTT to facilitate individ-ualized anticoagulation，resulting in good clinical outcomes.\n\n【69】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of Interest</u>\n\n【70】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Mark Walsh reports research grants from Haemonetics Inc.

When patients are lack-ing overt cutaneous manifestations， diagnosis may be delayed and may complicate diagnosis and management of atypical presentations of this disease. It is thus important to strive to obtain relevant and/or complete his-tory to arrive at the appropriate diagnosis. Furthermore， maintaining an index of suspicion in cases of vague abdominal pain may guide the clinician in establishing the correct diagnosis of mesenteric plexiform neurofi-broma in the setting of known/presumed neurofibromatosis 1 patients presenting with acute and/or chronic vague abdominal symptoms.\n\n【20】Case Report： This is a case of a teenage boy who presented with acute， vague abdominal pain over a period of 2 weeks.\n\n【21】Conclusions：\n\n【22】Laboratory tests and physical exam findings in primary and secondary care settings were unremarkable， and thus the patient was discharged home only to continue with abdominal pain， thus seeking additional medical care. After admission to our facility and exhaustive history taking， physical examination， and imaging， a pro-spective diagnosis of neurofibromatosis with mesenteric neurofibroma was made. Upon surgical exploration， a mesenteric mass with corresponding volvulized， ischemic small bowel was removed. Histopathology confirmed a plexiform neurofibroma. The patient recovered adequately and was discharged home without complications. This case highlights the importance of exhaustive history taking to obtain an accurate diagnosis as well as the importance of a high index of clinical suspicion for mesenteric neurofibromatosis in patients with presumed\n\n【23】or known neurofibromatosis and presenting with vague abdominal symptoms.\n\n【24】Keywords： Intestinal Obstruction · Intestinal Volvulus· Neurofibroma， Plexiform·Neurofibromatosis 1\n\n【25】Full-text PDE https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/918041\n\n【26】口22015 H山白\n\n【27】4\n\n【28】1\n\n【29】0\n\n【30】Publisher's note： All daims expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of their affiliated\n\n【31】AP\n\n【32】organizations， or those of the publisher the editors and the reviewers. Any product that may be evaluated in this article， or claim that may be made by its manufacturer， is not guaranteed or endorsed by the publisher\n\n【33】Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a well-documented neu-rocutaneous disorder with protean manifestations. It is well known that this disease is caused by mutation of the gene re sponsible for neurofibromin， an important cell-signaling and growth-regulating protein coded within the long arm of chro mosome 17 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Mutations of the NF1 gene result in altered signal transduction within the Ras oncogene pathway， and the resulting decreased negative regulation results in increased cell proliferation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【34】Classically， the clinical manifestations of NF1 include benign soft-tissue tumors of the skin (neurofibromas) as well as mul-tiple neurocutaneous manifestations such as cafe au lait spots and Lisch nodules. However， manifestations are multisystemic. Within the central nervous system， findings may include white matter/basal ganglia focal areas of increased signal intensity(FASI) as well as a propensity for central nervous system ma-lignancies， notably CNS astrocytomas. Musculoskeletal findings may include decreased muscle mass and muscle work capacity/performance as well as malformations of skeletal structures.\n\n【35】In some instances， atypical presentations of NF1 may be the trigger to identify and diagnose this condition in patients in whom the diagnosis has been delayed. In this case， we present a juvenile patient with a previously unknown diagnosis of NF1presenting to the emergency room with incomplete ileal volvu-lus. An imaging diagnosis of volvulus secondary to a mesen-teric neurofibroma was made with subsequent histopatholog-ical confirmation. To the best of our knowledge， only 3 cases of mesenteric neurofibroma secondary to NF1 have been re-ported in the literature， of which 2 cases demonstrated mes-enteric involvement by a plexiform neurofibroma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-5\\]</u>. This is the second case reported in the literature where a mesenteric plexiform neurofibroma resulted in volvulization of the intes-tine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Our case elegantly demonstrates the adage in medi-cine that proper history taking and physical exam results in a more certain diagnosis. Furthermore， this case highlights that in patients with presumed or known diagnosis of NF1 present-ing with abdominal pain， mesenteric neurofibromatosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis as a potential com-plication of this multisystemic disorder.\n\n【36】Case Report\n\n【37】Our case details a 15-year-old white Hispanic male whose main clinical concern was long-standing， persistent， nonspecific ab-dominal pain， whose prior medical history was significant for gastritis， gastroesophageal reflux (GER)， attention deficit hy-peractivity disorder， and learning disabilities.\n\n【38】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1. Our patient demonstrated the classic cutaneous finding of multiple cafe au lait spots， the largest along the dorsal surface of the right arm.</u>\n\n【39】Initially， the patient was taken from school to the nearest emergency room due to acute onset of periumbilical pain of7/10 intensity associated with nausea. The patient had an un-remarkable physical examination and laboratory test results and was discharged home with subjectively decreased pain. The patient continued to have intermittent bouts of abdomi-nal pain for the following days， unrelieved by bed rest.\n\n【40】Seven days prior to admission， the patient was taken again to the emergency room. Routine laboratory tests and X-rays were once again unremarkable. However， the patient's persis-tent pain prompted transfer to our institution. An abdominal sonogram was performed and was unremarkable. Soon after， the patient was discharged home with a diagnosis of gastritis.\n\n【41】The patient continued to have abdominal pain for the follow-ing week with loss of appetite and poor oral intake while re-maining afebrile. Two days prior to admission， the patient’s abdominal pain worsened and he was taken to another med-ical institution， where laboratory test results were normal and X-rays failed to reveal any abnormal findings. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed and was remarkable at that time for“edema of the small bowel，\"“multiple nodes，\" and a“twisting of the mesenteric layer” but otherwise without ob-struction. At this point， he was transferred to our institution.\n\n【42】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2.

(C， D) Axial images at the level of the pelvis shows nodular， thickened lumbosacral nerve roots(arrowheads).</u>\n\n【43】Further history taking yielded significant findings of prior ad-mission to our institution for GER and poor weight gain， as well as a brain tumor in a 14-year-old maternal cousin diag-nosed at 2 years of age.\n\n【44】On physical exam， the patient had normal vital signs and was in the 11th and 3md percentile for height and weight， respec-tively. Multiple cafe au lait spots were noted， the largest on his right upper arm .\n\n【45】Examination of the abdomen revealed hyperactive bowel sounds and right lower-quadrant tenderness to palpation， with an otherwise soft and depressible abdomen.\n\n【46】The patient was admitted to our institution for pain manage-ment and further workup of abdominal pain. He was consult-ed to our Radiology Department， where review of history and prior imaging was performed. It was determined that the pa-tient needed a follow-up abdominal and pelvic CT scan， in light of findings on prior imaging， to assess interval chang-es and/or resolution.\n\n【47】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3.

Finally， thickening of the lumbosacral nerve roots was noted ， and a prospective di-agnosis of type l neurofibromatosis with mesenteric and lum-bosacral manifestations was made； specifically， mesenteric neurofibromatosis.\n\n【51】The patient was taken to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy， and intraoperative findings revealed a confluent，\n\n【52】dense nodular mass diffusely scattered throughout the distal mesentery and extending to the mesenteric root ， with twisting of a portion of the distal small bowel， compat-ible with imaging findings. Manual untwisting of the bowel was then performed. The untwisted portion of the distal small bowel showed thickened， edematous walls and a dilated lu-men along an amotile bowel segment. In addition to this af-fected small bowel segment， there was additional infiltrative involvement of a significant portion of the remaining mesen-tery and small bowel. Separating the mass from the mesen-tery was determined impossible without significantly risking the associated mesentery and bowel. It was also determined that the extent of the mass throughout the mesentery made it prohibitive to excise as a whole due to the amount of via-ble bowel that would necessarily be resected. It was thus de-termined that partial tumor debulking via partial resection of the affected， symptomatic bowel would be performed， and 36cm of small bowel， associated mesentery， and mass were re-moved . Primary small bowel anastomosis was then performed with subsequent conclusion of surgical procedure.\n\n【53】Surgical gross pathologic inspection of the mesenteric mass disclosed diffuse infiltration of the mesentery by a nodular mass with macroscopic appearance reminiscent of a“bag of worms.\"Microscopic evaluation demonstrated a myxoid ma-trix， containing a network of bundles of Schwann cells with hyperchromatic nuclei， impinging upon and distorting the ad-jacent intestinal microarchitecture， consistent with a plexiform neurofibroma .\n\n【54】Our patient recovered adequately without complications with-in the next few days and was discharged home 5 days after his exploratory laparotomy. Eight months after the procedure， the patient denied recurrence of symptoms.\n\n【55】Discussion\n\n【56】NF1 is a multisystemic disease of variable penetrance. As such， it remains a clinical challenge to accurately predict the true extent of disease.\n\n【57】Patients such as ours presenting without the diagnosis of NF1and with limited cutaneous stigmata are particularly challeng-ing because prospective diagnosis complications of the disease necessitate prior diagnosis of the disease causing the compli-cations. Our patient presented a particular scenario in which relevant clinical information was sought by and made avail-able to our interpreting radiologists and， coupled with imaging findings， allowed our team to not only provide a prospective diagnosis of NF1， but also one of its uncommon complications， mainly incomplete volvulus with resulting low-grade partial small bowel obstruction. As such， we propose that in patients\n\n【58】with known， recent， or presumptive diagnosis of NF1 present-ing with acute or chronic abdominal pain， the clinician should consider the diagnosis of a MPN， including， and not limited to， obstructive etiology that may include a secondary volvu-lus of the small intestine.\n\n【59】Although the differential diagnosis for small-bowel obstruction is extensive， CT findings can help narrow down the list. Our patient presented with an extensive， nodular soft-tissue den-sity mass throughout the mesentery. Fukuya et al suggested that these soft-tissue density nodularities actually represent cross-sectional images of enlarged peripheral nerves. Because these nerves tend to form an interconnecting network， they trap normal peripheral fat among their entangled network. These findings are absent in other retroperitoneal and mes-enteric masses3.\n\n【60】Surgical resection is the preferred treatment for MPNs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. As our case demonstrates， MPNs are prone to mechanical com-plications； these include ulceration and bleeding， obstruction， intussusception， and volvulus， manifestations that increase the risk of subsequent perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Mesenteric vessel encase-ment may also predispose to vascular and lymphatic obstruc-tion， impaired gastrointestinal absorption and systemic man-ifestations such as failure to thrive in pediatric patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Furthermore，transformation of plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) into malignant peripheral nerve-sheath tumor (MPNST) is a well-established complication contributing to significant mor-tality in this patient population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. There are no character-istic clinical， laboratory， or imaging findings that distinguish PNs from other MPNSTs. Rather， distinction is solely based on pathologic examination of the specimen， in which benign PNs are diffusely positive for S-100 protein， whereas MPNSTs are negative or focally positive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. However， imaging findings that may suggest malignant transformation include sudden enlargement of a previously stable mass， marked inhomoge-neities in MR signal intensity， infiltrative margins， and irregu-lar bone destruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Therefore， in anticipation of these complications and malignant transformation， prophylactic sur-gical removal should be considered in asymptomatic NF1 pa-tients with incidental findings that suggest MPNs on imaging.\n\n【61】Our case also highlights an important clinical aspect regarding the clinical history， progression， and eventual treatment of pa-tients with MPNs. Slow， insidious tumor growth results in pe-riods of asymptomatic clinical status， eventually followed by nonspecific signs and symptoms such as vague abdominal pain. As such， the resulting delay in diagnosis contribute to tumor growth with extensive internal organ involvement， and surgi-cal options may be limited to partial resection and/or debulk-ing in cases where surgery is still a viable treatment option. In our patient， complete resection was limited not only by the in-filtrative nature of the tumor (preventing separation oftumor\n\n【62】from bowel and mesentery)， but also by the amount of bowel that could be resected without compromising digestive func-tion due to a shortened digestive and absorptive surface area.\n\n【63】Several different atypical gastrointestinal presentations of NF1have been previously reported on literature. Our literature re-view included querying the PubMed archive with combinations of the keywords \"Neurofibromatosis Type l，\" “pediatric，”“volVu-lus，\"“mesenteric，\"and “plexiform；\" combining all these terms returned zero 通用删除7(英):<u>(0)</u> results. Nonetheless， refining our search by omitting 1 or more of the above keywords， we found that our case is the second in which a plexiform mesenteric neurofi-broma presented as a small-bowel volvulus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Given that our case report is the second instance in the literature in which mesenteric neurofibromatosis resulted in intestinalvolvuliza-tion， this suggests that although rare， intestinal volvulus from disease burden is a distinct clinical complication of NF1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【64】Furthermore， in contrast to other case reports， the etiolog-ic source of the volvulus identified on imaging， and there-after confirmed on pathologic examination of the specimen， enabled a retrospective diagnosis of NF1. It was only after ra-diologic diagnosis and confirmatory pathology that physical examination findings of classical skin manifestations of NF1were retrospectively recognized， since the clinicians perform-ing the physical examination at time of admission visualized\n\n【65】References：\n\n【66】1\\.

Finally， we propose that in patients presenting with a history of NF1 (or presumptive diagnosis of NF1) and with acute or chronic ab-dominal concerns， the diagnosis of mesenteric neurofibroma-tosis should be considered early， not only for treatment of the patient's symptoms， but also to anticipate potentially morbid and/or fatal sequelae that at the time of this publication re-main incompletely characterized in the literature.\n\n【76】Declaration of Figures' Authenticity\n\n【77】All figures submitted have been created by the authors who confirm that the images are original with no duplication and have not been previously published in whole or in part.\n\n【78】6\\.

It is performed over 30 000 times per year in the United States， specifically for atrial fibrillation. Procedural risks from cardioversion include clot dis-lodgement， sedation effects， site pain， burns， hypotension， dysrhythmias， or heart failure. Generally， back pain is considered to be simple muscle soreness， and cardioversion consents therefore do not include discussion of back injuries.\n\n【26】Case Report： A 46-year-old man with no prior back pain or injury history underwent a planned synchronized cardioversion for atrial fibrillation. He immediately reported new back pain following the procedure. No unusual event such as a fall occurred near the time of the procedure， but upon evaluation， he was found to have a new lumbar compression fracture that caused incapacitating pain for more than 6 weeks.\n\n【27】Conclusions：\n\n【28】Cardioversion has been found to be a safe， effective treatment for atrial fibrillation. Adverse effects are gen-erally minor， and the frequency of adverse effects appear to be low overall. The case reported here represents a rare， but possibly underreported adverse effect， namely， lumbar compression fracture due to cardioversion. Patients should be counseled on the possibility of back injury， even compression fracture， as a result of cardio-version. It would also be prudent to broaden the differential diagnosis possibilities should a patient complain of back pain after cardioversion.\n\n【29】MeSH Keywords： Electric Countershock · Fractures， Compression· Intraoperative Complications\n\n【30】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/927064\n\n【31】Approximately 30 000 cardioversion procedures are performed annually in the United States for atrial fibrillation alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Cardioversion is generally safe， and it is well indicated for several cardiac conditions. Procedural risks from cardiover-sion include clot dislodgement， sedation effects， site pain， burns， hypotension， dysrhythmias， or heart failure. Typically， a transesophageal echocardiogram is done prior to the pro-cedure to ensure that no clots are present within the heart. Postprocedural back pain is often considered to be simple mus-cle soreness. Therefore， cardioversion consents do not include a discussion of potential back injuries. This case highlights a possible major adverse effect that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pain that occurs after cardioversion.\n\n【32】Case Report\n\n【33】A 46-year-old man with frequent atrial fibrillation symptoms that were refractory to medical management underwent syn-chronized cardioversion. He presented with palpitations and a heart rate in the range of 120 to 130 beats per minute. His vital signs were otherwise normal. His weight was weighed137 kg， his height was 1.9 m， and his body mass index was38.9 kg/m². Laboratory test results on the morning of the pro-cedure revealed normal values for calcium， magnesium， creat-inine， hematocrit， troponin， and international normalized ratio. Following an unremarkable transesophageal echocardiogram， he was cardioverted with pads placed on the anterior chest and midback to a normal sinus rhythm with 1 shock at 200J. The procedure and recovery were uneventful， but immediate-ly upon coming out of procedural sedation， he reported new severe low back pain. The procedure had not been complicat-ed by any mishap， fall， or traumatic injury.\n\n【34】The patient's past medical history included atrial fibrillation and nephrolithiasis. He had no history of back pain， and his electronic medical record did not show any medical encoun-ters for back issues in the previous 12 years. His only surgery was cholecystectomy. The medication list included diltiazem240 mg (extended release) daily and apixaban 5 mg twice a day. He used smokeless tobacco (one-quarter tin daily)， and his alcohol use was normal based on his AUDIT-C score.\n\n【35】Differential diagnoses included lumbar back strain， myofascial pain， preexisting condition， herniated disc， pathological frac-ture， and injury-related lumbar fracture.\n\n【36】The initial assessment suggested probable back spasms while the patient was recovering from sedation， and he was treat-ed with acetaminophen， transdermal lidocaine， and cycloben-zaprine. He later tried diclofenac gel and injectable ketorolac\n\n【37】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1. Magnetic resonance imaging scan illustrating the patient's lumbar compression fracture.</u>\n\n【38】without any relief. Auricular acupuncture and cupping pro-vided relief so that he could stand and walk relatively pain free. Diazepam helped slightly for sleeping， but his sleep was poor due to pain associated with any sitting or lying position.\n\n【39】He continued to have severe pain regardless of position. Due to the ongoing， poorly relieved symptoms， an X-ray was ob-tained and showed an L1 vertebral anterior wedge compression fracture with 30% compression. No bony tumor was seen.On X-ray， the bones appeared normal， and owing to the patient's history， sex， and body habitus， osteoporosis did not appear to be a factor. Lumbar magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the L1 compression fracture with 50% anterior to mid-verte-bral body loss of height， marrow edema in the upper 50% of L1， endplate edema， and L4-L5 mild disc buge with mild left foraminal stenosis . No osteoporotic change，patho-logic lesion， or posterior compromise was noted. Testing for testosterone， 25-hydroxy vitamin D， thyroid functions， hemo-globin A.c， and glucose repeat yielded normal results.\n\n【40】The patient needed diazepam or hydrocodone and acetamino-phen in order to get any sleep for over 6 weeks after the pro-cedure. Even after 6 weeks， he was unable to sleep well or to tolerate any pressure against the L1 vertebra due to pain. Furthermore， he had progressive L1-L2 bilateral sensory neu-ropathy that worsened over time and spread to his thighs and testicles. As a consequence， he was referred to neurosurgery and treated with gabapentin. The severe pain started to sub-side after 7 weeks.\n\n【41】Cardioversion is commonly performed for atrial fibrillation to reduce the risk of stroke and is successful in 67% to 91% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， with variability related to the amount of energy de livered and duration of symptoms. The risks commonly asso-ciated with cardioversion include clot dislodgement potentially resulting in a stroke； sedation adverse effects， such as aspi-ration or respiratory depression； shock site pain； burns； tran-sient hypotension； other dysrhythmias； heart failure or injury； or skin damage. A recent assessment of the safety of cardio-version for acute atrial fibrillation indicated that among 419cases， iatrogenic hyponatremia occurred in 1 case， but there were no reports of strokes， major bleeding， serious dysrhyth-mias， or peripheral thromboembolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The study noted 9first-or second-degree burns， which were attributed to a batch of faulty pads. Typical risk factors for vertebral compression fractures are osteoporosis， estrogen deficiency， falls，trauma， low body mass index， tobacco use， frailty， impaired eyesight and impaired physical activity increasing fall risk， malignancy， calcium deficiency， and vitamin D deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Tonic-clonic seizures have also been known to cause lumbar compression fractures. The patient in the current report had none of these risk factors other than light tobacco use.\n\n【42】Lumbar compression fractures are most commonly caused by osteoporosis or trauma， such as from falls or accidents.

We undertook a descriptive cross-sectional study of cutaneous biopsy specimens received in our practice， aiming to document the pattern of practice and the range of underlying causative pathologies in skin biopsies of a black African population. A search of our digital archives was conducted and histopathology reports and requisition forms of all skin biopsy cases accessioned between January 1， 2000， and December 31， 2018， were identified. Data were extracted and analyzed. Skin biopsies constituted 10% (2687/26745) of all surgical specimens. Out of the 2547 biopsies included in the study， 62.5%(1602/2547) came from surgery specialities (general， plastic and paediatric surgery) while 37.1%(945/2547) came from the dermatology department. The techniques of biopsy done were excision (63.4% of all biopsies)； incision (0.6%)； and punch (36%). 126 pathologies were diagnosed. The most frequent pathology was squamous cell carcinoma (7.9% of all biopsies) followed by epidermoid cyst (4.9%) and psoriasis (4.6%). 25 diseases entities accounted for 70.4% of all diagnoses. 176 different disease entities were the underlying cause of all the biopsies and only 25 of these accounted for over 70% of all diagnoses.

Over3000 skin diseases are currently documented in the literature通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Also， the International Classification of Diseases 11th Re-vision (ICD-11) lists over 800 unique diagnosis codes for skin diseases in its Chapter 14 (Diseases of Skin)， even with skin neo-plasms excluded and many distinct entities incorporated into'other specified'subheadings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. It is therefore hardly surprising that skin diseases are among the most common health problems globally and are associated with considerable epidemiological， psychological and economic burdens \\[2A\\].\n\n【10】The bedrock of dermatological diagnosis is a clinical assess-ment with a gross morphological examination. However， a skin biopsy is commonly undertaken to evaluate suspected neoplasm or resolve the differential diagnoses of non-specific lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. A study quantifying the value of skin biopsy in assessing in-flammatory dermatosis reports that histologic diagnosis of skin biopsy provided a working diagnosis for patient treatment in\n\n【11】about 75% of the cases and identified some not previously con-sidered diagnoses in 13% of the cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Skin biopsy is an invaluable tool in dermatology practice.\n\n【12】The skin of colour and Caucasian skin have differences in incidence and presentation of some dermatological conditions. These differences have been attributed partly to disparities in skin biology， structure and function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-9\\]</u>. Analysis of skin biop-sies does yield data on the pattern and prevalence of skin dis-eases. Current knowledge about the epidemiology of skin dis-ease in our setting is mostly from hospital dermatologic clinic studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10-14\\]</u>. Additional and fuller perspectives about the dermatopathology of black skin can be derived by analyzing skin biopsies. Some skin conditions present to other depart-ments， and some skin biopsies originate from specialities other than dermatology. The present study examines the skin biopsies received in our Histopathology laboratory over 19 years in or-der to determine the range of underlying pathologies in black African skins.\n\n【13】Material and Methods\n\n【14】This is a descriptive cross-sectional study of all skin specimens received at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital， Ituku-Ozalla， (UNTH) from January 1， 2000， to December 31， 2018. UNTH is a university teaching hospital and a tertiary referral centre situated in Enugu state， south-eastern Nigeria， which currently has about a 4.4million people by Nigeria’s National Population Commission projections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Enugu State (6.44°N；7.5E) has a humid tropical savanna climate. The record high and low temperatures are 35 and 20C， respectively， the average sunshine ranges from 3.8hours(July) to 7.3 hours (November)， and the yearly average relative humidity is 56.1%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.Enugu state constitutes the major catchment population of UNTH， but people from adjoining states of Anambra， Imo， Abia， Ebonyi and Kogi commonly utilize its facilities. Being a referral centre， it attracts patients from all socioeconomic strata without any bias. The UNTH research ethics committee approved the study.\n\n【15】A search of our digital archives was undertaken， and histopathology reports of all skin biopsies submitted in the pe-riod under review were identified. A skin biopsy was defined as a tissue specimen incorporating the epidermis and dermis with or without the subcutis， removed for diagnostic and/or curative purposes. Biopsies of anal fistula and Bartholin’s cyst， as well as deeper lesions and masses that extended to the skin， were excluded. Also excluded were cases with no demographic information， no clear diagnosis， and cases diagnosed as normal skin. Data were extracted from the histopathology report and the archived requisition forms submitted by the clinician. Data ob-tained included the patient’s gender， age， date of biopsy， type of biopsy， site of biopsy， requesting department and histopatholog-ical diagnosis. Also extracted were clinical information supplied by the clinician， such as duration of sym SyIptoms， distribution of lesions， lesion size， albino status and HV status. Classifi-cation and grouping of diagnoses were done according to the provisions of ICD-11.\n\n【16】Data obtained were analyzed with the Statistical Package for Social Science software， and results were presented in tables of frequencies. Continuous variables were presented as mean with standard deviation—Alpha level of <0.05 was considered significant， and figures were produced with Ggplot2 package of R software.\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1： Number of biopsies by age categories and gender.</u>\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2： Trend of biopsies over a period of 19 years 通用删除7(英):<u>(2000-2018)</u>.</u>\n\n【19】Results\n\n【20】Out of the 26，745 specimens accessioned within the study period，2，687 (10%) were skin biopsies， translating to an average of 141skin biopsies per year. Of these skin biopsies， 140 cases were excluded from further analysis as they did not meet the inclusion criteria leaving 2，547 specimens as the definitive sample size of this studvV.\n\n【21】The demographic characteristics of patients undergoing skin biopsies are shown in Table 1. More females than males un-derwent skin biopsies， and there was a significant difference between the proportions of the two genders. Fig 1 shows several biopsies by age categories and gender. Fig 2 shows the trend of skin biopsies over the years. The highest number of biopsies per annum 通用删除7(英):<u>(228)</u> was received in 2011， while the lowest numbers were seen between 2001 and 2005. The staffing problems expe-rienced in our Pathology department at this time may explain the plunging numbers seen in those particular years. Table 2shows the attending or requesting department， type of biopsy done， and region of the body biopsied. The majority (62%) of the biopsies came from surgery specialities， including general， plastic and paediatric surgical specialities， while the Dermatol-ogy department was responsible for 37.1% (945/2547) biopsies.\n\n【22】Table 3 demonstrates the relationship between groups of skin disease， the department(s) to which they presented and the preferred biopsy technique in their investigation.

Table 4 shows the 25most frequent pathologies seen in biopsies of black African skin. These 25 disease entities constituted 1790 (70.4%) of all diag-noses. The remaining 149 diseases accounted for 757 (28.5%) of the diagnoses.\n\n【28】Table 5 compares the most frequent pathologies diagnosed in skin biopsies submitted to the histopathology laboratory with the most frequent diagnoses in a dermatologic clinic as reported in another study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Discussion\n\n【30】This study analyzed all the skin biopsies， irrespective of source， received at the Pathology department of the University of Nige-ria Teaching Hospital (UNTH)， Enugu， over 19 years and at-tempted to describe their unique attributes histopathological profile. The Pathology department receives and processes all tissue biopsies done in the hospital， including skin biopsies from the dermatology department and cutaneous excision biopsies from other surgical departments. Our study produced some illu-minating insights about skin conditions in a developing tropical black African country. On the theme of demography， the age of patients who had skin biopsies ranged from 1.2 months to91 years， reiterating the profusely reported fact of skin disease being a problem for all age groups. In our study， 3.1the mean age(SD) of those who had skin biopsy was 38.5(19.1) years. This was much higher than the mean ages ranging from 23.5 to 29.5years reported in studies that examined the pattern of skin dis-\n\n【31】ease in the dermatologic clinic setting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，13，17-19\\]</u>. This much higher mean age for skin biopsies may suggest either clinicians are reluctant to subject younger people to an invasive proce-dure such as biopsy or that prevalent skin diseases of younger people do not often require biopsy in their management. The later scenario finds some support in Landis et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>， which analyzed the prevalence of skin conditions stratified by age and observed variation of skin disease among age groups. In their study， actinic keratosis and neoplasms were the topmost diag-noses in age groups 45 years and above， while atopic dermatitis， acne and viral warts topped other diagnoses in younger people. The preponderance of females over males in skin biopsies also reflects a common finding in the epidemiology of skin disease as documented in several studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，14，17，18\\]</u>. Some other studies， however， report more males presenting with skin conditions than females 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，11\\]</u>.\n\n【32】In our study， there was a strong association between the type of skin disease， the departments they presented to and the type of biopsy employed in their evaluation， as shown in Table 3. Benign proliferation， cysts and malignant neoplasms were pre-sented mainly to surgery departments， and the preferred mode of biopsy was excision. Similarly， inflammatory dermatoses presented commonly at the dermatology department and were punch biopsies. Only 37% of the skin biopsies originated from a dermatology practice. The majority of the biopsies (62.5%) were from various surgery specialities， mostly excision biop-sies. This is quite instructive as it represents a departure from the pattern seen in some advanced health systems such as the United States of America， where the majority of the skin can-cers diagnosed annually are excised in dermatologists'offices通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21-23\\]</u>. Our findings suggest that dermatologists in our hospital do less surgery than their counterparts in North America.

As a result， Cryosurgery， electrodesiccation， curettage and excision surgeries are among the repertoire of office-based procedures frequently done by dermatologists in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. As admitted by a practising dermatologist， dermatology residency training in Nigeria emphasize the medical aspect of the speciality with less exposure in dermatologic surgery， and this may explain the preponderance of skin biopsies from surgery specialities in our sample.\n\n【40】Furthermore， In Nigeria， people with diseases present late to the hospital. A study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u> puts the proportion of late presenting cancers in Nigeria at over 70%. Thus most skin cancers at very advanced stages are most likely handled in better-equipped surgical theatres.\n\n【41】Epidemiologic data about skin diseases in Nigeria have mostly come from descriptive studies done in dermatologic clin-ics with few small community-based surveys 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10-14，26\\]</u>. Our study discloses that considerable numbers of skin conditions emanate from other departments apart from the dermatologic clinic. This suggests that data derived from the dermatologic clinic alone would underestimate the hospital prevalence and incidence of skin diseases. An all-inclusive hospital-based epi-demiologic study of skin diseases should involve Pathology pae-diatrics， paediatric surgery， plastic surgery， orthopaedic surgery and general surgery specialities in addition to dermatology.\n\n【42】In our study， only 25 disease entities contributed 70.4% of all diagnoses， while 149 diseases accounted for the remaining 28.5%of diagnoses. As expected， the pattern of skin conditions， as seen in the Pathology laboratory， varied significantly with a presenta-tion in the dermatologic clinic. The topmost diagnosis in pathol-ogy laboratory included squamous cell carcinoma， epidermoid cyst， psoriasis， verruca， neurofibroma， lipoma， lichen planus， haemangioma， metastatic carcinoma and cutaneous lupus ery-thematosus， the picture being dominated entirely by tumorous masses， which require surgical excision for treatment， and der-matosis， which needs biopsy for evaluation. In contrast， the most frequent skin conditions in Nigerian dermatologic clinics， as documented in several studies， include tinea， acne， urticaria， atopic dermatitis， pityriasis versicolor， contact dermatitis， seb-orrheic dermatitis， vitiligo， lichen planus， and pityriasis rosea10-13，26，27\\].\n\n【43】Skin diseases are among the most common health problems globally and are associated with considerable epidemiological， psychological and economic burdens. The 2013 global burden of disease report indicates that 15 dermatological conditions alone contributed 41.6 million DALYs (disability-adjusted life years) or 1.79% of the overall global burden of disease. Compared to157 diseases and injuries， skin and subcutaneous diseases were the 18th leading cause of global morbidity and mortality and4th leading cause of non-fatal burden of disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Also， it was shown that in 2013， 85 million or 27% of Americans consulted a physician for at least 1 skin condition， that the direct health care cost of these consultations stood at $75 billion. That skin disease directly caused 22，953 deaths which translate to 0.9% of all deaths 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【44】Conclusion\n\n【45】Our study documented 176 different histologic entities in black skin biopsies， and only 25 of these constituted over 70% of all diagnoses.

What makes this case of particular inter-est is not the complexity of the surgical procedure carried out， but the singular clinical history of the pathology， from which invaluable lessons can be learned.\n\n【27】Case Report\n\n【28】A 20-year-old man was wounded in a bomb explosion in Africa. Seven days after the traumatic event， when his condition was considered stable， he was transferred by airplane from Africa to Italy and was immediately admitted to a major hospital in Rome. There， the patient， who was also riddled with shrapnel in various areas of the body， was diagnosed and treated for the following traumatic lesions： right side pneumothorax， frac-tures to the sternum， to the left scapula， to the left wrist， and to the left side of the jaw bone. The patient underwent a CT scan of the cranium and cervical spine， which showed only a linear fracture of the left occipital condyle， without distortion or dis placement of the bone . The cervical vertebrae appeared normal  and untouched by the trauma. The only noteworthy aspect of the spine was the loss of the nor-mal lordosis. In truth， the CT scan already showed some signs of instability： the interspinous space between C5 and C6 ap-peared increased compared to the other interspinous spaces. Moreover， in the parasagittal and axial images， the distance between the articular facets C5-C6 was excessive， but these signs were not detected by the medical team at the hospital. The neurological examination did not show any abnormalities. It was deemed no longer necessary for the patient to wear the neck brace that had been put on him from the very begin ning. A week after hospital admission in Italy，the patient be-gan complaining more and more persistently of pronounced\n\n【29】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1. CT scan of the cranium shows a linear fracture of the left occipital condyle without distortion or displacement of the bone.</u>\n\n【30】cervical pain， but considering the normal CT scan findings， the absence of any neurological impairments， and the fact that the patient walked well， the problem was ascribed to muscu-lar tension due to cervical “whiplash” and posttraumatic stress disorder. In truth，when a chest x-ray was carried out 10 days after the patient was admitted to hospital， a preliminary scan of the whole body was also performed， which showed grade 1C5-C6 spondylolisthesis ， but no one noticed.\n\n【31】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2. CT scan of the cervical spine shows the loss of the normal cervical curvature； otherwise， the vertebrae appear to be in perfect alignment and untouched. There are， however， occult signs of instability： increased interspinous space between C5 and C6and increased space between the C5-C6 facets.</u>\n\n【32】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3. Preliminary scan for the chest x-ray shows a grade 1C5-C6 spondylolisthesis.</u>\n\n【33】Two weeks after his arrival in Italy， the patient was transferred from the civilian hospital to the military hospital of Rome. Here， he immediately underwent a CT scan of the cranium and the cervical spine to check the condition of the left occipital condyle fracture and also to ascertain the cause of the strong cervical pain. The scan showed  a grade 3 C5-C6 spondylolis-theses with pronounced slippage and medullar compression；\n\n【34】the inferior C5 articular facets on both sides had suffered for-ward dislocation from the C6 superior articular facets. The neu-rological examination of the patient upon admission showed a clear hyperreflexia of the lower limbs and no plantar reflex re-sponses on both sides， but there was no loss of strength，mo bility， or sensitivity： the patient walked and moved normally. The patient was operated on； during surgery， his neurological condition was constantly assessed through intraoperative neu-rophysiological monitoring (IONM). The patient was put under general anesthesia and， using Crutchfield tongs， progressive cervical traction was applied to his spine until the vertebrae were re-aligned； however， it was not possible to bring the artic-ular facets back to the right position despite several attempts. Keeping the traction， the patient was operated on from the front： a C5-C6 discectomy was carried out， a cage was insert-ed in the intervertebral space， and a titanium plate applied to hold the vertebrae in place. During this phase of the oper-ation， it was possible to ascertain that the anterior and pos-terior longitudinal ligaments were completely damaged. The patient was then turned around and arthrodesis was carried out posteriorly with screws in the lateral masses. The supra-spinal and intraspinal ligaments of C5-C6 were also damaged.\n\n【35】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4.

Post-operative CT scan confirmed the perfect vertebral re-alignment and the success of the circumferential arthrodesis.</u>\n\n【37】When the patient woke up， he showed no neurological impair-ments. A post-operative CT scan  confirmed the per-fect vertebral re-alignment and the success of the circumfer-ential arthrodesis. The post-operative course was normal and， since all the other lesions had healed， 20 days after the cervi-cal surgery， the patient was released.\n\n【38】Discussion\n\n【39】What makes this case singular and noteworthy is that the pro-gressive process of cervical spondylolisthesis， with the complete dislocation of the articular facets (until they were complete-ly stuck)， took place in hospital and， despite its seriousness， the spondylolisthesis did not cause any loss of strength， mo-bility， or sensitivity. It is obvious that mistakes were made in managing this case， which were all understandable yet avoid-able， and some valuable lessons can be learned from them.\n\n【40】The first cervical CT scan showed no vertebral fractures or mis-alignments， but the scan had been performed when the patient was still wearing the neck brace. Furthermore， the fracture of the occipital condyle was a clue pointing to the severity of the trauma that had been suffered by that area of the body and， if the medical staff had been more attentive， all the other signs of instability would have been noticed too. When looking at CT sagittal scans， young surgeons with inadequate experience or 'precipitous' surgeons regard only the central cuts， bypass-ing or skimming through the parasagittal cuts， which， as in our case， show signs of an unstable condition. Ignoring these signs can lead to serious consequences. It is in fact very im-portant to carefully study parasagittal cuts， paying attention to the articular facets， especially their shape， interfacial space， and orientation.

The first-line treatment is topical corticosteroids. However， additional therapy can be given accord-ing to the underlying factors. This report assessed the efficacy of oral acyclovir as adjuvant therapy in the man-agement of OLP.\n\n【19】Case Report：\n\n【20】A 73-year-old man came to our unit reporting he had recurring sores on the tongue for the past 10 years. The tongue was painful and there was taste impairment. Intraoral examination showed erosion and erythematous areas surrounded by white net-like plaques on the tongue and buccal mucosa， as well as depapillation on 2/3dorsal anterior of the tongue. The diagnosis of reticular and erosive OLP was determined based on clinical fea-tures. The patient was prescribed topical corticosteroids， multivitamins， and mouthwash containing chlorine dioxide. Supporting examinations were performed to rule out systemic predisposing factors. The patient was referred for anti-HSV-1 IgG testing， and it was reactive (34.8U/mL). Thus， oral acyclovir was prescribed. After 2weeks of antiviral treatment， the tongue pain and altered taste were resolved， and the clinical features showed significant improvement.\n\n【21】Conclusions： Management of OLP requires a comprehensive approach. OLP symptoms can be relieved if treatment is not only limited to reducing the inflammation but also seeks to remedy other comorbidities， in this case， adminis-tration of an antiviral agent to resolve the HSV-1 involvement.\n\n【22】Keywords： Acyclovir ·Adjuvants， Pharmaceutic · Lichen Planus， Oral· Herpes Simplex· Dentistry·Pathology， Oral\n\n【23】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/934554\n\n【24】日2\n\n【25】2216\n\n【26】盟2 山可甘3 26\n\n【27】Lichen planus (LP) came from the Greek word leichen， which means moss， and planus means flat 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It was first report-ed by Erasmus Wilson in 1869， and in 1895 Thieberg was the first to identify the oral lesion from an LP patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. LP is a chronic mucocutaneous inflammatory disease that in-volves the skin， oral and genital mucosa， hair follicles of the scalp， and fingernails 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a lichen planus involving the oral mucosa and is associated with the T-cell activity that mediates an autoimmune condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>. OLP can co-occur with LP or can precede LP. Around 1-2%of the world population has OLP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. It mostly occurs in fe-males (approximately 77%) aged 30-80 years old， with no race differences 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，6\\]</u>.\n\n【28】People who suffer from OLP may feel pain， burning， but can also be asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，7\\]</u>. The predisposing factors are var-ied， such as stress， flavoring agents， systemic medications(beta-blockers， methyldopa， penicillamine， quinidine， and qui-nine)， dental restorative materials (amalgam， composite res-in， cobalt， and gold)， genetics， food allergy， trauma， system-ic conditions (autoimmune， immunodeficiency， inflammatory bowel disease， diabetes mellitus， hypertension， malignant neoplasm)， unhealthy lifestyle (smoking， alcohol)， and viral in-volvement with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1)， Epstein-Barr virus， cytomegalovirus， human herpesvirus 6 and 7， human papillomavirus (HPV)， hepatitis C virus (HCV)， and Helicobacter pylori 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，4，6，8\\]</u>.\n\n【29】OLP has 6 different clinical manifestations： reticular， plaque， erythematous/atrophic， ulcerative/erosive， bullous， and pap-ular lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，9，10\\]</u>. The diagnosis of OLP can be determined by its characteristic clinical feature， commonly known as Whickham's striae， which is a net-like white lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The lesion appears bilaterally， mostly located in the buccal muco sa， tongue， lips， gingivae， palate， and floor of the mouth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Another way to diagnose OLP is from a biopsy with immuno-fluorescence that shows a band-like appearance of the epithe-lial cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Nevertheless， wherever Whickham's striae are vis-ible bilaterally， this alone is sufficient to diagnose OLP通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，11\\]</u>.\n\n【30】The principle of OLP management is to suppress the activity of T cells with topical corticosteroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. However， due to its various predisposing factors， additional therapy can be giv-en according to the underlying condition. Some studies sug-gested that HSV-1 infection can predispose to development of OLP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，13，14\\]</u>. Therefore， acyclovir administration is a ratio-nal consideration. This report assessed the efficacy of an an-tiviral agent as adjuvant therapy in the management of OLP.\n\n【31】A 73-year-old retired man came to the Oral Medicine Unit in Dr Hasan Sadikin General Hospital reporting painful recurring canker sores on his tongue followed by impaired taste in the last 10 years， which became worse in the past year. He has been smoking since a teenager， consumed herbal drinks， ate spicy food， and sometimes stayed up late. However， he denied having a history of diabetes mellitus， had hypertension and took captopril (without prescription) almost daily.\n\n【32】We performed 3 tests： serological examination， the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) questionnaire， and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-42) questionnaire. The complete blood count showed low levels of hemoglobin， erythrocytes， he-matocrit， and thrombocytes . The liver function (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase \\[SGOT\\] and serum glutam-ic pyruvic transaminase \\[SGPT\\]) were high. Moreover， the per-centage of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was slightly high (6.3%)， indicating an increase in glucose level. The OHIP-14 question-naire was used to assess how far the oral condition affected his well-being. This questionnaire is a reliable and valid tool to assess the oral health-related quality of life in various oral diseases， including OLP patients， although it was not devel-oped especially for OLP conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. It consists of 14 ques-tions (previously 49 questions， created by Slade and Spencer in 1994， and simplified by Slade in 1997) grouped into 7 di-mensions， which assess the functional， social，and psycholog ical effects of oral conditions in a patient's life， as well as the dental treatment needs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> social status， household manage-ment， daily habits， and local factors. The differences in the oral health status possibly occur in between countries， different re-gions， and topographical areas frequently and indirectly con-tributing to oral health status. The objective is to evaluate the difference of Oral Health-Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL). The test showed an improvement in patient condition before and after scaling， from moderate to good . Lastly， to ob-serve whether there is psychological involvement in the pres-ence of OLP， the DASS-42 questionnaire was administered. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale was first developed by Lovibond in 1995， consisting of 42 items (the 21-item version\n\n【33】O Am J Case Rep 2021： 22：e934554\n\n【34】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

The patient admitted that he sometimes felt un-well， dizzy， and fatigued. Aside from the persisted intraoral conditions， we found a crusted ulcer on his left upper lips around the area of teeth 23-24 . Afterwards， sero-logical examinations were redone to check previous system-ic predisposing factors (diabetes mellitus and anemia)， prep-aration for biopsy， and the possibility of HSV-1 infection. The anti-HSV-1 IgG was more than 3 times above normal， reach-ing>34.8 U/mL . He was prescribed 200 mg acyclo-vir 5 times a day， and after 2 weeks of administration， the pa-tient admitted that he felt almost no pain on his tongue and cheeks， and after years， he can taste food and drinks better.\n\n【48】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2.

The tongue was mild on palpation. After the last control， the COVID-19 pandemic started in Indonesia， which prevented follow-up and postponed the plan for biopsy. However， we continued communication online， and 1 week after the last visit， the patient told us that his condition was getting better each day. He maintains oral hygiene and controls diet(low sugar and carbs， also high iron) as per the instructions.\n\n【53】Treating OLP patients is rather challenging due to the unclear etiopathogenesis and multifactorial agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，18\\]</u>. Different peo-ple will have their own causative factors. Therefore， a dentist is required to make a holistic investigation to find the agents causing OLP in each patient. Our patient presented some fac-tors that we suspected contributed to the presence of his con-dition， such as stress， high blood sugar and hypertension， smok-ing， and also HSV-1 infection. Some studies have mentioned stress as one of the precipitating factors， but the mechanism is unclear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，8\\]</u>. We consider stress might also exacerbate the patient's condition when he said that the symptoms had start-ed 10 years ago， quite close to the time of his retirement as a government employee when he was 60 years old. The pain was also worsened in the past year since his wife passed away. The results of the DASS questionnaire also suggested the role of stress. The result showed that he did not have depression or anxiety， but did experience mild stress. Therefore， we only\n\n【54】suggested getting enough rest and do some activities to oc-cupy himself and ease the grief.\n\n【55】The patient had a history of high blood pressure， and although he did not realize it， the laboratory findings showed an elevat-ed HbAlc， SGOT，and SGPT concentration (presumably caused by the routine captopril intake， and long-term herbal drinks consumption). A diabetic patient with a history of hyperten-sion can develop OLP， also called Grinspan's syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，11\\]</u>. Nevertheless，the association between the 3 entities is unclear. A meta-analysis study by Garlapati， Naik， and Sharma in 2017found there was no association between OLP， diabetes melli-tus， and vascular hypertension通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【56】Topical corticosteroid is the drug of choice for OLP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，19\\]</u>. It can also be given systemically when the lesion is widespread 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The lesion in our patient was painful， erosive， and localized on the tongue and buccal mucosa. The Guidelines for the Management of Oral Lichen Planus by the British Society for Oral Medicine， as well as a report from the World Workshop on Oral Medicine 2007， still consider corticosteroid as the first-line therapy， especially for symptomatic atrophic/ulcer-ative/erosive types 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，20\\]</u>. Indeed， medium- to high-potency corticosteroid (Orabase or mouthwash) can be administered with some considerations， such as the severity and location of the lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，19\\]</u>， older age， and comorbid conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Long-term corticosteroid consumptions will promote hyper-glycemia， leads to increased difficulty with glycemic control， and can cause fatty liver； thus， it must be carefully adminis-tered in diabetic patients and people with liver enzyme disor-ders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21，22\\]</u>. Based on this rationale， dexamethasone mouth-wash in combination with topical triamcinolone was prescribed due to the presence of his systemic conditions.\n\n【57】We prescribed oral acyclovir as an adjuvant therapy to our pa-tient based on the clinical outcome， level of HSV-1 IgG， and considering evidence from previous reports. Research has in-vestigated the contribution of viral agents， including HSV-1 in the pathogenesis of LP and OLP. A case-control study of 60 cu-taneous classic LP subjects confirmed the role of HHV-7 in the pathogenesis of LP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. On the contrary， research done by Ali in 2014 did not show a significant correlation between HSV-1and OLP by immunofluorescent examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. A similar study done in the same year by Park and Choi also failed to detect HSV-1 and -2 in OLP specimens by PCR test 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Interestingly， the level of HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG titer increased in all 30 sub-jects (3-10 times above the normal titer)， and 61.5% of subjects\n\n【58】who were treated using oral acyclovir showed clinical improve-ment. A case report in 2016 supports that oral acyclovir admin-istration is effective for lichen planus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. A recent study in Pakistan found 76.7% of eruptive LP patients had a satisfacto-ry response to acyclovir 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Although the connection between OLP and HSV-1 remains unclear， the use of oral acyclovir in OLP patients has been shown to be beneficial. Aside from antiviral agents， some unexplored variables， such as probiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u> and photobiomodulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>， should be considered in future clinical trials for OLP patients. This approach demonstrated promising results by modifying clinical and microbiological parameters in the oral environment that may also affect the response to OLP.\n\n【59】The World Health Organization (WHO) has designated OLP as an oral premalignant condition since 2005 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Factors that may increase the risk of its malignant transformation are poor nu-trition， tobacco and alcohol use， as well as HCV infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Our patient had been smoking since he was young. After be-ing given information regarding the harmful effect of tobacco use on his oral health， the patient was willing to reduce his smoking and finally decided to quit completely. We planned a biopsy to further assess any unfavorable conditions， but the agenda was re-evaluated after reviewing the improvement in the signs and symptoms and considering the patient's age and systemic diseases that make him vulnerable to COVID-19.\n\n【60】Conclusions\n\n【61】OLP is a complex disease because it has multifactorial predis-posing factors. The management of OLP requires careful at-tention and a comprehensive approach. Although it may take time to resolve completely， OLP symptoms can be relieved by reducing inflammation and managing possible underlying fac-tors. In this case， where the HSV-1 IgG was reactive， the ad-ministration of oral acyclovir was effective as adjuvant therapy.\n\n【62】Department and Institution Where Work Was Done\n\n【63】This work was done in the Oral Medicine Unit， Dr Hasan Sadikin General Hospital， Bandung， Indonesia\n\n【64】Declaration of Figures' Authenticity\n\n【65】All figures submitted have been created by the authors who confirm that the images are original with no duplication and have not been previously published in whole or in part.\n\n【66】1\\.

It is an autosomal recessive developmental disorder. The char-acteristic features are amputation of the upper and lower extremities accompanied by aplasia of the hands and feet. The disorder affects only the extremities， without other sys-temic manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Acheiropodia has previously been reported only in Brazilians of Portuguese ancestry. A locus for acheiropodia was mapped on chromosome 7q36 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. We report a case of Horn Kolb Syndrome diagnosed prenatally. To our knowledge， this is the first case published from Turkey and the Old World.\n\n【27】CASE REPORT\n\n【28】A 36-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with abnor-mal findings detected at the 23n week of her fifth gestation. She had been married to her first cousin for 8 years. After the abortion of her first pregnancy at 2 months gestation， she had subsequently given birth at the 20\" week of gesta-tion on 2 separate occasions， both resulting in the death of the baby. Two years prior to the currently described case， she had delivered vaginally at term. The child had had no somatic or developmental abnormalities， but unfortunate-ly， died of pneumonia at age 8 months. Parental karyotype an alysis was normal.\n\n【29】The pregnancy had been confirmed at 10 weeks. She had had antenatal visits and ultrasound exams at the 10h and16 week， both with no remarkable findings. Triple screen-ing and hematological and biochemical test results were also unremarkable.\n\n【30】The woman had used a spironolactone 50 mg and hydrochlo-rothiazide 50 mg combination daily from 16 of December to 15 of January for mild hirsutism and hypertension， or-nidazole 500 mg twice a day orally， and metronidazole 500mg once a day vaginally from 16 December to 23 December for a genital infection.\n\n【31】Although she was married to her cousin， the family back-ground was unremarkable for congenital anomalies. Despite the couple being blood relatives and there having been sev-eral consanguineous marriages discovered during geneo-logical analysis， no family members were found to have had any congenital anomalies.\n\n【32】She was referred to our tertiary centre based on severe ol-igohydramnios， inability to visualize the fetal kidneys， uri-nary bladder and stomach， and minimal right lateral pleu-ral effusion observed during ultrasound.\n\n【33】During the ultrasound examination of the pregnancy， fetal biometry confirmed the 23-week pregnancy using bi-pari-etal diameter， and abdominal circumference measurements. The amniotic fluid index was measured as 0 cm.\n\n【34】Although the cerebral hemispheres and the cerebellum were evaluated as normal， the cisterna magna was slightly enlarged， with the largest diameter being 15.45 mm. Despite poor visibility， the spinal cord and the vertebral column were\n\n【35】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.The new born with Hom Kolb syndrome， just after birth.</u>\n\n【36】evaluated as normal in appearance. The fetal heart could be visualized with 4 chambers， but there were periods of ar-rhythmias dominated with severe bradycardia. We were able to distinguish the fetal kidneys but not the urinary bladder nor the stomach. The fetal sex was female.\n\n【37】During the evaluation of fetal extremities， the fetal fe-mur and humerus were identified and measured， with the measurements showing normal reference levels ap-propriate for the gestational week. However， we were un-able to demonstrate the fetal tibia， fibula， radius， ulna， feet， or hands.\n\n【38】The woman was hospitalized for fetal follow-up and further investigation. However， since fetal death occurred during the first hour of hospitalization， we have obtained consent from the family to terminate the pregnancy and to exam-ine the fetus after birth. Following the administration of misoprostol 200 mcg， vaginally， the fetus， placenta and the associated membranes were delivered 9.5 hours later， and thus， the pregnancy was terminated.\n\n【39】In macroscopic evaluation， the height and weight of the baby were measured as 27 cm and 440 grams， respectively. The face and the skull were normal，but the fetus had bilateral low-set ears. The bilateral forearm and the hand formation were ru-dimentary. There were no separate identifiable digits in either hand. The bilateral legs and feet were rudimentary. There were no separate identifiable digits in either foot .\n\n【40】The autopsy report showed that there was no develop-ment of the distal portions of the lower and upper ex-tremities of the fetus. Although the fetus had normal-ly developed structures of the fetus up to the elbow and the knee joint appropriate for the gestational week， the distal extremities were wing-like， stumpy formations， and had no legs， forearms， wrists or fingers. Other body struc-tures， including the backbone， head，eye， face， heart， in-tra-abdominal viscera， anus， labium majus and genital area， were normal.\n\n【41】X-ray examination confirmed the clinical diagnosis. There was a single hypoplastic ossification centre in both the forearms and the hands. Moreover， there was a sin-gle hypoplastic ossification centre in both legs and feet.\n\n【42】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2. X-ray views the new born.</u>\n\n【43】DISCUSSION\n\n【44】Acheiropodia is classified as acheiria under the heading of “dysostoses with predominant involvement of extremi-ties\" 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. However， the nomenclature for skeletal dysplasia is complicated. Classification based on the underlying mo-lecular genetic cause is clinically useful since faulty genes， whose protein products have similar functions， also result in disorders with similar clinical characteristics. Of near-ly 300 disorders， the genes responsible for skeletal dyspla-sia have been identified in more than 150 diseases， most of which are monogenic diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>.\n\n【45】Acheiropodia is an autosomal recessive inherited trait. The heterozygotes are phenotypically normal. Most affected indi-viduals are the offspring of consanguineous matings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2，6\\]</u>. In our case， the parents were cousins and despite this being the 5th gestation for the couple， they had still not managed to have a healthy， living child following 2 previous second-trimester and 1 first-trimester pregnancy losses.\n\n【46】The estimated incidence of acheiropodia in Brazil is ap-proximately 1/250，000 births 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Moreover， with the ex-ception of 2 cases from Puerto Rico， all known cases are of Brazilian origin. A hospital-based study in Boston， USA by McGuirk et al. found the prevalence rate of all types oflimb deficiencies to be 0.69/1000通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【47】Although clinical and experimental studies have not re-vealed the link between teratogens and acheiropodia， it is the authors' opinion that more trials are needed in order to reach an accurate conclusion concerning their possible role in acheiropodia. In one study， smoking was found to be associated with an increase in congenital limb defects通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. However， although spironolactone and hydrochloro-thiazide， which the mother used during the present case，\n\n【48】are classified as risk factor D drugs in pregnancy no major limb malformations have been reported for these agents. Metronidazole and ornidazole， on the other hand， are clas-sified as risk factor B drugs in pregnancy and， although no significant rise in the number of major limb malformations has been reported for these agents， they have been found to be mutagenic and carcinogenic in animal studies \\[91. The possible involvement of teratogenic effects in the spe-cifics of our case (cellular phone base station， spironolac-tone， hydrochlorothiazide，ornidazole and metronidazole) needs further investigation.\n\n【49】Prenatal diagnosis of acheiropodia is extremely difficult due to the rarity and unfamiliarity of the entity. In the evalua-tion of 226 fetuses and stillbirths with suspected skeletal dys-plasia， Sharony et al. was unable to find any sign of skeletal dysplasia or obvious dysmorphic syndrome in 7% of cases. They concluded that skeletal dysplasia could be diagnosed as early as the 14h week of gestation by ultrasound. In ad-dition， they suggested the use of fetal radiographs to reach an accurate diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In our case， although prenatal diagnosis was inaccurate because of the difficulties created by the severe oligohydramnios， the inability to see the dis-tal parts of the upper and lower extremities was helpful in ascertaining the severity of the condition.\n\n【50】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【51】We recommend that severe dysmorphic skeletal anoma-lies be ruled out in every single pregnancy and the dem-onstration of all 4 limbs become routine in prenatal ultra-sound screening.\n\n【52】REFERENCE：\n\n【53】1\\.

Those with BCL6 translocations have a pre-dilection for rare extranodal sites such as the gastrointestinal tract， nasopharynx， and tonsils. Involvement of the skull and adnexal structures is rare. Here we report a case of a young female with both skull and adnexal involvement.\n\n【24】Case Report： A 20-year-old female who presented with hypercalcemia was found to have adnexal， skull， and jaw masses. Workup revealed a stage lV high grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL) with MYC and BCL6 rearrangements. She was subsequently treated with R-EPOCH and attained complete remission 9 months after her initial presentation. To the best of our knowledge， our patient represents the first reported case of skull and adnexal involvement in HGBL with MYC and BCL6 rearrangement.\n\n【25】Conclusions： Rare extranodal presentations of HGBL with MYC and BCL6 rearrangement should be considered in the differ-ential diagnosis of masses found in unusual sites such as the skull and adnexa. Due to their aggressive nature， early and prompt recognition of these lymphomas is essential for timely administration of appropriate therapy.\n\n【26】MeSH Keywords： Genes， myc·Lymphoma， B-Cell· Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6\n\n【27】Abbreviations： DHL - double-hit lymphoma； HGBL- high grade b-cell lymphoma； H&E - hematoxylin and eosin；\n\n【28】FISH -fluorescent in-situ hybridization； WHO - World Health Organization； LDH - lactate dehydrogenase； CNS - central nervous system； R-CODOX/MVAC-chemotherapy regimen consisting of vincristine， doxo-rubicin， cyclophosphamide， cytarabine， methotrexate， filgrastim； HyperCVAD -chemotherapy regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide， vincristine， doxorubicin， dexamethasone， cytarabine， mesna， and meth-otrexate；R-EPOCH - chemotherapy regimen consisting of rituximab， etoposide phosphate， prednisone， vincristine， cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin； DA-EPOCH-chemotherapy regimen consisting of dose adjusted etoposide phosphate， prednisone， vincristine， cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin\n\n【29】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/909400\n\n【30】品目日1512 1 山6 26\n\n【31】High grade B-cell lymphomas (HGBL) are usually characterized by cytogenetic abnormalities involving MYC with BCL2 and/or BCL6 according to the World Health Organization (WHO)2016 Classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>.

To our knowledge， this is the first case of HGBL with MYC and BCL6 rearrangements involving both the skull and the adnexa.\n\n【32】A 20-year-old female presented to the Emergency Department with the chief complaint of nausea and vomiting， loss of sen-sation on the left side of the face and both sides of tongue， and double vision. These symptoms had started 2 weeks pri-or to the Emergency Department visit and had progressive-ly become worse. Upon initial evaluation， she was found to have a non-tender palpable mass on the left forehead，lateral rectus palsy on the right side， and fullness in the flanks of the abdomen. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head re-vealed 3 skull lesions associated with extension into the epi-dural space and subcutaneous soft tissue . We could not distinguish whether they were metastatic or inflammatory lesions. The CT of the sinuses revealed areas of bone erosion of the posterior aspect of the right maxillary sinus and in the posterior aspect of the right side of the mandible. Initial labo-ratory evaluation was significant for elevated LDH (8410IU/L)， hyperuricemia (12.3 mg/dl)， and positive EBV VCA IgG and negative IgM. The patient was started on intravenous fluids and one dose of rasburicase was administered. A neurosurgi-cal consultation was obtained， and a left craniotomy was per-formed.Approximately 3.5x3.5 cm left subcutaneous mass and8x4 cm fibrous lesion in the left epidural area were resected. Pathology of the specimens revealed high grade CD10 positive B-cell lymphoma . Fluorescent in-situ hybridization(FISH) analysis from the skull mass revealed t(8： 14)(C-MYC) and BCL6(3q27) rearrangement. Subsequently， CT scan of neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis was performed and revealed 9.0×12.0×13.2 cm and 10.7×8.1×5.4 cm soft tissue masses with peripheral follicles in the right and left adnexal areas respectively .

The International Prognostic Index (IPI) score was calculated at 3 (high intermediate).\n\n【44】The patient was then transferred to another institution where she received R-EPOCH (rituximab， etoposide phosphate， pred-nisone， vincristine， cyclophosphamide， and doxorubicin)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> and achieved complete remission 9 months after diagnosis.\n\n【45】During the hospital stay， it was discovered that the patient had an admission in a neighboring hospital around 4 weeks prior to the current presentation. Review of medical records revealed that the patient was referred to the hospital af-ter hypercalcemia was found on routine laboratory testing. The patient was asymptomatic at that time. A CT scan per-formed during that admission revealed a left adnexal mass measuring 5.8x4.2x5.5cm and right adnexal mass measuring6.1×5.5×7.4 cm. The patient was managed with intravenous fluids with subsequent normalization of the calcium levels and was discharged. The patient was then lost to follow-up until the presentation in our institution.\n\n【46】Discussion\n\n【47】In the 2016 WHO classification， “gray zone lymphomas\" have been assigned a new category termed high grade B-cell lym-phoma (HGBL) with MYC and BC L2 and/or BCL6 rearrangement. This category includes lymphomas with a gene expression pro-file (GEP) intermediate between molecular BL and non-molec-ular BL (most of which are DLBCL) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【48】Double-hit lymphomas (DHL) are characterized by MYC trans-location and either a BCL2 or BCL6 translocation. DHL involv-ing MYC and BCL2 translocation occur in around 5% cases\n\n| Diagnosis  | Demographics  | Cytogenetics (by FISH orotherwise specified)  | Location  | Treatment and Outcome  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| DLBCL|11|  | 1 patient -HIV  | BCL2 translocation  | CNS， bone， marrow，  | Died in progression  |\n|  | negative  | BCL6 translocation  | peripheral blood  |  |\n| DLBCL|10  | 3 patients  | MYC (break apart probe) BCL6 rearrangement  | Intestine， stomach  | CHOP， died of disease  |\n| DLBCL|12  | 1 patient  | MYC translocation  | Sacrum， lymph nodes，  | R-CHOP therapy.  |\n|  |  | BCL6 rearrangement  | stomach  |  |\n| DLBCL9|  | 3 patients  | 2 patients - Burkitt  | Ovaries  | 1 patient alive with  |\n|  |  | lymphoma (MYC positive)  |  | disease  |\n|  |  | 1 patient -DLBCL (MYC/  |  | 2 patients died with  |\n|  |  | BCL2 positive)  |  | disease  |\n| Burkitt lymphoma  | 1 patient  | C-MYC by southern blot  | Ovaries  | R-CHOP  |\n| 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>  |  |  |  |  |\n| DHL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>  | 1 patient  | MYC translocation  | Skull， nasopharynx， CNS  | Patient died one month  |\n|  |  | BCL2 translocation  |  | after diagnosis  |\n| DHL/THL通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>  | 27 patients  | MYC  | Ovary 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>， bone 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>，  | More extranodal sites  |\n|  |  | BCL2  | stomach 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>， CNS 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>，  | for DHL/THL (23/27  |\n|  |  | BCL6  | other extranodal sites.  | Patients】  |\n| DHL/THL|14  | 5 patients  | BCL2/IGH rearrangement  | Adrenal mass.  | R-EPOCH  |\n|  |  | MYC rearrangement  | supraclavicular LN，  | Hyper-CVAD  |\n|  |  | BCL6 rearrangement  | subareolar breast  | R-Hyper CVAD  |\n|  |  |  | mass， bone marrow  | DA-EPOCH-R  |\n|  |  |  | and peripheral blood，  |  |\n|  |  |  | peripancreatic LN and  |  |\n|  |  |  | celiac trunk LN  |  |\n| BCL-U with features  | 2 patients  | MYC/BCL2/BCL6  | Patient 1 -tonsil mass，  | Patient 1 - declined  |\n| intermediate  |  | rearrangement (1  | frontal bone of skull.  | treatment and died  |\n| between large  |  | patient)  | Patient 2 - LN， rib  | Patient 2 - partial  |\n| B-cell lymphoma  |  | MYC/BCL2  | lesions  | response with R-ESHAP  |\n| and Burkitt  |  | rearrangement (1  |  |  |\n| Lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>  |  | patient)  |  |  |\n| BCLU (intermediate  | 1 patient  | BCL6/MYC juxtaposition  | Bone marrow  | Good prognosis -  |\n| between BL and  |  |  |  | patient did well after  |\n| DLBCL) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>  |  |  |  | receiving RCHOP and then R-CODOXM-IVAC  |\n| Large B-cell  | 6 patients  | MYC translocation  | Nasopharynx，cervical  | R-CHOP， 3 alive， 1 dead，  |\n| lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>  |  | BCL6 (3q27)  | LN， liver， RPLN  | 2N/A  |\n\n【50】CNS - central nervous system； diffuse large B-cell lymphomas， DLBCL -double- hit lymphoma/triple-hit lymphoma，DHL/THL； FISH -fluorescent in-situ hybridization； LN -lymph node.\n\n【51】of DLBCL and have a median survival of about 8 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Most of these cases present with extranodal involvement， in-cluding involvement of bone marrow， peripheral blood， pleu-ral effusion， stomach， ascites， and bones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. DHL with MYC and BCL6 translocation are also very aggressive tumors and tend to have extranodal involvement， as illustrated in Table 1. Common extranodal sites with MYC/BCL2 or MYC/BCL6 trans-locations include liver， central nervous system， ribs， breast， in-testine， sacrum， and stomach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，8-13\\]</u>.\n\n【52】Literature search was performed to look into \"double-hit/triple-hit\"lymphomas with large B-cell morphology/DLBCL/BCL-U/BL morphology . Historically， lymphomas harboring BCL6translocations tend to present more with extranodal sites when compared to BCL2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. But in the case of DHL harboring BCL6translocation， the correlation is not well defined. For example， in a small series of DHL with MYC/BCL2 translocations， ex-tranodal involvement was reported in 85-95% of cases with bone marrow being the most common site 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15-17\\]</u>. On the\n\n【53】other hand， Pillai et al. demonstrated extranodal involvement in more than 75% of their small series of MYC/BCL6 DHL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Furthermore， Turakhia et al. reported up to 50% involvement of extranodal sites， mainly soft tissue， in their series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Involvement of extranodal sites carries a worse prognosis across the board.\n\n【54】Our search yielded only 2 cases of“double-hit/triple-hit\"lym-phomas involving the skull 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，7\\]</u>. One case was a MYC/BCL2translocation and involved the skull， nasopharynx and cen-tral nervous system， and the patient died 1 month after di-agnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The other case involved the skull and tonsil and had MYC/BCL2/BCL6 rearrangement and the patient declined treatment and died 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Four cases have been reported with involvement of the ovaries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，18\\]</u>. Our case had bilateral ad-nexal lesions but was not biopsied.\n\n【55】MYC has an important role in cell-cycle progression， apoptosis， and cellular transformation via induction of genes involved in cell cycle control (such as cyclin D1) and suppression of growth arresting genes. Translocation to IG loci results in the control of its expression (it is dysregulated by NF-Kb and BCL6)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. BCL2 has potent anti-apoptotic functions that lead to a sur-vival advantage of the involved B cells. The aggressive course and chemotherapy resistance of MYC/BCL2 DHLs are related to a synergism between the 2 mechanisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. BCL6 interacts with p53 tumor suppressor gene in germinal center B cell to prevent their apoptosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Translocation of BCL6 gene leads to its dysregulation which ultimately leads to repression of cell cycle regulators and hence its role in oncogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. This ex-plains double-hit lymphomas (DHL) with MYC and either BCL6or BCL 2 re-arrangement having a more aggressive course than single-hit lymphomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，23\\]</u>.

Rarely does the disease manifest with orolaryngeal symptoms before ocular ones. We present a case of MG that on initial presentation had symptoms of cranial nerves (CN) IXand X weakness， including dysphagia and dysphonia.\n\n【26】Case Report： A 51-year-old woman with panic attacks presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with complaints of her throat closing， swallowing difficulty， and hoarse voice. Multiple ED visits revealed no etiology. However， she developed stridor， which prompted further evaluation. Laryngoscopy and imaging studies revealed no gross abnormalities； therefore， her symptoms of dysphonia and difficulty breathing were attributed to anxiety. Her hospital course was complicated by a cardiac arrest requiring intubation. ECHO， CTA chest， and MRI brain were unremarkable. Her cardiac arrest was hypothesized as being secondary to laryngeal spasm. During her ICU course， she failed extubation multiple times due to acute respiratory failure. An autoimmune etiology was sus-pected， prompting a paraneoplastic screen， which revealed elevated levels of AChR antibodies at 124 mmol/L. MG was diagnosed and treatment with plasmapheresis and steroids was initiated. However， complications of thrombocytopenia， anemia， and ARDS ensued， so MG treatment was discontinued. The patient was eventually transferred to a LTACH. Thereafter， at outpatient followup， her MG was treated with mycophenolate and pred-nisone， which led to significant symptom improvement.\n\n【27】Conclusions：\n\n【28】MG commonly presents in the third decade with clinical features of ptosis， diplopia， and facial weakness. However， initial and isolated symptoms of dysphagia and dysphonia are rare， leading to missed diagnoses. Our case of a middle-aged woman posed a diagnostic challenge because of her uncommon presentation and co-morbidities of panic attacks and obesity. This case highlights the crucial need for a high index of clinical sus-picion for MG in any patient presenting with symptoms of CN IX and X weakness.\n\n【29】MeSH Keywords： Autoimmune Diseases of the Nervous System·Dysphonia· Neuromuscular Junction Diseases·\n\n【30】Receptors， Nicotinic\n\n【31】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/923750\n\n【32】目名11884 出E 山：的目 日1 10\n\n【33】Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease in which the body produces autoantibodies that bind to acetylcholine receptors on skeletal muscle， thus causing muscle weakness and fatiga-bility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

We dis-cuss an unusual presentation of myasthenia gravis present-ing with dysphagia and dysphonia in a middle-aged woman， posing a diagnostic challenge.\n\n【34】Case Report\n\n【35】A 51-year-old woman with a past medical history of severe anxiety and panic attacks presented to the ED multiple times for complaints of feeling her throat closing up， difficulty swal-lowing and speaking， and hoarseness in her voice. On her ini-tial ED visit， she was sent home on azithromycin for a pre-sumed upper-respiratory infection. She came back to the ED 1 week later with worsening symptoms and a new-onset rash. An allergic reaction to azithromycin was suspected and she was treated with epinephrine，diphenhydramine， and ste-roids， then was later discharged. Her dysphagia symptoms re-mained， leading to another ED visit， at which she reported per-sistent symptoms of difficulty breathing， throat closing， and occasional difficulty swallowing and speaking. She addition-ally reported progressive dysphagia to solids for 2-3 months， with intermittent hoarseness and stridor. Vitals were overall stable： afebrile (97.4°F \\[36.3°C\\])， BP 138/90， HR 88， saturating100% on room air. A physical exam showed an obese female in no distress， with adequate airway entry bilaterally and equal chest expansion. Chem-7 and complete blood count panel val-ues were all within normal range： WBC 7.85/nL， hemoglobin14.7 g/dL， platelets 146/nL， sodium 143 mmol/L， potassium3.2 mmol/L chloride 105 mmol/L， carbon dioxide 29 mmol/L， BUN 15 mg/Dl， creatinine 0.62， alkaline phosphatase 59 U/L， ALT 36 U/L， AST 13 U/L， and glucose 106 mg/dL. Results of a CXR were unremarkable.A CT scan of the soft tissue in her neck showed focal mucosal thickening within the sphenoid si-nus， but otherwise no abnormalities. The nasopharynx， oro-pharynx， hypopharynx， glottis， and subglottic trachea were normal. ENT was called to further evaluate the patient. A bed-side flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy examination revealed full-ness at the base of the tongue， with no evidence of asymme-try or obvious mass， posterior laryngeal edema suggestive of reflux disease， and pooling in the piriform sinuses suggesting poor swallowing. Her vocal cords were mobile bilaterally. There was no stridor and her airway appeared widely patent. At this\n\n【36】time， given a previous history of Helicobacter pylori infection， abdominal pain， and progressive dysphagia， a gastrointesti-nal etiology for her symptoms was being considered. She was admitted to the general medical floors for further evaluation.\n\n【37】In the following days， several rapid responses were called. The evening following admission， she experienced chest tight-ness and difficulty breathing. An EKG was done and was not significant for any new changes. Her symptoms were believed at the time to be due to her severe anxiety， and lorazepam was ordered， with subsequent improvement in her symptoms. The same night， rapid response was called again， as she ap-peared lethargic， with an extremely faint voice， whispering“l can't talk”. She received diphenhydramine for possible al-lergic reaction， and was placed on supplemental oxygen， sat-urating 100% on a 2-Lnasal cannula. Psychiatric consultation was requested for further evaluation of acute anxiety. Her family members at bedside revealed a history of anxiety and panic attacks occurring in the past 2-3 years since the death of the patient’s mother. Family members described her at-tacks as sudden inability to speak and episodes of her throat closing up. At this time， the diagnosis of conversion disorder was considered.\n\n【38】On the third day of hospitalization， another rapid response was called. She was observed sitting at the edge of the bed after ambulating from the bathroom， but looked uncomfort-able. She was pale and tachypneic with RR 40 and extreme-ly faint voice. She suddenly lost consciousness without any palpable pulses. CPR was immediately started， she was in-tubated， and ROSC was quickly achieved with compressions only. An EKG after arrest showed ventricular bigeminy， 15 beats of ventricular tachycardia， and then 3 minutes of accelerat-ed idioventricular rhythm. She was transferred to the ICU for further care. A cardiac etiology of her arrest was judged to be less likely. An echocardiogram showed normal LV and RV SyS-tolic function with no significant valvular abnormalities， and a cardiac catheterization done 3 months prior to presentation showed nonobstructive coronary arteries. Due to the sudden onset of shortness of breath， pulmonary embolism was also considered， but a CTA chest was unrevealing. An intracranial process was also considered due to her loss of consciousness. but a CT head was also unremarkable.Given the sequence of events and symptoms she experienced since admission， it was thought that she had laryngeal spasms causing significant hy-poxia， thus resulting in cardiac arrhythmia.\n\n【39】The following morning， she was extubated and within minutes developed acute respiratory failure， requiring immediate rein-tubation. During the intubation， visualization of her vocal cords showed normal anatomy with some arytenoid edema， so a ste-roid taper was initiated starting with intravenous dexameth-asone 4 mg 4 times daily. Gastroenterology was consulted to\n\n【40】evaluate esophageal abnormalities； however， given that she was intubated， an adequate work-up could not be done at the time. Extubation was attempted again； however， she was re-intubated within days due to tachypnea， hypoxia， and hyper-capnia. Arterial blood gas showed pH 7.0， pCO2 116，02 103， bicarbonate 29， and 02% 93% on a non-rebreather mask.\n\n【41】At this time， a paraneoplastic and autoimmune work-up for the etiology of her acute respiratory failure was performed. Surprisingly， acetylcholine receptor binding antibodies were elevated at 124 mmol/L (reference range <0.02 nmol/L)； thus， the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis was considered. Neurolog was consulted and plasma exchange with 3.6 L albumin was55initiated for a total plan of 5 sessions every other day. She was continued on intravenous steroids tapered down to hydrocor-tisone every 6 hours and subsequently to prednisone 60 mg daily. Given that she was sedated and mechanically ventilated， the response to treatment was unable to be appreciated in the acute setting. Her hospital course was further complicat-ed by sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome due to hospital-acquired multilobar pneumonia. Due to her sepsis， steroids were discontinued while she remained on antibiot-ics. She also experienced severe anemia and thrombocytope-nia requiring transfusions， and thus only completed 2 sessions of plasmapheresis before discontinuation. Her prolonged and complicated ICU stay eventually ended with placement of a tracheostomy and PEG tube and transfer to a long-term care facility. After completing her antibiotics， she resumed treat-ment with prednisone， with an up-titration of 10 mg every 5days starting at 10 mg and reaching a maintenance dose of60 mg for 2 months with a subsequent taper. She was soon maintained on treatment with prednisone 20 mg every other day， pyridostigmine 60 mg 3 times daily， and mycophenolate500 mg twice daily， with considerable improvement in her ini-tial bulbar symptoms.\n\n【42】Discussion\n\n【43】Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease in which the body produces autoantibodies against acetylcholine recep-tors on skeletal muscle， impairing transmission at the neu-romuscular junctions either by direct inhibition of acetylcho-line binding to the muscle or accelerating the degradation of acetylcholine receptors， thus decreasing the number of recep-tors. As a consequence， patients experience skeletal muscle weakness and fatigability. Clinical presentation of the disease varies widely among patients. Extraocular muscle weakness， diplopia， and ptosis are present in 90% of patients diagnosed with myasthenia gravis， being the initial complaint in about50% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Surprisingly， our patient and her family members did not report any history of ocular symptoms， thus posing a di-agnostic challenge.\n\n【44】Myasthenia gravis can occur at any age， but typically occurs in a bimodal distribution. The peak incidence is at 30 years in females and 65 years in males 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Furthermore， myasthenia can be divided into late-onset and early-onset. Approximately65-70% of all MG cases are early-onset (<50 years)， where-as up to 30% are late-onset 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Late-onset myasthenia，peak-ing at 70-80 years in both sexes， frequently presents with bulbar symptoms such as dysphagia， dysphonia， and dysar-thria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， and ocular symptoms are less common. Dysphagia occurs in 15-40% of patients in generalized myasthenia， but it is uncommon for it to be the only manifestation of the dis-ease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The diagnosis of myasthenia in a patient with these isolated symptoms should be considered. Unfortunately， our patient's history of severe anxiety and panic attacks， atypical age range， and atypical presentation with only bulbar symp-toms deterred us from considering an autoimmune etiology， thus delaying diagnosis.\n\n【45】About 20-30% of patients diagnosed with myasthenia gravis are affected by myasthenic crisis， and in some cases， this is the initial presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In a study of 51 myasthenic patients， Quereshi et al. described 7 patients (approximately 14%) with no previous diagnosis of MG presenting with acute respiratory failure. Of these 7 patients， most demonstrated predominantly bulbar symptoms along with ocular involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However， only 1 patient was found to have isolated bulbar involvement， similar to our patient， again posing a diagnostic challenge.\n\n【46】Identification of myasthenia gravis includes multiple approaches. Apart from clinical symptoms and physical examination find-ings， diagnostic testing includes presence of autoantibodies， slow repetitive nerve stimulation， and single-fiber electromy-ography. The most specific diagnostic test， and the test used in our case， is elevated acetylcholine receptor antibodies in the serum， which is positive in 85% of patients with generalized myasthenia and in only 50% of patients with only ocular my-asthenia gravis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. However， seronegative disease is not un-common， and the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis should not be overlooked. In fact， Renard et al. presented a case of laryn-geal myasthenia gravis in which the patient showed a lack of antibodies， normal repetitive nerve stimulation， and absence of extra-laryngeal involvement， whose symptoms improved upon initiation of therapy despite a negative myasthenia work-up通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【47】It is rare to see acute respiratory failure as the presenting symp-tom of myasthenia gravis， as witnessed in our patient. It is reasonable to believe that her symptoms of myasthenia may have presented when she was diagnosed with anxiety， as she experienced symptoms of dysphagia and dysarthria during her assumed panic attacks. Unfortunately， it may have been left undiagnosed due to anchoring bias. In patients experiencing such a crisis， timely initiation of plasma exchange and intra-venous immunoglobulins reduces the duration of mechanical\n\n【48】ventilation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Unfortunately， given our patient's complica-tions during her hospital course resulting in long-term tra-cheostomy and ventilation， we were unable to assess her re-sponse to plasma exchange.\n\n【49】Conclusions\n\n【50】Late-onset myasthenia gravis can mimic psychiatric panic dis eases and anaphylactic reactions because of the bulbar presen-tation. Misdiagnosis due to lack of recognition of appropriate symptoms is common. Myasthenia gravis should be ascertained with a low threshold as a differential diagnosis of acute-onset dysphagia，dysphonia， and/or dysarthria in middle-aged to el-derly people. Recognition of these symptoms should prompt early work-up of autoimmune etiology and initiation of ther-apy to prevent severe complications of myasthenic crises and acute respiratory failure.\n\n【51】References：\n\n【52】1\\.

This clinical case suggests that it is necessary to perform at least ultrasonography to rule out life-threatening emergencies， which may be hidden by nephrolithiasis. In particular this report shows up a severe clinical manifestation of a rare hereditary dis-ease in a young man， associated for the first time with renal tubular acidosis and a history of kidney stones.\n\n【25】CASE REPORT\n\n【26】A 42-year-old， Caucasian， man with a past clinical history positive for nephrolithiasis presented to our Emergency Room for acute right flank pain and rare episodes of neck pain. A plain abdominal X-ray was normal， neck X-ray showed vertebral artery calcifications， and laboratory tests indicated a mild， stage II， renal failure (glomerular filtration rate equal to 64 ml per minute， plasma creatinine equal to 115micromoles per liter). He responded to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and， consequently， he was discharged from the Emergency Department with the invitation to present to the Renal Unit for a spe-cialistic evaluation on the next morning.\n\n【27】The following day he presented to our Department. He had no symptoms， but we decided to admit him in our Renal Unit for a few days in view of mild renal failure and no clinical andlaboratory data concerning neph-rolithiasis. After a few hours from his admittance he had acute abdominal pain， not responsive to common anti-inflammatory drugs. He developed hypotension， which was immediately followed by cardiopulmonary arrest. Immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation restored a spontaneous circulation. Subsequent ul-itondcam trasonography and computed tomography revealed intra-abdominal bleeding due to rupture of hepatic artery aneurysm. Surgical ligation of hepatic artery， necessitating cholecystectomy， and intraoperative hemostasis packing was performed for uncontrollable\n\n【28】haemorrhage. Then， he was transferred to intensive care unit. He developed postoperative acute renal fail-ure by hypoperfusion with maintained diuresis. Fluid loading， without extracorporeal treatment， improved renal function. Arterial rupture， previous history of kidney stone formation， plasma and urine data sug-gestive for renal tubular acidosis， thin translucent skin and some facial characteristics brought to my mind Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Table 1 shows patient’s clinical characteristics for the diagnosis of vascular type Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. He also deve-loped severe acute liver failure by hepatic ischemia， which was improved by therapeutic plasmapheresis. Conventional angiography and CTangiography showed abdominal aorta with reduced diarneter， stenosis of the celiac tripod like Dunbar’s syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>， splenic artery obstruction， right renal artery stenosis， left vertebral artery occlusion， and small ectasias of the bilateral an-terior and middle cerebral arteries. Improved clinical conditions permitted transfer to surgical department. He developed arterial hypertension which was well controlled by clonidine. We diagnosed incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> based on high urine pH (always above 5.5； also during furosemide test)， hypokalemia (equal to 3.01， normal range 3.5-5 mEq per liter)， and hypocitraturia (equal to 0.25， normal range 2.1-3.3 micromoles/24hours). We started po-tassium citrate therapy in order both to correct hy-pokalemia and hypocitraturia， and to prevent kidney stone formation. After 71 days of admission he was discharged. As expected the molecular genetic testing identified a mutation in the COL3A1 gene， confirming the clinical diagnosis of vascular type Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Nowadays， after 1-year follow-up time，his clinical conditions are good， renal function is steady， plasina and urinary electrolytes are in the normal range and， above all， he had no episodes of vascular rupture and nephrolitiasis\n\n【29】DISCUSSION\n\n【30】Literature data tell us that there are a few cases of pediatric patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome\n\n【31】Table 1.

Patients with type I renal tubular acidosis are often asympomatic， but sometimes they can have complaints due to hypokalemia， osteoporosis， and stone disease caused by the combination of a high urine pH and low citrate excretion. At the present time， the mechanisms responsible for renal tubular acidosis in collagenopathies are unknown. Until now nephrolithiasis due to type I renal tubular acidosis has not been identified as clinical manifestation of the vascular type Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4， 5\\]</u>. As oc-curred in our case， type TV Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is often unrecognized in childhood， because many affected children have no complications and their families have negative family history. About 70%of adult patients with vascular type Ehlers-Danlos syndrome show vascular rupture or dissection and gastrointestinal perforation or organ rupture. About50% of the arterial ruptures are localized in the thorax and abdomen， the remaining 50% are sited in the head.neck and extremnities. About 25% ofaf-fected patients show rupture of the gastrointestinal tract. The site of most frequent perforations is the sigmoid colon， while the rupture of the stomach and small bowel is rarely described. A lot of com-plications during and following surgery are linked to the weakness of tissues and vessels， which cause recurrent arterial or bowel tears， fistulas and suture dehiscences. Uncommon complications include or-gan ruptures， involving the heart with ventricular\n\n【34】REFERENCES：\n\n【35】1\\. Loukas M， PinYard J， Vaid S， Kinsella C， Tariq A， Tubbs RS.

In this prospective trial， patients with LAHNC at a local cancer centre in northwest India will be treated with two short-course hypo-fractionated RT regimens. There were 7 females and 33 males in this study. The bulk of our study group consisted of smokers and tobacco chewers， and the majority had this habit for 20-30 years，according to the results. In our study population， there was an overall improvement in quality of life and pain， speech， and overall health. In conclusion， patients’ quality of life significantly improved in both groups， and there was no statistically significant difference. Therefore， the Christie regime may be similarly helpful in treating some patients to obtain a complete response.\n\n【5】KEYWORDS Head Cancer， Neck cancer， hypofractionated palliative radiation therapy\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】According to GLOBOCAN 2018， head and neck cancer is the17th most frequent cancer worldwide， with a mortality rate of less than 3%. Nevertheless， in Southeast Asian nations， it is a major issue. Only the regions of Southeast Asia contribute to more than 50% of head and neck cancer mortality. One-third of all head and neck cancer cases worldwide are caused in India通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1， 2，3\\]</u>. According to GLOBOCAN 2018 data， head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is India's second most prevalent cancer and the most common cancer among Indian men， accounting for more than 10% of all cancer fatalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【8】The tongue is the second most prevalent cancer in India af-ter buccal mucosa.

AARs for mouth cancer among females in the 70-75 age range were highest in the northeast and central regions， at 60.2% and 37.2%， respectively. Males in the 60 to 69-year age group in the north had the highest risk of acquiring tongue cancer (58.4%)， while those in the 70 to 75-year age group in the northeast had the lowest risk (37.2%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【13】The most frequent cause of this high frequency is related to the widespread use of tobacco chewing. The other causes are smoking， drinking alcohol， and a lower socioeconomic status， which results in several risk factors， such as lower educational attainment， a lack of social support， and poor financial assistance通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>. Additionally， HPV infection is a significant contributor among young patients. It is well known that the higher the stage， the poorer the prognosis. It has also been studied that socioeconomic status is one of the factors leading to higher stages at diagnosis and， thus， poor prognosis. In India， a developing nation where a lower SES population huge， thus are problems with reaching health facilities， resulting in late diagnosis， which leads to advanced-stage diagnosis at a much higher rate than in other countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9， 10\\]</u>. Moreover， the reasons are myriad for this status， with the contribution of patients and， to a lesser extent， the medical fraternity.\n\n【14】This 12-month randomised comparative study was carried out in the radiotherapy and ENT departments of Lok Nayak hospi-tal， Patna， India. Clinically locally advanced (inoperable) and histopathologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma patients who were unsuitable for curative treatment made up the re-search population.\n\n【15】This retrospective study examined the effectiveness of vari-ous radiation therapy fractionation schedules for the palliation of head and neck cancer. Between January 2016 and Septem-ber 2022， sixty patients with palliative irradiation to primary head and neck locations were examined. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) protocol 85-02， the most widely used fractionation regimen， was intended to deliver 440 cGy utilising370 cGy fractionation， administered twice daily for 2 consecu-tive days at 2-to 3-week intervals for 3 total cycles. The rates of palliative response were 83%，77%，67%，86%， and 60% among those treated using the RTOG regimen， 7000 cGy/35 fractions，3000 cGy/10 fractions， 3750 cGy/15 fractions， and 2000 cGy/5fractions， respectively (p=.42). Nine percent (2/23) of those treated with the RTOG regimen developed grade 3+ toxicity compared with 37% among those treated with other schedules(p=.01). All of the schedules examined were successful at pro-viding palliation. However， the RTOG 85-02 regimen was less hazardous. This study compares the clinical outcomes of two hy-pofractionated palliative radiation regimens for head and neck malignancies that are terminal.\n\n【16】Inclusion criteria\n\n【17】Patients meeting all criteria listed below will be included in the study\n\n【18】·Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with histopathological confirmation\n\n【19】· clinical stage IVA/B\n\n【20】· age range-18 to 70\n\n【21】· Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scores of less than 3.\n\n【22】·Normal haematological and biochemical parameters，i.e. normal liver and kidney function tests (GFR> 60ml/min； AST <2.5 ULN and S.

Quantitative data has been ex-pressed as a median and inter-quartile range， with the Wilcoxon rank test for unpaired data and the Mann Whitney U'test for paired data detecting significant differences. Qualitative data are expressed as percentages or proportions， and Fisher’s exact test results show significant variations between the proportions，\n\n【31】with a p-value of 0.05 or below being regarded as statistically significant.\n\n【32】Ethical Considerations\n\n【33】1\\. The objectives and procedure of the study were explained to all the respondents.\n\n【34】2\\. A patient information sheet (Annexure 1) was given to all the respondents participating in the study describing the objectives， methods， and the procedure to be followed. Informed consent (Annexure 2) was taken from all respon-dents willing to participate in the study.\n\n【35】The data collected is to be used for the study purpose only.\n\n【36】The option to opt out of the study was kept open without any clause.\n\n【37】5\\. Complete confidentiality regarding patient information was maintained through all stages of the study\n\n【38】Results\n\n【39】A total of 46 patients were enrolled in the trial； 6 were excluded(2 died before treatment began，1 had a disturbed kidney func-tion test， and 2 were above 70). The remaining patients were randomly assigned to arms A (Christie) and B (Quad shot)， each with 20 patients.\n\n【40】33 males (83%) and 7 females (17%) participated in this study， showing that men are more likely than women to have such advanced instances. Our study's participants had a median age of 54， a maximum age of 70， and a minimum age of 35. Most patients were between the ages of 55 and 65， whereas the age group of 30-38 years had the fewest patients.\n\n【41】The study population comprises patients registered at our Lok Nayak hospital， Patna. The study population constituted Patna residents (43%) and non-Patna residents (57%)，which can indirectly indicate the rural population. In our study population， all patients (100%) had pain from mild to severe grade， with a median pain score of 7 and median performance status of 2 at presentation and median duration of symptoms being 4 months(maximum-4 years and minimum-20 days).\n\n【42】Out of 40， only 47.5%通用删除7(英):<u>(19)</u> patients completed the planned treatment. The reason for it is cord sparing not feasible in 6， progression of disease while on treatment in 4， development of fistula in 2， poor general condition (ECOG-4) in 1， lost to follow-up 5， and 3 died on treatment. Also， grade 3+ toxicities were recorded in 15/40 (37.5%) of the study population. (2 skin， 3mu-cositis， 7 dysphagia， 2 laryngitis，1 anaemia) . However， there were no incidences of neutropenia or thrombocytopenia.\n\n【43】There was an overall improvement in quality of life (87.5%) in our study population and also improvement in pain (78.13%)， speech (62.5%)and global health status (87.5%)， but there was no significant change in weight and feeding tube dependence was either not changed (48%) or worsened (38%) as reported by the majority of patients who filled the QoL questionnaire. However， there was a worsening in physical and role functioning and xerostomia \n\n【44】Discussion\n\n【45】Locally advanced head and neck cancer constitutes a major part of the population reporting our centre and the majority of other centres in developing countries. In such a huge part， deciding over palliative and curative-intent treatment is an important part of treatment decisions which also decides the prognosis\n\n【46】Table 1\n\n| Grade 3+ reactions  | Christie  | Quad shot  | Total  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Skin  | 2(10%)  | 0  | 2(5%)  |\n| Mucositis  | 3(15%)  | 0  | 3(7.5)  |\n| Salivary Gland  | 0  | 0  | 0  |\n| Dysphagia  | 5(25%)  | 2(10%)  | 7(17.5%)  |\n| Laryngitis  | 1(5%)  | 1(5%)  | 2(5%)  |\n| Anaemia  | 1(5%)  | 0  | 1(2.5%)  |\n|  | 12(60%)  | 3(15%)  | 15(37.5%)  |\n\n【48】Table 2\n\n|  | lmprovement  | No change  | Worsening  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Physical functioning  | 12  | 1  | 19  |\n| Role functioning  | 8  | 0  | 24  |\n| Social functioning  | 11  | 8  | 13  |\n| Global health status  | 28  | 2  | 1  |\n| Pain  | 25  | 4  | 3  |\n| Swallowing  | 15  | 2  | 15  |\n| Dryness of mouth  | 3  | 7  | 22  |\n| Speech  | 20  | 5  | 7  |\n| Social eating  | 16  | 8  | 8  |\n| Social contact  | 16  | 3  | 13  |\n| Weight gain  | 13  | 19  | 0  |\n| Feeding tube  | 4  | 15  | 12  |\n| Weight loss  | 10  | 20  | 1  |\n\n【50】of patients. This can also be a very subjective decision from a physician's point of view. As the population in this study were all either stage IVA or IB， the chance for this ambiguity is some-what dealt with (but still there can be a tendency for curative intent treatment by some physicians). As is quite evident from the study done by Al-mamgani et al.， the study population was comprised of stage I-IVC， with different reasons for selection(high age， poor performance status， synchronous malignancy， metachronous malignancy， uncontrolled co-morbidities etc.) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，12\\]</u>.\n\n【51】In our study population， satisfactory results were obtained， but there was a failure to establish the superiority of one regime over another. This result is somewhat similar to the study done by Chen et al.， where no conclusive results were obtained for comparison. However， a significant part of the study popula-tion (77%) has significantly benefitted regarding palliation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Similarly， in our study population， palliation in pain was 78%. Also， our results are similar to Chen et al.， where the median pain score before treatment was 7， and it came to 3 after treat-ment. Even our results were comparable in respect of more than75% subjective response in 20% population， 35% with subjective response in the 50-75% range and 77 45% population with a response less than 50% with the study done by Aggarwal et al. where this number was (17%， 57% and 26% respectively).\n\n【52】The median overall survival in our study population was7.1 months， and the median progression-free survival was 6.6months. This result was comparable to the study done by Fortin et al.， where the median overall survival and progression-free survival (6.5 months and 3.2 months， respectively) were similar to our study.\n\n【53】There was an overall improvement in quality of life (87.5%)in\n\n【54】our study population and also an improvement in pain (78.13%)， speech (62.5%) and global health status (87.5%). However， there was no significant change in weight， and feeding tube depen-dence was either not changed (48%) or worsened (38%)， as re-ported by most patients who filled out the QoL questionnaire. However， there was a worsening in physical and role function-ing and xerostomia. This was in sync with the results of studies like Ghoshal et al.， Al-mamgani et al.， Corry et al.， Pearson et al.， and Porceddu et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14， 15，16，17，18\\]</u>.\n\n【55】Our study had a small sample size due to the limited time available to complete this study. Poor compliance rate， especially quad shot arm where the patient was off any treatment during the gap between two phases which was the cause of progression in many cases of our study as well as it can be considered that patients may be on some off-label medications (confounding factors) in that duration which could have affected our results. The other limitation was the treatment by cobalt-60 machines(where no posterior triangle boost was feasible if electron ther-apy would have been a good option when cord sparing was not feasible) which led to the termination of treatment in our study population. Also， there were some interruptions due to holidays in the hospital and patient compliance with timely investigations.\n\n【56】Conclusion\n\n【57】Overall both the palliative regimes (Christie and Quad shot) are very effective for palliation in such inoperable locally advanced head and neck cancer patients. The toxicity was higher in the Christie regime than in the Quad shot arm. There was a sig-nificant improvement in patient's quality of life in both arms，\n\n【58】and the difference between the two was not statistically signifi-cant. In selected patients， the Christie regime could be equally beneficial in treatment to achieve a complete response.\n\n【59】Conflicts of Interest Nil.\n\n【60】Source of Support Nil.\n\n【61】通用结尾删除-1:<u>References</u>\n\n【62】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

A 74-year-old female patient presented with worsening dyspnea during daily activities. She underwent a right single-lung transplantation for emphysema 27 years ago. Despite recurrent episodes of acute rejection of the grafted lung， the patient had satisfactory recovery of physical fitness during that period and did not report any serious complications or respiratory symptoms. Her recent dyspnea was due to hyperinflation of the native emphysematous lung with mediastinal shift， reduction of venous blood return， and compression of the graft-ed lung. Although surgical lung volume reduction had resulted in temporary functional improvement 2 years ago， a completion contralateral pneumonectomy was deemed necessary to allow re-expansion of the grafted lung. After anesthesia induction and placement of a double-lumen tube， selective ventilation of the left em-physematous native lung confirmed the absence of gas exchange based on near-zero end-expiratory carbon dioxide fraction. During selective ventilation of the grafted lung， satisfactory gas exchange was achieved and pneumonectomy proceeded uneventfully under minimally-invasive thoracotomy. Immediately after anesthe-sia emergence and tracheal extubation， the patient experienced respiratory improvement. Continuous thorac-ic epidural blockade allowed pain-free mobilization and respiratory therapy to facilitate re-expansion of the grafted lung.\n\n【22】Conclusions：\n\n【23】After single-lung transplantation in COPD patients， native lung hyperinflation is a well-described rare compli-cation. Lung volume reduction including pneumonectomy can be considered a valuable treatment option.\n\n【24】Keywords： Emphysema · Pneumonectomy· Lung Transplantation\n\n【25】Abbreviations：\n\n【26】BLT - bilateral lung transplant； COPD - chronic obstructive pulmonary disease； CT - computed tomog-raphy； DLCO- carbon oxide diffusing capacity； ETCO， -end-tidal CO。 FEV1 - forced expiratory volume in 1 second； Fio，-inspiratory oxygen fraction； FVC - forced vital capacity； IV-intravenous；OLV-one-lung ventilation； PFT- pulmonary functional test； Sa0，-arterial oxygen saturation； SLT-single-lung transplant\n\n【27】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/936748\n\n【28】三国1630 盟3 山 2 斗国20\n\n【29】Lung transplantation improves survival and quality of life of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Given the shortage of donor lungs and the risk of death due to a prolonged waiting period， offering onel pair of donor lungs for 2 candidates is an efficient way to optimize donor organs distribution based on medical urgency and recipient demographic parameters 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Short- and long-term survival after single and bilateral lung transplant (SLT， BLT) are quite similar in patients older than 65 years， whereas functional pa-rameters related to lung volume capacity and diffusion capac-ity， as well as exercise tolerance and health-related quality of life， are better at all follow-up times in patients undergoing BLT compared to SLT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【30】Besides allograft dysfunction and surgical complications that occur within the first weeks following lung transplantation， non-small cell lung carcinoma and progressive hyperinfla-tion can develop later in the native emphysematous lung 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Thoracic surgery with one-lung ventilation (OLV) is particular-ly challenging in patients with severe emphysema owing to dynamic gas trapping and alterations in hemodynamics that\n\n【31】Table 1.

After sever-al episodes of acute graft rejection， she exhibited marked im-provement in pulmonary functional tests (PFTs) with adequate recovery of her physical fitness. Over the last 4 years， the im-mune tolerance to the SLT was well controlled under low dos-es of prednisone (5 mg) and tacrolimus (1 mg)， but she had increasing dyspnea on mild exercise， attributed to hyperinfla-tion of the native lung. In May 2019， she underwent non-an-atomical lung volume reduction under video-assisted thoracic surgery， which resulted in temporary functional improvement. In July 2021， although gas exchange was satisfactory at rest， this 74-year-old patient was referred to our hospital with se-vere dyspnea (Borg dyspnea score 8/9)， and walking limitation\n\n| Spirometry parameters  | Preoperative  | % of reference value  | Z score  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| FEV1 (L)  | 0.56  | 29%  | \\-3.93  |\n| FVC (L)  | 0.93  | 37%  | \\-3.87  |\n| SVC(L)  | 0.98  | 39%  | \\-3.71  |\n| FEV1/FVC(%)  | 61  | 78%  | \\-2.00  |\n| FEV1/SVC (%)  | 57  | 73%  | \\-2.37  |\n| PEF (L/s)  | 1.38  | 26%  | \\-4.36  |\n| FEF25-75 (L/s)  | 0.26  | 16%  | \\-3.04  |\n| Volumes (plethysmography)  |  |  |  |\n| TLC (L)  | 5.29  | 116%  | 1.19  |\n| RV(L  | 4.22  | 209%  | 6.28  |\n| RV/TLC (%)  | 80  | 183%  | 6.20  |\n| FRC(L  | 4.43  | 171%  | 3.68  |\n| Carbon dioxide (CO) diffusion capacity (DL)  |  |  |  |\n| DLCO (Mmol/kPa/min)  | 1.63  | 27%  | \\-8.53  |\n| DLCO(Hb) (Mmol/kPa/min)  | 1.76  | 30%  | \\-7.90  |\n| Kco (Mmol/kPa/min/l)  | 1.24  | 88%  | \\-0.82  |\n| Kco(Hb) (Mmol/kPa/min/l)  | 1.34  | 95%  | \\-0.32  |\n| Hb (g/dl)  | 11.1  |  |  |\n\n【36】FEV1 -forced expiratory volume in the first second； FVC- forced vital capacity； SVC - slow vital capacity； PEF-peak expiratory flow； FEF25-75%-forced expiratory flow at 25 and 75% of the pulmonary volume； TLC - total lung capacity； RV- residual volume； FRC - functional residual capacity； DLCO - diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide； DLCO(Hb) - DLCO adjusted for hemoglobin； Kco -carbon monoxide transfer coefficient； Kco (Hb)- Kco adjusted for hemoglobin； Hb- hemoglobin.\n\n【37】(<10 m)， unresponsive to oxygen therapy. Echocardiography revealed normal left ventricular ejection fraction with no sign of pulmonary arterial hypertension. As summarized in Table 1， the PFTs confirmed a pattern of severe lung hyperinflation and non-reversible flow obstruction along with limitation in carbon oxide diffusing capacity (27% predicted value). The plain chest radiography and thoracic computed tomography scan showed bullous emphysema of the native left lung， causing rightward mediastinal deviation and compression of the grafted lung， as well as the vena cava and the heart . Lung scin-tigraphy showed very low flow in the left lung (<6% of car-diac output) with thromboembolic occlusion of the inferior left lobar artery.

During the 3 weeks preceding surgery， the patient’s physical condition was optimized through daily home ses-sions of volume incentive spirometry， deep breathing exer-cise， and muscle strengthening of the upper and lower limbs using elastic bands. Psychological support was also provided by her family and regular phone calls with physiotherapists and the medica.team.\n\n【41】Before surgery， nebulized salbutamol was administered and the patient was equipped with a thoracic epidural catheter(T5-T6)， 2 intravenous (i.v.) lines， and a radial artery cathe-ter for blood pressure monitoring. Epidural analgesia was ini-tiated with bupivacaine 0.25% and fentanyl 0.002%(bolus of6 ml) and maintained throughout surgery (5 ml/h). General anesthesia was induced with sufentanil (10 mcg)， etomidate(20 mg)， and rocuronium (30 mg). A double-lumen tube was inserted and proper positioning was confirmed by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. During selective ventilation through the trache-al port， the end-tidal CO， (ETCO，) dropped to near 0， where-as during selective ventilation through the bronchial port， ETCO， stabilized at around 4.5% and arterial oxygen satu-ration (SaO，) was 98-100% with an inspiratory oxygen frac-tion (FiO，) of 0.8.

Pressure-controlled volume-guaranteed ventilation (Aisys CS2 workstation， GE Healthcare) was initiated after perform-ing an alveolar recruitment maneuver and setting a tidal vol-ume of 5.5 ml/kg of predicted body weight. A positive end-expiratory pressure of 7 cmH，O was selected， which achieved the highest lung compliance. The inspiratory： expiratory ratio(1： 2) and respiratory rate (14/min) were adjusted to allow complete alveolar emptying and normocapnia. Right pneumo-nectomy was carried out through an antero-lateral intercostal approach. Hemodynamics， oxygenation index (SaO，/FiO，)and ETCO， remain within normal physiological range， even follow-ing clamping of the right pulmonary artery . At the end of a 70-min uneventful procedure， complete recovery of the neuromuscular block was confirmed (Train-Of-Four ratio >0.9 upon stimulation of the ulnar nerve). The estimated blood loss was less than 150 ml and 650 ml i.v. crystalloids was giv-en. After a last alveolar recruitment maneuver， the patient was extubated and transferred to the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit.\n\n【46】Postoperatively， the patient reported immediate improve-ment in spontaneous breathing， with normocapnia and satis-factory oxygenation ， while chest X-rays showed re-expansion of the grafted lung and a shift of the trachea and heart to a more central position. The chest tube was removed6 h postoperatively and 4 h later the chest radiogram demon-strated fluid accumulation in the left pleural cavity \n\n【47】that required a thoracocentesis to remove 500 ml of clear flu-id with no evidence of infection. On the third day after sur-gery， the onset of atrial fibrillation required pharmacological cardioversion (amiodarone 300 mg i.v.). The patient was dis-charged to a rehabilitation center on the tenth postoperative day. One month later， her 6-minute walking capacity had in-creased above 300 m and she had full autonomy in her dai-ly functional activities.\n\n【48】Discussion\n\n【49】According to the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Registry， SLT is performed in up to 40% of patients with end-stage COPD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Native lung hyperinfla-tion compressing the grafted lung represents a unique com-plication that develops in 5-30% of COPD patients following SLT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. Dead space ventilation， restricted functional alve-olar areas， and impaired venous blood return all contribute to produce dyspnea， respiratory muscle fatigue， and poor ex-ercise capacity. Several case series have reported functional improvements after surgical lung volume reduction that was associated with high early morbidity (eg， infection， air leaks， and renal failure) requiring intensive care， and reduced sur-vival at 1 year (58%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【50】Contralateral pneumonectomy after SLT has been reported in only 3 patients (ages 46， 56， and 66 years  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9-11\\]</u>. Intractable air leak was incriminated in 1 case (17 days after SLT) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> and progressive hyperinflation of the native lung in the other 2 patients (3 years and 12 years after SLT) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>. In our patient， clinical improvement was achieved transiently after lung volume reduction and she underwent completion pneumonectomy 27 years after right SLT.\n\n【51】Preoperatively， the expected clinical benefits associated with removal of the native hyperinflated lung lead the multidisci-plinary board involving thoracic surgeons， anesthesiologists， and chest physicians to propose a pneumonectomy via a min-imally-invasive thoracotomy. Pulmonary hypertension， signifi-cant cardiovascular disease (eg， heart failure and coronary ar-tery disease) or other organ failure (eg， liver and kidney) that could have contraindicated surgery were absent， and the fully\n\n【52】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2.

Besides ad-vanced age， immunosuppression， and poor pulmonary function， muscular deconditioning was the only potentially reversible risk factor. Accordingy， a home-based physical training program with psychological support was initiated 3 weeks before surgery to empower the patient as an active partner in her health care process and to strengthen respiratory muscles to prevent post-operative pulmonary complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. To reduce the admin-istration of opiates and allow a smooth anesthesia emergence， thoracic epidural analgesia was used intraoperatively and was continued in the early postoperative period to facilitate re-ex-pansion of the grafted lung with exercise 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Alternatively， a paravertebral thoracic block might have been considered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Inhalational anesthesia was preferred to intravenous anesthet-ics given the bronchodilating and organ preconditioning effects of volatile anesthetic agents resulting in fewer postoperative pulmonary and neurocognitive disturbances 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16，17\\]</u>. After anes-thesia induction， the lungs were isolated with a double-lumen tube and the sharp drop end-tidal Co。 while ventilating the left native lung confirmed the absence of blood flow through the left pulmonary artery and total non-functionality of the left lung. On the grafted right lung， an open protective ventilatory strategy was applied， including low V， titrated PEEP， and al-veolar recruitment maneuver to minimize ventilation-induced lung injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.

Several causes of NP are traumatic， metabolic disorders， ischemia， toxins， infections， immune-related， and hereditary. The pathophysiology of NP is very complicated and unknown entirely. Therefore the treatment of NP is still unsatisfactory. Recent studies believed the critical role of primary inflammatory mediators in the pathophysiology of NP especially leukotrienes (LTs). The 5-lipoxygenase enzyme (5-LOX) is an enzyme that plays a role in the metabolism of arachidonic acid into LTs. Leukotrienes(LTs) are the essential inflammatory mediators in the pathophysiology of NP. Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) can cause chemotaxis on neutrophils， lowering nociceptors threshold and may contribute to NP. Several studies believed the administration of5-LOX inhibitors or LIs receptor antagonists could be useful in the management of NP. The purpose of this review is to summarize the involvement of 5-LOX enzyme as an essential role in the pathophysiology and management of NP.\n\n【5】KEYWORDS 5-lipoxygenase， leukotrienes， pathophysiology of neuropathic pain，inflammatory mediators， management of neuropathic pain\n\n【6】1.INTRODUCTION\n\n【7】Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience related to actual or potential tissue damage or described by the damage.

There is increased activation of periph-eral immune cells in nerve injury-induced NP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. They are recognized as elicited nociceptive neurotransmitters and media-tors (glutamate， substance P，adenosine triphosphate， fractalkine， etc.) that are released from sensitized primary afferent terminals and activate spinal microglia and astrocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【17】There are two critical enzymes in the inflammation process， cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzyme， and 5-LOX enzyme. Many pre-vious studies have focused only on the COX pathway， and most of the anti-inflammatory drugs work only by blocking the COX pathway. the 5-LOX enzyme is not less critical than COX enzyme in the inflammation process. Both enzymes metabolize arachi-donic acid into prostaglandins (PGs) by COX 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> and into LTs by5-LOX 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Prostaglandins (PGs) and LTs are pro-inflammatory mediators that induce pain symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Some studies indicate inhibition of the COX pathway may even increase arachidonic acid metabolism via the 5-LOX pathway that releases more of LTs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Therefore，by inhibiting the COX pathway alone does not seem to be able to relieve pain completely. The objective of this review is to summarize the function of 5-LOX based on various studies in pathophysiology and management of NP.\n\n【18】There are several risk factors and causes of NP. Neuropathic pain (NP) is associated with neurological disorders of both pe-ripheral and central nervous system. It manifests as a persistent burning pain with spontaneous and worsening exacerbations upon normal causing an impact on the quality of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The damaged nerve can develop into NP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The mechanism of NP is very complicated， and it is difficult to determine what conditions could be a definite cause of NP. The leading causes of NP include traumatic， metabolic disorders， ischemia， toxins， infections， immune-related and hereditary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【19】The prevalence of NP increases with age and severity of un-derlying disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Purwata et al. were reported the higher prevalence of NP in 41-60 years old (n=1，030；57，9%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Several studies have found a significant association between the inci-dence of NP with worse physical， mental and social health. In France， Smith et al.， were reported a decreased quality of life， sleep and increased the incidence of psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression in patients with NP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Widiastuti et al.， study 50 patients with 66% proportion of woman with mean age 67，40 ±6，80 years old. The proportion of NP 44% and 58%have poor sleep quality. They reported， 42% of the samples have NP with poor sleep quality there is a significant relationship between NP and poor quality of sleep in the elderly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. In diabetic patients with smoking habits， hypertension， hyperc-holesterolemia， obesity and long duration of diabetes increase the risk of peripheral diabetic neuropathy (PDN). Risk factors EurOD for the occurrence of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) include el-der subjects of herpes zoster infections， immunocompromised and severe herpes zoster infections. The risk of PHN has de-creased by prevention of herpes zoster infection； Zoster vaccine administration reduced the incidence of PHN by up to 66%. The prevention of HIV infection through education and sexual health promotion are vital to reducing the occurrence of HIV-associated peripheral sensory neuropathy (HIV-SN) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【20】3.MAJOR INFLAMMATORYMEDIATORS AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES IN PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF NP\n\n【21】Several studies believed the involvement of inflammatory condi-tions behind the occurrence of NP通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17，18\\]</u>. Nowadays many re-searches are focused on the role of inflammatory mediators such as lipid mediators (PGs and LTs)， chemokines and cytokines in the pathophysiology of pain. In the peripheral nervous system， after nerve injury， inflammatory mediators are hyper-regulated by resident cells and infiltrate leucocytes that induce periph-eral sensitization. In the central nervous system， glial cells in spinal cord activated by inflammatory mediators induce central sensitization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Inflammatory mediators are released both by infiltrative and resident immune system cells and by glial cells with immune function， which activate or sensitize nociceptors，leading to aber-rant nociceptive system activity. Chemical pro-inflammatory mediators may act on adjacents glial cells and increasing mi-gration of immune system cells， inducing the distant release of more mediators. Painful phenomenon increasing list of inflam-matory mediators including bradykinin， eicosanoids (PGs and LTs)， adenosine triphosphate (ATP)， histamine， cytokines inflam-matory， chemokines， neurotrophins and oxygen reactive species. Inflammatory chemical mediators are released in injured tissue by activated cells which coordinate the inflammatory response\n\n【23】process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Anti-inflammatory mediators such as immune cell-derived endorphins，anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-10， IL-10 and transforming growth factor beta， TGFB)， and some neurotrophic factors (glial neurotropic factor， GNF) show antag-onist effects to inflammatory pain mediators 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【24】4.THE ROLE OF 5-LOXIN PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF NP\n\n【25】The 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) enzyme is an enzyme that metabo-lizes arachidonic acid into LTs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Leukotrienes (LTs) are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. We will review the functions of the 5-LOX enzyme and their associa-tion in the pathophysiology of NP. The 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) enzyme can be found on inflammatory cells such as leucocytes， basophils， mast cells， polymorphonuclear， and macrophages. When cell damage occurs， it activates the phospholipase A2enzyme thereby releasing arachidonic acid from phospholipid membrane. After the arachidonic acid is released， it will be me-tabolized by two significant enzymes， COX enzyme， and 5-LOX enzyme. The 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) enzyme is activated first by 5-LOX activating protein (FLAP)， which metabolizes arachi-donic acid into leukotriene A4 (LTA4) \\[2J. LTA4 )hydrolase will metabolize leukotriene A4 (LTA4) into LTB4 or by leukotriene C4 (LTC4) synthase into LTC4. Leukotriene C4 (LTC4) will be converted into leukotriene D4 (LTD4) and leukotriene E4 (LTE4). Leukotriene C4 (LTC4)， LTD4， and LTE4 are called cysteinyl leukotrienes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Leukotrienes (LTs) action with specific receptors in the glial cells and several immune cells. BLT1 is receptors with high affin-ity for LTB4， while BLT2 binds LTB4 and other LTs as lower affinity， CisLT1 and 2 binds CystLTs as a selective receptor. Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) had a chemotactic response of neutrophils and indicated the involvement of LTB4 in the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases. Several LTs are released such as 8R and 15S-diHETE that produce hyperalgesia by intraplantar LTB4injections， which lowering nociceptors threshold and may con-tribute to NP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The rats spared nerve injury (SNI) have been shown the increasing of LTs synthesis and expression on CystLT1receptors in the spinal microglia， which may lead to NP. Admin-istration of CystLT receptor antagonists can inhibit microglia activation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【27】5\\. THE ROLE OF 5-LOX IN MANAGEMENT OF NP\n\n【28】Most people with NP experienced life-long pain； this is because the pathophysiology of NP is very complicated and not yet fully known 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Neuropathic pain (NP) often do not respond to con-ventional analgesics treatment. Drugs that are commonly used in treating NP include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs)， narcotic analgesics， opioid，anticonvulsants， and tri-cyclic antidepressants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Leukotrienes (LTs) can cause symptoms associated with in-flammation including pain， so inhibitors of 5-LOX and LTs recep-tor antagonists may have therapeutic value in pain management. The pain models have proven the administration of zileuton(active inhibitor of 5-LOX) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> and montelukast (LT receptor antagonists) can reduce the symptom of pain in NP. Adminis-tration CystLT receptor antagonists can cause inactivation of mi-croglia， thus lowering LIs synthesis and expression on CystLT1receptors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Pranlukast (cysteinyl-leukotriene receptor-1 an-tagonists) can decrease inflammation in the dorsal root ganglia POOTg(DRG) in patients with PHN. Montelukast may decrease hyper-algesia in children and adolescents accompanied by dyspepsia and duodenal eosinophilia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【30】Prostaglandins (PGs) and LTs have a synergistic effect on the occurrence of pain symptom. The administration of both inhibitor of 5-LOX (zileuton) and NSAIDs (indomethacin) also synergistically decrease hyperalgesia compared to either alone通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. So the combined inhibitors of both prostaglandin and leukotriene would have benefits over existing drugs.\n\n【31】Eicosanoids are numerous family of compounds with high potency and broad biological activity spectrum. Arachidonic acid， one of the constituents of cell membranes， is the most im-portant precursor of eicosanoids. After released from cell mem-branes， the arachidonic acid will be amenable to oxygenated. A state of injury or degeneration may increase the likelihood of arachidonic acid to be metabolized，and the metabolites outcome is a sign that noxious or potentially noxious stimuli. There are four central pathways in arachidonic acid metabolism， i.e.，by COX， LOX， isoprostane， and epoxygenase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【32】Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioid analgesics are widely used to treat pain， but there are many adverse side effects. Many studies have researched to find safer analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug formulations \\[71. The researches are developing an alternative natural medicine. Some medicinal plants are believed to have analgesic and anti-inflammatory potential even with or without small side effects通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Some of which are Curcuma longa rhizome extract and Boswellia serrata extract. Both of those medicinal plants have anti-inflammatory effects with a slightly different way of phar-macodynamics. Curcuma longa rhizome extract works as a COX-2 blocker， which inhibits the formation of prostaglandins. Boswellia serrata extract inhibits the release of inflammatory mediators such as LTs. Both of those medicinal plants have been used to manage NP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. In the future， natural medicine treat-ment is necessary to be considered in NP management related to the absence of adverse side effects， but it still needs further researches on the usefulness.\n\n【33】6\\. CONCLUSION\n\n【34】Neuropathic pain (NP) is commonly associated with inflam-mation. The pathophysiology of NP is very complicated and unknown entirely. Due to its complex pathophysiology，there-fore the treatment of NP is still unsatisfactory. It has beenknown that LTs (LTB4， LTC4，LTD4，LTE4) play a role in the pathophys-iology of NP. Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) can cause chemotaxis to neutrophils and produce hyperalgesia which decreases of no-ciceptors threshold and may contribute to NP. Some clinical studies have proven the administration inhibitors of 5-LOX and antagonists receptor of LTs can decrease hyperalgesia. Based on the involvement of 5-LOX to produce LTs in the pathophysi-ology of NP， maybe in the future the 5-LOX and LTs inhibitors can be a useful alternative therapy for patients with NP. Some medicinal plants are known to have anti-inflammatory effects such as Curcuma longa rhizome extract and Boswellia serrata extract. The advantage of using natural anti-inflammatory in NP treatment is the absence of side effects compared to other chemical drugs.

Epiglottitis complicated by abscess is rare， and emphysematous abscess is even less common. Early diagnosis and intervention is paramount in reducing morbidity and mortality. Although case reports ex-ist， photographic depiction of this complication is not readily available.\n\n【15】Case Report： We present the case of a 59-year-old male with rapidly progressive emphysematous epiglottitis managed with awake fiber optic intubation followed by incision， drainage， and antibiotic therapy. Early recognition and inter-vention in this patient led to complete resolution of the infection， with no long-term sequelae.\n\n【16】Conclusions：\n\n【17】Clinicians should be familiar with the radiographic and endoscopic findings which support an emphysematous abscess， as well as the treatment and airway management concerns in such cases.\n\n【18】MeSH Keywords： Airway Obstruction· Epiglottitis ·Otolaryngology\n\n【19】Full-text PDF http：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/900334\n\n【20】17787 3\n\n【21】4\n\n【22】Acute infectious epiglottitis is a rapidly progressive and poten-tially fatal infection of the upper respiratory tract. Historically， this condition was most commonly seen in children，resulting from Haemophilus influenzae infections. Following the intro-duction of the Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine， there has been a shift in the etiology and epidemiology of epiglotti-tis， with a rise in adult infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Epiglottic abscess for-mation is a rare complication of epiglottitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Epiglottitis complicated by emphysematous abscess formation has been reported even less frequently， and is not well described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Here， we present a case of an otherwise healthy male patient with emphysematous epiglottitis necessitating awake fiber optic intubation and surgical drainage.\n\n【23】Case Report\n\n【24】A 59-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency de-partment (ED) with a one day history of odynophagia and dys-phagia with rapid progression to dysphonia and inability to swallow his oral secretions. He reported having intermittent fevers at home， along with fatigue and a productive cough， but denied any breathing difficulties or stridor. The patient had a long history of smoking， but was otherwise healthy. In the ED， he was afebrile， hypertensive and tachycardic， with a muffled voice quality and productive cough， but no stridor. Physical ex-amination revealed only tender bilateral cervical lymphadenop-athy and pain near the hyoid. Laboratory workup was remark-able for a leukocytosis of 20.2 k/uL with 91% neutrophils. A computed tomography (CT) scan with intravenous (IV) contrast\n\n【25】of the neck was performed and was significant for a marked-ly enlarged epiglottis secondary to submucosal emphysema along the lingual surface . These changes resulted in marked narrowing of the supraglottic airway with sparing of the glottic and subglottic airway. Inflammatory changes also involved the floor of the mouth， oropharynx and hypophar-ynx， with multiple small abscesses noted within the left ven-tral floor of mouth and right palatine tonsil.\n\n【26】Flexible fiber optic laryngoscopy revealed significant pooling of secretions and a diffusely swollen epiglottis， with moderate edema of the remainder of the supraglottis . The vo-cal cords had normal mobility and were not edematous. The patient was taken to the operating room urgently and under-went awake trans-nasal fiber optic intubation followed by di-rect laryngoscopy with biopsy and abscess drainage. Although purulence was encountered， unfortunately no cultures were sent for evaluation. Following decompression of the epiglot-tis， the trans-nasal tube was exchanged for trans-oral size six cuffed endotracheal tube and the patient was left intubated， but breathing spontaneously， and admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). He was treated with Ⅳ ampicillin/sulbactam1.5 grams (1 gram ampicillin plus 0.5 gram sulbactam) every six hours， and l dexamethasone at 6 mg every six hours. He underwent bedside direct laryngoscopy in the ICU approxi-mately 36 hours after his abscess drainage， and this revealed improvement in his supraglottic edema. He was successfully extubated shortly thereafter， the steroids were discontinued， and he was transitioned to oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.800/114 mg twice daily. He was discharged on postoperative day three with an additional ten days of amoxicillin/clavulan-ic acid， 800/114 mg twice daily. He was fully recovered when\n\n【27】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

In this case， the bulbous nature of the epiglottis necessitat-ed awake fiber optic intubation to avoid further airway com-promise with sedation or supine positioning. Loss of tone and supine positioning may lead to a ball valve mechanism， with complete airway obstruction， and an inability to deliver posi-tive pressure ventilation. In such cases， the neck may also need to be prepped for tracheotomy. Drainage should always take place after the airway has been secured. Mortality in cases of epiglottic abscess can be significantly decreased through ear-ly detection and initiation of broad spectrum antibiotic ther-apy， with transfer to the operating room for airway manage-ment and drainage when indicated.\n\n【39】Conclusions\n\n【40】Clinicians should be familiar with the endoscopic and radio logic findings which support an emphysematous epiglottic ab-scess， as well as the treatment and airway management con-cerns that arise in such cases.\n\n【41】3\\.

Diagnosis is often made intraoperatively when normal pelvic organs are found in surgeries done for ectopic pregnancy. A 31-year-old lady underwent exploratory laparotomy for ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Intraoperatively， 600 ml haemoperitoneum was present， but the uterus， bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries were all normal. After careful surgical exploration， location of ectopic pregnancy was found to be at the omentum.\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Ectopic pregnancy is a fascinating medical condition. The ability of the embryo to implant onto structures other than the normal endometrial lining is simply astounding. About 95-96% of ec-topic pregnancy is implanted to the fallopian tube 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>， and this is not surprising from the perspective of embryonic physi-ology. In some cases， however an ectopic pregnancy occurred at other sites and termed as non-tubal pregnancy. The rarest non-tubal pregnancy relates to implantation at sites throughout the abdomen including omentum， abdominal organs (e.g.， liver， spleen， and bowel)， pelvic cul-de-sac， broad ligament and pelvic sidewall. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> Although rare， it is essential because it has 7-times higher mortality rate compared to the non-abdominal ectopic pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> and 90-times higher mortality rate compared to an intrauterine pregnancy. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>\n\n【8】Here， we report a case of omental pregnancy， and we hope to emphasize the importance of examining the entire abdomen， including the omentum in cases clinically diagnosed as ectopic pregnancy but with normal-looking intraoperative adnexal or-gans.\n\n【9】Copyright @ 2020 by the Bulgarian Association of Young Surgeons\n\n【10】DOI：10.5455/IJMRCR.omental-pregnancy\n\n【11】First Received： April 07， 2020\n\n【12】Accepted： April 17，2020\n\n【13】Associate Editor： Ivan Inkov (BG)；\n\n【14】Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Hospital Sultanah Nur Zahirah， Kuala\n\n【15】Terengganu， Malaysia； Email： drroziana@yahoo.com\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1： Haemorrhagic omental mass 5x5cm.</u>\n\n【17】Case presentation\n\n【18】A 31-year-old Para 2+1 presented to the Emergency Department(ED)， Hospital Sultanah Nur Zahirah， Kuala Terengganu with an acute abdomen. She was a fit and healthy lady previously\n\n【19】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2： Slide showing chorionic villi with few trophoblasts admixed with blood clots.</u>\n\n【20】with no known illnesses. Her previous menses were regular every month， and there was no delay in her menses. Her urine pregnancy test was checked at ED as per protocol for cases of acute abdomen， and it was positive.\n\n【21】Clinically she was pale and tachycardic with a pulse rate of120 beats per minute. Blood pressure was 110/70mmHg. The ab-domen was tender and guarded at the suprapubic area. Vagina examination was essentially normal， with no bleeding seen， and cervical excitation was negative. Other systemic examination were unremarkable. Transabdominal ultrasound revealed an empty uterus with free fluid at the Pouch of Douglas.\n\n【22】Diagnosis of Ectopic Pregnancy was made， and she was then rushed to the operation theatre for exploratory laparotomy. In-traoperatively， 600 ml of haemoperitoneum was present. Upon inspection of the pelvic organs； however， the uterus， both fallop ian tubes and both ovaries were all normal. The initial impres-sion at that time was 'tubal abortion'， and the abortus was most probably in the blood clots， which was already suctioned out. Nevertheless， the surgical team was summoned to exclude other surgical cause of acute abdomen. A further careful exploration into the peritoneal cavity detected a ruptured haemorrhagic'omental mass' measuring about 5x5 cm in between the omen-tal fold . Partial omentectomy was performed， and the mass was removed together and sent for histopathological examination (HPE). The patient was discharged well from the ward several days later， and HPE findings were consistent with a case of Omental Pregnancy .\n\n【23】Discussion\n\n【24】Omental pregnancy is the least common form of abdominal pregnancies. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> It could either be primary or secondary depend-ing on the site of fertilization between the sperm and ovum. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> Studdiford 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> in 1942 set the following criteria for the diagnosis of primary abdominal pregnancy：\n\n【25】· normal tubes and ovaries with no evidence of recent or remote iniury\n\n【26】· absence of any evidence of a uteroperitoneal fistula\n\n【27】· presence of a pregnancy-related exclusively to the peri-toneal surface\n\n【28】· early enough to eliminate the possibility of secondary im-plantation following a primary nidation in the tube.\n\n【29】More than two decades later， Friedrich and Rankin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> mod-ified the stipulated criteria by stating that to be a true primary abdominal pregnancy， the pregnancy should be less than 12weeks of gestation， and the trophoblastic attachments should be related solely to the peritoneal surface. Our patient fulfils the criteria as proposed by these authors.\n\n【30】Secondary abdominal pregnancy， on the other hand， is thought to occur when the aborted tubal pregnancy becomes secondarily implanted in the abdominal cavity. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> Nevertheless， while academically interesting， the distinction between primary and secondary abdominal or omental pregnancy may not make any difference to the management of the condition and consid-ered of limited clinical value. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>\n\n【31】Apart from primary or secondary omental pregnancy， a per-sistent trophoblastic disease with omental implantation is an-other rare condition involving the omentum. It occurs basi-cally iatrogenically the following salpingostomy and in some cases following salpingectomy for ectopic tubal pregnancy. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> Robson et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> opine that argument can be made for post-operative beta-hCG assessment in such cases. As for this patient， beta-HCG was taken immediately after the operation， and was repeated 48 hours later， and the level of serum beta-HCG show remarkable reduction from 5332 IU/L to 1241 IU/L. In any of the above conditions， the affinity of the ectopic gestational tissue to implant in the omentum could probably be due to its rich and abundant blood supply.\n\n【32】Risk factors for abdominal omental pregnancy are the same as for ectopic pregnancy such as the previous history of extrauter-ine pregnancy or tubal surgery (including sterilizations)， pelvic inflammatory disease， assisted reproductive techniques or pres-ence of an intrauterine device. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> This patient， however， does not seem to have any specific risk factors.\n\n【33】Diagnosis of omental pregnancy is not easy as clinical signs are not specific， ultrasound is not always accurate， and even laparoscopy is limited by a narrow visual field and lack of tactile sensation. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> Allibone et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> proposed several distinctive sonographic criteria for the diagnosis of abdominal pregnancy， but many criteria were absent and were not applicable in our case. Diagnosis of omental pregnancy is almost always made during surgery for ectopic pregnancy. Thus， a very high index of suspicion is needed to diagnose this condition. Our case illustrates the importance of having this suspicion. We could have easily missed this diagnosis without an extensive surgical exploration.\n\n【34】Conclusion\n\n【35】Omental pregnancy is a rare event， and successful management requires a high index of suspicion. The possibility of an omental pregnancy should always be considered when pelvic organs are found to be normal in patients undergoing surgery for ectopic pregnancy. It is hoped that by reporting this case， clinicians are aware of this diagnosis in order to minimize morbidity and prevent mortality as well as to avoid litigations.\n\n【36】Patient informed consent\n\n【37】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.\n\n【38】Ethics committee approval\n\n【39】Not applicable in this retrospective case report.\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of interest</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author declare no conflict of interests.

HRS is due to a renal vasoconstriction that results from extreme vasodilatation.It is therefore a functional disorder， not associated with structural kidney damage. On the other hand， end-stage liver diseases are often complicated by massive ascites. Massive ascites may cause abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS)， which includes impairment of renal blood flow， but there are no reports indicating that kid-ney lesions caused by ACS may pathologically contribute to end-stage liver diseases.\n\n【34】Case Report： A 40-year-old man with acute liver failure was admitted to our hospital. He was diagnosed with type 1 HRS and showed ACS at the same time. He died 30 days after admission. There were signs of congestion in the kid-neys upon dissection and advanced erythroid fullness in the renal tubules.\n\n【35】Conclusions：\n\n【36】We report an autopsy case with HRS and ACS diagnosed with a clinical and histopathological consideration of liver and kidney. Further clinical studies are needed to improve management of renal failure in patients with acute liver failure and advanced liver cirrhosis.\n\n【37】MeSH Keywords： Acute Kidney Injury· Hepatorenal Syndrome ·Intra-Abdominal Hypertension\n\n【38】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/904663\n\n【39】日 11 4 5 7 1 山可甘3 19\n\n【40】Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) was originally described in 1863by Flint as an association between liver disease and oligu-ric renal failure in the absence of significant renal histologi cal change 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is characterized by marked reduction in glo-merular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow in patients with liver cirrhosis and hepatic failure in the absence of other causes of renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Renal failure is caused by vasocon-striction resulting from systematic vasodilation， and HRS pa-tients are thought to recover from renal failure after receiv-ing a liver transplant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. However， the mechanisms governing HRS pathology are not completely understood. Abdominal as-cites occurs typically at the end stage of liver failure. Massive ascites also influences intraabdominal pressure (IAP) patho-genesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) results in organ failure， including renal failure. Although elevation of renal parenchymal and renal vein pressure are likely mecha-nisms of renal impairment in ACS patients， oliguria and acute kidney injury (AKl) are early and frequent consequences of ACS and can be present at relatively low levels of IAP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. That is-sue has not been taken into account in the definition of HRS. Song et al. described the role of urea transporter protein with in the state of HRS and ACS by successfully making ACS mu-rine model 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Chang et al. suggested that renal pathologic changes occur due to massive abdominal ascites as gleaned from studying a murine model of cirrhosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However， there are no reports indicating that kidney lesions with massive ab-dominal ascites due to subacute liver failure may pathological-ly contribute to HRS. This autopsy case report serves to high-light kidney pathology when HRS and massive ascites occur.\n\n【41】Case Report\n\n【42】A 40-year-old man with acute liver failure was admitted to our hospital. He had undergone coronary artery bypass graft-ing because of angina pectoris 3 years ago. He had no pre-vious history of renal and liver disease. He had no-smoking history and drank socially. He was previously hospitalized else-where for septic shock due to acute epiglottitis. He recovered from septic shock， but he had unrecoverable liver dysfunc-tion and his hepatic spare ability had decreased. Therefore， he was transferred to our hospital 30 days after the disease onset. On admission， he had severe jaundice and massive as-cites and showed flapping tremor； however， his conscious-ness was lucid. He was severely obese (body weight： 120 kg， body mass index： 41.5). Physica. examination showed a high fever of 38.2℃， pulse of 72 beats/min， and blood pressure of116/70 mm/Hg. Laboratory results showed decreases of pro-thrombin time (38%)， albumin (2.1 g/dL)， and cholinesterase(49IU/L)， and increases of white blood cell count (22 300/puL)， total bilirubin (26.4 mg/dL)， creatinine (2.1 mg/dL)， C-reactive\n\n【43】protein (CRP) (4.1 mg/dL)， and NH， (121 ug/dl) . Computed tomography of the abdomen showed massive as-cites ， and the intraperitoneal and retroperitone-al organ， especially right renal vein， were compressed by the ascites . We diagnosed him with sepsis-associat-ed late-onset hepatic failure and AKIN stage 2. We appropri-ately performed general care and maintained proper circula-tion， breathing， and fluids. Moreover， we performed plasma exchange and administered fresh frozen plasma and albu-min to support his liver function. However， his liver dysfunc-tion did not recover and the kidney function worsened. Serum creatinine increased to 4.1 mg/d! and urine volume gradual-ly decreased. Then， we started noradrenaline for HRS 20 days after admission. We palliatively performed large-volume para-centesis (LVP) with an upper limit of 5 L， and urine volume in-creased after the LVP. However， IAP was continuously high at20 mmHg even after LVP， indicating he had severe ACS. He died 30 days after admission.\n\n【44】We performed an autopsy after obtaining consent from his fam-ily. At the time of death， the amount of abdominal ascites had reached 10 L， even though LVP was performed a few days be-fore. The liver weighed 1973 g with no signs of severe atrophy. There was significant accumulation of neutrophils and severe cholestasis in the bile duct. In the portal area， there was bridging fibrosis and aggregation of Kupffer cells. The primary cause of hepatic failure was thought to be sepsis-associated liver injury.\n\n【45】There were signs of congestion in the kidneys- weight 301 g in the right kidney and 345 g in the left kidney- upon dis-section . Regarding bilateral renal congestion， there were bile casts and advanced erythroid fullness in the renal tubules. There was also swelling in the renal tubules. There was no change in the glomerulus and collecting tubule and no renal fibrosis . When we measured bladder pressure after LVP， it was 20 mmHg， which is in the range of intraab-dominal hypertension (IAH). IAH was due to massive ascites. Additionally， we thought that the observed renal congestion was due to renal vein compression， which was caused by a large quantity of abdominal ascites. Thus， we concluded that this patient had HRS-1 and ACS at the same time.\n\n【46】Discussion\n\n【47】Although liver diseases cause irreversible renal dysfunction， such as hepatitis C virus-induced cryoglobulinemia， membra-noproliferative glomerulonephritis， HRS causes reversible re-nal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>. HRS is difficult to clinically distinguish from primary renal failure. According to the definition of HRS from the International Ascites Club (IAC) proposed in 2007， HRS is divided into 2 types (1 and 2) based on prognosis and clini-cal characteristics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【48】Table 1.

Macroscopic findings of the kidney. Macroscopic findings showed bilateral renal congestion.</u>\n\n【53】The patient had no reaction to rehydration therapy and albu-min administration， and he had no previous history of renal dys-function. He had recovered from bacteremia and his blood pres-sure was maintained. Clinically， he was originally diagnosed as HRS-1. We did not find major evidence of renal tubule necro-sis in the autopsy； otherwise， we found some bile casts caused by elevation of serum bilirubin， which affect renal function. To maintain effective plasma circulation， an albumin infusion is first performed. In addition， albumin treatment is combined with terlipressin as the first-line treatment， or midodrine and nor-adrenaline are used as alternatives \\[101. We administrated nor-adrenaline，which was permitted by health insurance. However， regardless of treatment choice， the effect is temporary， and a liv-ertransplant is the only treatment that can extend patient sur-vival. The 3-year survival rate after a liver transplant of an HRS-1 patient is reported to be 65% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Various factors concern the etiology of HRS， and the definition is corrected as needed. Wong et al. reported new diagnostic criteria of HRS in cirrhosis patients， jointly proposed by the IAC and Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative. In the new criteria， HRS-1 and HRS-2 are both incor-porated in AKl and chronic kidney disease (CKD) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. AKI is a relatively frequent problem， occurring in approximately 20% of hospitalized patients with cirrhosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In the autopsy of this case， both kidneys showed severe renal congestion. ACS is de-fined as hypoperfusion and ischemia of intraabdominal viscera and structures caused by raised IAP. It causes lethal conditions， with acute renal， acute respiratory， and acute circulatory failure. Cade et al. reported a significant increase in urine flow rate and Ccr after reduction in IAP， from 22 to 10 mmHg， with paracente-sis in patients with cirrhosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. ACS is diagnosed upon mea-suring IAP by the pressure transducer and is often found in de-creased eGFR in the presence of ascites in the early stage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. IAP in a normal individual ranges from slightly sub-atmospheric to approximately 6.5 mmHg. Recent studies demonstrated that even at the relatively low IAP of 10-15 mmHg，significant alter-ations in organ function are still observed. In this state， renal\n\n【54】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3.

It is suggested that compression of renal vein is vital in the development renal dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. IAH is the sig-nificant pathological mechanism and independent risk factor in the occurrence and development of HRS.\n\n【56】Conclusions\n\n【57】There are effective treatments of ascites to control IAP accord-ing to pathophysiology. Currently， tolvaptan effectively treats hepatic edema and ascites-related clinical symptoms in liver cirrhosis patients who do not respond sufficiently to conven-tional diuretics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. In the case of acute liver failure and a ter-minal cirrhosis patient， the final lifesaving effort is a liver trans-plant， but while the patient waits for the opportunity， renal dysfunction becomes a high-risk factor affecting survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【58】In liver cirrhosis， because of the dynamic change of blood flow that may cause rupture of esophageal varices and fall in blood pressure， LVP is often avoided. Renal function is reversible for HRS patients as aforementioned， but in the case of liver cirrho-sis， there may be advanced renal insufficiency when massive ascites exists. Thus， we have to take into consideration ACS and ACS-mediated renal dysfunction. For HRS patients， main-tenance of renal function is critical to improve the MELD score and patient survival. Currently， ACS is not mentioned in the def-inition of HRS， but we think， from this case， that the preven-tion of ACS at an early stage is crucial for prevention of HRS.\n\n【59】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of interest</u>\n\n【60】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

This report is of a case of nodular lym-phocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) with a good outcome in a 58-year-old Nigerian HIV-positive man who was being treated with ART.\n\n【20】Case Report：\n\n【21】A 58-year-old HIV-positive man presented to a clinic for evaluation of a left axillary mass. He was diagnosed with HIV in 2005， which was well-controlled by ART. He reported intermittent swelling in the left axillary re-gion for several years. Results of a physical examination were significant for mild tender left anterior axillary lymphadenopathy. He had a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and neck， which showed left axil-lary adenopathy， with the largest measuring 3.5x2.0 cm. A staging positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) showed focal uptake in 2 left axillary lymph nodes with no other sites involved. He un-derwent excision of the left axillary lymph node. Histopathology was consistent with nodular lymphocyte-pre-dominant-type Hodgkin's lymphoma (NLHPL). He underwent radiation therapy with a total dose of 3600 cen-tigray (cGy) according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. The 5-month follow-up PET/CT scan showed no evidence of malignancy.\n\n【22】Conclusions： We present a case of HlV-associated NLHPL that had an indolent course and a good treatment outcome. This case highlights the importance of regular physical examination in HIV patients while on treatment with ART and accurate diagnosis of the cause of lymphadenopathy to prevent extra-nodal spread in cases of lymphoma.\n\n【23】Keywords： Antiretroviral Therapy， Highly Active· HIV· Hodgkin Disease\n\n【24】Ful-text PDE https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/936267\n\n【25】Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is the most common acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining malignancy in human im-munodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients， usually present-ing at an advanced stage and in unusual locations in individ-uals with HIV/AIDS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

The mechanism is believed to be immune restoration characterized\n\n【34】by an increased CD4+ T cell response providing antiapoptotic pathways allowing immune escape by tumor cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Hodgkin lymphoma is the most common non-AlDS-defining malignancy in HIV patients， usually presenting at an advanced stage and in unusual locations in individuals with HIV/AIDS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【35】The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified HL into 2pathological types- nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL and classical HL (cHL) -with cHL type mostly associated with HⅣinfection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.cHL can be further sub-grouped， with the most frequent among patients living with HlV being mixed cellulari-ty， followed by nodular sclerosis and lymphocyte-depleted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In a cohort study involving 104 patients with HL treated with ART， the predominant histologic subtype was mixed cellulari-ty， with most patients presenting with“B\" symptoms and ex-tra-nodal involvements 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Our patient was diagnosed with nodular lymphocyte-predominant type (NLPHL).\n\n【36】NLPHL is an indolent subtype of HL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> accounting for 5% of patients diagnosed with HL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. It is predominantly seen in males and African Americans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The malignant cells seen in NLPHL are referred to as lymphocyte-predominant (LP) cells， which are derived from transformed germinal center B cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Most patients present with advanced-stage disease(Ann Arbor stage III-V)， although the incidence of early-stage disease appears to be increasing in the cART era， and most pa-tients still present with systemic B symptoms and extra-nod-al involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，13\\]</u>. Our patient presented with lymphade-nopathy as the only clinical feature， with no B symptoms or extra-nodal involvement.\n\n【37】Regardless of HIV status， once HL is diagnosed， patients are expected to undergo pretreatment clinical evaluation， which involves detailed history， physical examination， laboratory eval-uation such as complete blood cell count， chemistry tests， CD4count， HIV viral load and viral serologies. Radiographic staging with positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomogra-phy (CT) is also required to identify any extra-nodal involvement.\n\n【38】Diagnosis of HL is made based on tissue biopsy with immuno-phenotypic and morphological analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In NLPHL， histol-ogy findings reveal neoplastic lymphocyte-predominant (LP) cells within the background of cells in nodular growth pattern. LP cells typically have immunophenotypic staining positive for CD-20， BCL-6 (B cell lymphoma)， and epithelial membrane an-tigen (EMA) and are negative for CD-15 and CD-30 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Cells in the background nodular growth pattern can either be Tor B lymphocytes， with immunophenotypic staining positive for\n\n【39】CD3， CD4， CD57， CD21， and CD23 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Our patient was not-ed to have atypical lymphoid cells positive for BCL-6， CD-20， and EMA.\n\n【40】Treatment is based on staging and several prognostic fac-tors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Most patients present with advanced-stage disease and are either treated with chemotherapy or radiation， or a combination of chemotherapy and radiation， along with ART in HIV-positive patients. Our patient had non-bulky early-stage IA NLPHL which involved a single lymph node region， requiring radiation therapy based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【41】In terms of prognosis， several prognostic factors have been found to be associated with HIV-HL. Some of the adverse prognostic factors include histology subtype-MC， presence of systemic symptoms， and extra-nodal involvement， while good prognostic factors identified were CD4 count >100/UL and ART use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Prior to the ART era， the prognosis of HIV-HL was poor； however， since the advent of ART， HIV-HL has had favorable outcomes and survival. A study that compared 83patients with HIV-HL treated with ART and 21 patients with HIV-HL not on treatment found patients on ART had signifi-cantly better outcomes compared to patients not on ART 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Another study compared 159 HIV-positive patients with lym-phoma with non-HIV patients with HL and found that even though high-risk features were associated with HIV-HL pa-tients，the prognosis of these patients treated with cART and chemotherapy was markedly better and was similar to that of non-HIV-infected patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，16\\]</u>. Our patient had LP his-tology， absence of B symptoms， extra-nodal involvement， and high CD4 count， favoring a good outcome.\n\n【42】Conclusions\n\n【43】This report has presented a case of HIV-associated NLHPL that had an indolent course and a good treatment outcome. This case highlights the importance of regular physical examina-tion in HIV patients while on treatment with ART， and accu-rate diagnosis of the cause of lymphadenopathy to prevent extra-nodal spread from lymphoma.\n\n【44】Declaration of Figures’ Authenticity\n\n【45】All figures submitted have been created by the authors who confirm that the images are original with no duplication and have not been previously published in whole or in part.\n\n【46】1\\.

The neoplastic transformation of these struc-tures is very rare and there have been few cases reported in the literature.\n\n【31】Case Report： Syringocystadenoma papilliferum is one of the rarest tumors among benign tumors arising from the cerumi-nous glands. We here report the case of a 72-year-old man with a lesion histologically documented as a syrin-gocystadenoma papilliferum and we review the literature， focusing our attention on clinical features and treat-ment options of benign glandular tumors arising from the external auditory canal.\n\n【32】Conclusions： Syringocystadenoma papilliferum is a rare benign tumor of the ceruminous glands of the external ear canal. Excision biopsy is mandatory for the diagnosis and is the best treatment.\n\n【33】MeSH Keywords： Adenoma， Pleomorphic · Cystadenoma， Serous· Ear Canal\n\n【34】Full-text PDF http：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/902900\n\n【35】Ceruminous glands are modified apocrine glands， located in the cartilaginous two-thirds of the external auditory canal(EAC) in the deepest part of the derma. The degeneration of these glands is very rare and has only occasionally been re-ported in the literature. Some authors believe that benign ce-ruminous gland tumors represent 5.7% of all ear and EAC tu-mors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Others have suggested an even lower frequency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-5\\]</u>. The age of affected patients ranges from 12 to 85 years old， with a mean age of 53 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. No etiological agent has been identified to be involved in ceruminous gland degeneration.\n\n【36】Neoplasms arising from the ceruminal glands of the EAC rep-resent a diagnostic challenge because of their variety in clini-cal and histological manifestations. Firstly， they are rare in hu-mans (but are often described in cats and dogs)，resulting in a difficult diagnosis for general surgical pathologists. Secondly， to add more confusion， many descriptions have been used to describe this kind of tumor， resulting in a variable nomencla-ture that includes synonyms such as hidradenoma， cylindro-ma， mixed tumor of skin， and aural hydradenoma.\n\n【37】The literature on ceruminous benign tumors is limited to case reports and small group cases， and there is a lack of large com-prehensive evaluation.\n\n【38】In this case report we describe the clinical manifestation and histological features of one of the many varieties of cerumi-nous syringocystadenoma papilliferum described in the litera-ture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Adding our case to those already published，there are little more than a dozen cases of syringocystadenoma papil-liferum reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【39】Case Report\n\n【40】A 72-year-old man came to our attention with a left conduc-tive hearing loss that had started at least 3 months earlier. He did not complain of pain， discharge， or other inflammato-ry signs involving the ear. The patient reported hearing loss， but no tinnitus or vertigo. Ear trauma or a history of prior sur-gery were not reported. At physical examination， we found that the external auditory canal was occluded by an oval lesion ris-ing from the posterior canal wall. The maximum diameter was about 1 cm. The consistency was taut-elastic and the skin over the lesion appeared normochromic and normotrophic. The le-sion did not look like an inflammatory polyp， but rather like a neoplasm growing under the skin of the EAC. Because of the suspicion of this diagnosis， we did not suggest medical treat-ment， and instead recommended a computed tomography (CT) of the petrous bone. The CT scan revealed the presence of a10x6 mm oval mass in half of the external part of the poste-rior wall of the EAC， with no signs of bone erosion .\n\n【41】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2. Ceruminous syringocystadenoma papilliferum of the external auditory canal， evaluation with hematoxylin-eosin staining.

(A) Original magnification 25x， (B) original magnification 100x； (C， D) original magnification 250x.</u>\n\n【42】Because there was no indication for medical therapy， only surgical treatment was ordered. The surgical procedure was done under general anaesthesia. A retroauricular incision was made to visu-alize the skin and bone of the posterior canal wall， and the tu-mor was radically removed. The histological examination revealed the presence of a “syringocystadenoma papilliferum\" .\n\n【43】After surgery， the patient said he no longer had hearing loss or other symptoms. At 12 months after surgery， no signs of recurrence were macroscopically evident.\n\n【44】Discussion\n\n【45】All ceruminous tumors arise from the external auditory ca-nal， especially from the outer two-thirds， where the cerumi-nal glands are physiologically located. They infrequently in-vade the mastoid bone， the middle ear， and the skull base 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【46】Ceruminous adenomas contain neoplastic cells arranged in var-ious patterns： glandular， cystic， solid， within the same mass， or variably distributed. It is easy to find a dual cell popula-tion， composed of an inner luminal epithelial layer and a bas-al/myoepithelial layer adjacent to the basement membrane； syringocystadenoma papilliferum specifically contains papil-lary projections into a cystic lumen， lined by a dual cell pop-ulation of benign appearance. Luminal cells frequently reveal prominent apical caps with decapitation secretion， typical of apocrine glands like the ceruminous glands 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【47】The persistent use of unsuitable terms in the literature in ref-erence to ceruminous tumors has led to considerable confu-sion， resulting in incorrect classifications and inappropriate therapies when applied in everyday practice.\n\n【48】Ceruminous syringocystadenoma papilliferum has to be placed among the benign tumors of the external auditory canal，\n\n【49】Table 1.

The possibility of recurrence in case of be-nign tumors， such as ceruminous adenoma and pleomorphic adenoma， seems to be related only to an incomplete surgical excision of the lesion. On the contrary， malignant tumors have a poor prognosis despite radical surgical treatment.\n\n【53】Because of its rarity， the ceruminous syringocystadenoma pap-illiferum has not been reported as a benign glandular tumor of the EAC. To date， only 12 cases of ceruminous syringocystad-enoma papilliferum have been described in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【54】Differential diagnosis of ceruminous adenomas must include adenocarcinoma， neuroendocrine adenoma of the middle ear(NAME)， parotid pleomorphic adenoma， meningioma， and paraganglioma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【55】Radiological studies are mandatory to evaluate ceruminous syringocystadenoma papilliferum.

Ureteral endometriosis (UE) is rare， typified by deep infiltrating endometri-osis involving the ureter and can result in ureteral obstruction， proximal hydroureter， hydronephrosis， and im-pairment of renal function. Symptoms may be insidious and nonspecific and may lead to a prolonged disease course. We describe a patient with UE complicated by hydronephrosis.\n\n【23】Case Report：\n\n【24】A 42-year-old woman was admitted to the Urology Department with the incidental discovery of right hydrone-phrosis. After a thorough examination， she underwent right ureteral mass resection and right ureteral stump anastomosis. The pathology report indicated endometriosis.

Ureteral endometriosis (UE) is a relatively rare form of deeply invasive endometriosis (DIE)， accounting for 0.1-0.4% of endometriosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The incidence of UE has increased in recent years. UE most commonly involves the distal ureter， particularly the left side 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， and is considered an aggressive disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The early symptoms of UE are hid-den and lack specificity， making it often missed and misdiag-nosed， which often leads to prolongation of the disease course. Furthermore， untimely diagnosis and treatment can cause ure-teral dilatation and hydronephrosis， resulting in renal damage. This article analyzes the clinical data of a patient with right ureteral endometriosis with renal pelvis and hydroureter， and discusses its pathogenesis， clinical characteristics， and treat-ment to provide a basis for the diagnosis and treatment of UE.\n\n【29】Case Report\n\n【30】A 42-year-old woman presented with incidental right-sided hydronephrosis and dilated right upper ureter upon physical examination . On further testing， intravenous pyelography (IVP) showed no visualization of the right renal pelvis and ureter. She denied symptoms of urinary frequency， urgency， or hematuria. The patient noted a monthly menstru-al cycle and tolerated painful cramps.\n\n【31】The patient's vital signs were normal. Computed tomography(CT) and contrast-enhanced CT scans showed right kidney and ureteral effusion . Magnetic resonance imaging of the urinary tract (MUR) showed dilation of the right renal pelvis and ureter， but the lower segment of the ureter enter-ing the bladder was not observed . The renal diagram showed that the blood perfusion of the right kidney was significantly reduced (glomerular filtration rate \\[GFR\\]，12.16 mL/min) compared with that of the left kidney， indi-cating severe impairment of right kidney function . Cystoscopy showed a clearly visible right ureteral orifice， no urine ejection， and the insertion of the F-5 ureter for 10 cm was obstructed， suggesting an obstruction.\n\n【32】Laparotomy was then performed under general anesthesia. During the operation， the middle and upper segments of the right ureter were obviously dilated with edema， and the sur-rounding tissues adhered. After sufficient dissociation， the right ureter was found to be narrowed from the level of the right ex-ternal iliac artery. The stenosis was about 3 cm long， and the distal end was approximately 10 cm away from the bladder insertion port. The ureteral stricture was completely resected\n\n【33】， and the surrounding adhesion tissue was separat-ed and removed . Frozen section was performed for pathological examination， and endometriosis was considered. The 2 ends of the ureterectomy site were fur-ther dissociated and anastomosed. During the operation， no endometriosis was found in the pelvic cavity. After the opera-tion， an F-5 D-J tube was indwelled in the right ureter under the\n\n【34】Adult Abdomen Probe：C251\n\n【35】Bai Y. et al：\n\n【36】EDICAL SYSTEMS SPP\n\n【37】VERY MR750w 3T GEHCGEHC\n\n【38】Se：500\n\n【39】877/MR177726\n\n【40】M：1\n\n【41】COOIL O Cor P 26.5DFOV40.0cm\n\n【42】16 bpm\n\n【43】tlg 20%\n\n【44】ET：80\n\n【45】RAS\n\n【46】M3D/FRFSE-XL/90\n\n【47】TR：3760\n\n【48】TE：1000.4/Ef\n\n【49】EC：1/183.3kHz\n\n【50】Body 36 AA1\n\n【51】FOV：40x40\n\n【52】2.4thk/-1.2ov\n\n【53】352X256/\n\n【54】WW：4492WL：2246\n\n【55】256/1.00 NNEEXL\n\n【56】StAPF/ED/Acc/RT：/Z512/Z2/T2P AA\n\n【57】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

Further postoperative paraffin examina-tion showed the following： partial ureteral wall tissue with mild focal uroepithelial hyperplasia and localized submucosal and in-termuscular ectopic endometrial glands and mesenchyme， con-sistent with endometriosis in the right middle ureter； a small amount of smooth muscle， fibrofatty tissue with focal ectopic endometrial glands and mesenchyme， focal hemorrhage，inflam-matory cell infiltration， and ferritin deposits， consistent with en-dometriosis in the right periureteral anatomy .\n\n【60】Six additional doses of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist(GnRH-a) were administered immediately after surgery， followed by intrauterine placement of the levonorgestrel intrauterine re-lease system (LNG-IUS). Immediately after surgery， the patient was generally well. The patient presented to the outpatient urology clinic 3 months after surgery to remove the D-Jtube.\n\n【61】Discussion\n\n【62】UE can be divided into exogenous and endogenous types. The former is characterized by obstruction due to the compression\n\n【63】of the surrounding endometrium， whereas the latter is an ec-topic occurrence characterized by progression of endometrial tissue lesions in or at the ureteral wall. Exogenous UE is clin-ically more common and is more likely to cause urinary tract obstruction. In this case， ectopic endometrial glands and stro-ma were found in the submucosal and intramural areas of the right middle ureter upon postoperative pathological examina-tion， and the surrounding tissues and peritoneal adhesions were severe during the operation， suggesting exogenous en-dometriosis. Local infiltration of the ureter occurred and even-tually involved the ureteral tissue， resulting in hydronephrosis.\n\n【64】Symptoms in patients with UE are often atypical. Fernando et al concluded that after laparoscopic surgery for patients with UE in the past 10 years， dysmenorrhea (76.3%) and pel-vic pain (59.6%) were the most common symptoms， and ure-teral obstruction symptoms only accounted for 9.9% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In a retrospective analysis of this case， the patient had dysmenor-rhea but ignored it because it could be tolerated， reminding clinicians that in cases of dysmenorrhea with hydronephro-sis， patients should be alerted to the possibility of urinary tract endometriosis.\n\n【65】Bai Y. et al：\n\n【66】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3.

(E， F) 40x and 100x paraffin section images showing focal endometriosis.</u>\n\n【67】Adequate imaging is necessary for UE. Color Doppler ultraso-nography has lower sensitivity and higher specificity in the diagnosis of endometriosis with deep ureteral infiltration， while contrast-enhanced CT has higher sensitivity and lower specificity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Therefore， the use of ultrasound as a first-line auxiliary examination method， and tomography as a supple-mentary imaging method can improve the diagnostic accu-racy and sensitivity. UE presents as hypointense nodules on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and hyperintense foci on both T1- and T2-weighted sequences 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. For deep pelvic en-dometriosis，MRI results are more accurate than CT for detec-tion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. IVP can clarify the location and degree of obstruction and the renal diagram can show the status of renal function. Cystoscopy with transurethral catheter placement can deter-mine the distal site of the stenosis and further exclude other causes of stenosis. In this patient， various imaging examina-tions failed to detect typical endometriosis lesions， but they helped to identify the site of obstruction and stenosis， the na-ture of the lesions， and showed details of renal function. The final diagnosis should be based on pathological examination.\n\n【68】The treatment methods of UE vary according to the disease and intraoperative conditions. Surgery is recommended for pa-tients with ureteral obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Laparoscopic ureterolysis is recommended for UE without hydronephrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， where-as in patients with severe UE， the first choice of treatment is segmental ureterectomy combined with ureterotomy or ure-terocystomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9-11\\]</u>， and long-term postoperative management is extremely important to reduce the recurrence rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.

The criterion standard of treatment for chronic PJl is two-stage revision arthroplasty consisting of complete hardware removal， thorough irrigation and debridement， placement of an antibiotic spacer， prolonged intravenous antibiotics based on culture sensitivities， and revision total knee ar-throplasty once the infection resolves. The most common organism implicated in chronic PJl is Staphylococcus\n\n【21】dureus.\n\n【22】Case Report： In this report， we have summarized the case of a 75-year-old woman who developed chronic PJl caused by an unusual organism， Streptococcus gordonif， 1 year after a right total knee arthroplasty. S. gordonii is a gram-pos-itive organism that is an oral flora and a colonizer of human teeth. This organism is known to create biofilm on the human teeth， more commonly known as dental plaque. S. gordonii has the ability to travel to extraoral sites and cause infection. It has been found to be a cause of subacute bacterial endocarditis， but it has been rarely described in the literature as a cause of prosthetic joint infection. Treatment of 5. gordonii requires a tai-lored approach.\n\n【23】Conclusions： This case report highlights the clinical presentation， diagnosis， and treatment of chronic prosthetic joint in-fection caused by S. gordonii and identifies a rare cause of PJl that is not well documented in the literature. Streptococcal PJl portends a poorer prognosis， and identification of this organism is crucial for prompt treat-ment and improved outcomes for PJ.\n\n【24】Keywords： Biofilms· Knee Joint · Reoperation · Streptococcus gordonii\n\n【25】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/937271\n\n【26】口22029 1 山可甘3 全国21\n\n【27】Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is defined as an infection of the joint prosthesis and intra-articular soft tissue. It is a devastat-ing complication that affects approximately 1-2% of all total joint replacements 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-4\\]</u>. Diagnosis of Pl is based on clinical appearance of the joint， laboratory markers， and synovial flu-id analysis. Treatment of PJI depends on whether the infection is acute (<6 weeks from index surgery) or chronic (>6 weeks from index surgery). The criterion standard for treatment of chronic PJl is implant removal with thorough irrigation and de-bridement， placement of an antibiotic spacer， prolonged course of culture-specific intravenous antibiotics， and revision total joint arthroplasty once the infection has resolved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Chronic PJI necessitates this form of orthopedic management because the infection cannot be eradicated with antibiotics alone once biofilm has formed on the orthopedic implants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Even with criterion standard treatment， the morbidity and mortality rates of PJI are extremely high， with complications including poor patient-reported outcomes， disability， persistent infection， need for amputation， sepsis， and death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The 1-year mor-tality rate for PJl is approximately 5-10%， with a 5-year mor-tality rate approaching 25% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism impli-cated in prosthetic joint infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In this report， we have summarized the case of a 75-year-old woman who developed chronic PJl caused by an unusual organism， Streptococcus gor-donii， 1 year after a right total knee arthroplasty.

She was evaluated by her orthopedic surgeon as an outpatient， where samples were taken for laboratory testing and a knee as-piration was performed. Laboratory test results revealed eryth-rocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 55 mm/h， C-reactive pro-tein (CRP) of 12.8 mg/dL， and synovial white blood cell (WBC) count of 5000 K/uL， consistent with chronic PJl. Cultures were taken from this knee aspiration， which did reveal growth of S. gordonii， but results of this aspiration were not finalized un-til after the initial surgical procedure. Thus， empiric antibiot-ics were held until intraoperative tissue specimens could be obtained， as the patient was clinically and hemodynamically stable prior to surgery. She denied any history of recent den-tal or other invasive procedures. Of note， the patient did not undergo dental clearance prior to her initial procedure， as this is not routinely recommended unless patients have very poor\n\n【32】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

Hemoglobin A1C was 6.9mmol/mol， consistent with a diagnosis of diabetes.\n\n【35】The patient underwent the first stage of her procedure， which consisted of removal of the right knee total arthroplasty，thor-ough irrigation and debridement， and placement of a stat-ic antibiotic spacer consisting of 2 batches of antibiotic-lad-en cement with 6 g of vancomycin and 4.8 g of tobramycin. She was initially treated for prosthetic joint infec-tion with intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g daily and intravenous vancomycin 1 gm/D5W 200 mL pb every 24 h. This isolate was noted on the liquid broth media， which was aliquoted onto an agar plate and incubated for a minimum of 18-24h. On the second reading of the agar plates， there was growth of the isolate， which was tested with a BioMerieux Vitek GPI card. The Vitek MS (MALDI-ToF) system was used for identifi-cation of the isolate. The Vitek system uses mass spectrom-etry， which is highly sensitive for organism identification. In our patient， the Vitek MS system identified the bacterium S. gordonii from the intraoperative right knee tissue specimens. Five tissue specimens were obtained from the intra-articu-lar synovium during this procedure. Three of the 5 specimens yielded growth of S. gordonii. Blood cultures prior to surgery and after surgery remained negative.\n\n【36】Antibiotics were de-escalated to intravenous ceftriaxone2 g every day according to sensitivities. The organism was\n\n【37】pansensitive. Transthoracic echocardiography did not reveal obvious vegetations seen on any valves. Her postoperative course was complicated by an acute kidney injury， which re-solved within 2 days of fluid hydration， and acute blood loss anemia， with hemoglobin measuring 6.9 g/dL， which resolved after transfusion with 1 unit of packed red blood cells. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 4 with ceftriax-one 2 g daily for a total of 6 weeks duration via a peripheral-ly-inserted central catheter. Based on the growth of S. gordo-nii， the patient was recommended to have a detailed dental exam with a panoramic X-ray and a gastroenterological exam with a colonoscopy upon discharge.\n\n【38】At 8-week follow-up， the patient demonstrated resolution of infection， with repeat inflammatory markers within normal limits 2 weeks after an antibiotic holiday.

Three intraoperative intra-articu-lar synovial tissue samples were sent to Pathology， which did not demonstrate acute inflammation， confirming resolution of infection and the ability to proceed with the revision total knee arthroplasty. The patient was not continued on long-term suppressive antibiotics after this procedure.

It usually in-habits the oral flora and is commonly found in the periapi-cal endodontic lesions of patients with apical periodontitis. In the oral cavity， S. gordonii is known to create biofilm on the teeth， forming dental plaque 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. This organism also has the ability to spread to extraoral sites and cause systemic infec-tions. In our patient’s scenario， it is believed that this organ-ism likely spread hematogenously from the oral cavity to the right knee joint. Why this happened is unclear， as the patient denied recent dental procedures or routine dental cleanings.\n\n【43】One potential explanation is oral trauma from the initial sur-gery， though this is unlikely as her infection developed 1 year after her index total knee arthroplasty and she underwent spi-nal anesthesia with monitored anesthesia care (MAC) during this procedure. Once the organism invaded the knee joint， S. gordonii essentially created dental plaque on the total knee prosthesis， forming biofilm on the metallic implant， which pro-tects the organism from host immunity. This resulted in the de-velopment of a chronic PJI， which required the criterion stan-dard treatment for resolution of infection.\n\n【44】Prosthetic joint injection risk factors commonly include intra-venous drug abuse， rheumatologic disorders， alcoholism， pre-vious intra-articular corticosteroid injection， and diabetes mel-litus. Our patient was diabetic， which may have predisposed her to the risk of prosthetic joint infection.

Our case is unique because no recent dental work or dental infection was identified in our patient.\n\n【51】The case report by Yombi et al discussed 2 patients with PJI due to S. gordonii. One patient had a markedly poor dental status and severe pre-existing degenerative arthritis.

She was initially treated with intra-venous ceftriaxone， and then switched to oral levofloxacin for a total of 4 weeks. She initially showed improvement upon discharge， but after a little more than 1 week she reported\n\n【53】increased swelling and pain.

Diagnosis and treat-ment of PJI requires a multidisciplinary approach with coop eration among orthopedics， medicine， and infectious disease departments. Our patient presented with chronic prosthetic joint infection caused by the unusual pathogen S. gordonii. This organism is a normal member of the oral flora and is known to create biofilm on the teeth， more commonly known as den-tal plaque. Although our patient denied any recent dental pro-cedures or routine dental cleaning， S. gordonii likely spread from the oral cavity to the knee joint and formed biofilm on the prosthetic implant. Biofilm formation on the prosthesis protects the organism from host immunity， thus resulting in chronic PJI. She was treated according to the criterion standard protocol for chronic PJl. The patient had full clinical recovery after treatment. It is particularly interesting that the patient did not have recent dental work， as previous reports have de-scribed. This case report highlights a rare case of PJI caused by S. gordonii， which is not well documented in the literature.\n\n【70】Declaration of Figures’Authenticity\n\n【71】All figures submitted have been created by the authors who confirm that the images are original with no duplication and have not been previously published in whole or in part.\n\n【72】12\\.

Skin toxicities are recognized adverse effects of the new DOACs， but are rare and usually associated with vas-culitis. This report is of a 78-year-old man admitted to the hospital with pulmonary thromboembolism， who developed severe and extensive skin necrosis of both forearms 7 days after treatment with apixaban.\n\n【19】Case Report：\n\n【20】A 78-year-old man was admitted for pulmonary embolism and congestive heart failure exacerbation. He was started on therapeutic enoxaparin and diuresis. Later on， enoxaparin was substituted with apixaban. Seven days after starting apixaban， he suddenly developed skin changes that developed into skin necrosis on both forearms and the abdominal wall. A skin biopsy was not performed due to the high risk of bleeding. Skin ne-crosis was diagnosed based on clinical findings. A review of clinical data and the patient's medication profile did not reveal any other possible etiology or culprit medication. Clinical presentation and lab values were not consistent with infections or autoimmune etiologies. Apixaban was discontinued as it was perceived to be the likely cause of skin necrosis. The skin changes gradually improved within 1 week with supportive wound care， and the patient did not require a skin graft. The patient was discharged safely with subcutaneous low-molec-ular-weight heparin therapy\n\n【21】Conclusions：\n\n【22】This report shows that skin toxicity can be associated with apixaban and that with the increasing use of these newer DOACs， clinicians should be aware of these potential adverse effects.\n\n【23】MeSH Keywords： Anticoagulants· Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions · Skin Abnormalities\n\n【24】Abbreviations：\n\n【25】DOACs - direct oral anticoagulants； COPD-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease； CAD -coronary ar-tery disease； CABG- coronary artery bypass graft； CKD - chronic kidney disease； ProBNP - pro brain na-triuretic peptide； V/Q scan -ventilation-perfusion scan； AISN -apixaban-induced skin necrosis\n\n【26】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/929002\n\n【27】品目日\n\n【28】\\]\n\n【29】1127 非12\n\n【30】In late 2010， a new class of anticoagulants known as direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) was introduced as an alternative to conventional anticoagulation therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

Although skin toxicities are recognized adverse effects of the new DOACs， including apixaban， they are rare and are usually associated with vasculitis. This report is of a 78-year-old man admitted to the hospital with pulmonary thromboembolism， who developed severe and extensive skin necrosis of both forearms 7 days after treatment with apixaban.\n\n【32】Case Report\n\n【33】A 78-year-old man with a history of hypertension， chronic ob-structive pulmonary disease (COPD)， coronary artery disease(CAD)， coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)， diastolic heart fail-ure， and stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD) presented with worsening dyspnea， swelling of the left leg， and pain for the last 2 days. On physical examination， he had bilateral basilar crackles with expiratory wheezing and bilateral lower-extrem-ity edema. Troponin was 0.02 ng/ml， pro brain natriuretic pep-tide (ProBNP) was 1140 pg/ml， and D-dimer was elevated to1066 ng/m. FEU. A chest X-ray showed right basilar lung infil-trate. Initially， he was started on bronchodilators for his COPD， diuresis for his congestive heart failure (CHF)， and intravenous antibiotics for possible pneumonia. Pulmonary embolism was also considered in the differential diagnosis due to his in-creased oxygen requirement. CT angiography of the chest was not performed due to his elevated creatinine. A ventilation-perfusion lung scan (V/Q scan) showed an intermediate prob-ability of pulmonary embolism. Ultrasound Doppler imaging of the lower extremities did not show deep vein thrombosis. The combination of the patient’s acute clinical presentation， elevated D-dimer， and V/Q scan intermediate probability was suggestive of pulmonary embolism. Therapeutic subcutaneous\n\n【34】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1. The left forearm shows a confluent and extensive area of skin necrosis with no raised skin lesions， no vesicles， and no purulent exudate.</u>\n\n【35】enoxaparin was initiated based on the creatinine clearance， as recommended by the pharmacy.\n\n【36】During the hospital stay， his condition was stabilized with bronchodilators and systemic glucocorticoids for advanced COPD， piperacillin/tazobactam for pneumonia， and diuresis for chronic diastolic congestive heart failure. His respiration was supported with a continued nasal cannula and BiPAP as needed. After 2 days of enoxaparin， he was switched to oral apixaban for his pulmonary embolism. His shortness of breath was improving slowly due to his underlying advanced COPD and CHF. During this time， he was waiting for a skilled nurs-ing home placement.\n\n【37】After the seventh day of initiating apixaban， he developed a painful small ecchymosis on the left forearm， which quickly pro-gressed to skin necrosis across the left forearm within 2 days. He also developed skin necrosis on the right arm and the abdominal wall area. Surgery and Dermatology servic-es were consulted. A skin biopsy was not performed due to the high risk of bleeding. The clinical presentation was not consis-tent with any autoimmune process. Apixaban was discontin-ued immediately. After reviewing all the patient's medications during that interval， the clinical conclusion was a diagnosis of apixaban-induced skin necrosis. The skin changes gradually improved within 7 days with wound care and dressing. The\n\n【38】patient did not require skin grafting， and he was discharged with therapeutic subcutaneous enoxaparin. Two weeks after discharge， he was readmitted for anemia， at which time his skin lesion had improved significantly.\n\n【39】Discussion\n\n【40】Apixaban is reported to cause non-hemorrhagic adverse ef-fects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-9\\]</u>. In leukocytoclastic vasculitis cases， lower-extremity skin purpura developed after 9 days of apixaban therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. It was managed with systemic steroid with complete resolu-tion of skin changes within a few weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. In one case， the patient was successfully switched to rivaroxaban without any adverse events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Veliyev et al. described a case of palmoplan-tar psoriasiform drug eruption in which cutaneous drug erup-tion developed after 3 days of apixaban therapy； it was man-aged with topical steroids， and skin changes resolved entirely within a few weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Patil et al. reported a case of apixa-ban-induced delayed drug reaction-lichenoid reaction in which the patient was managed with topical steroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Similar to apixaban， rivaroxaban， another DOAC， has also been report-ed to cause skin toxicity. Soliman et al. reported a case of ri-varoxaban-induced skin necrosis in which skin changes devel-oped after 3 days of therapy； it was managed with a topical steroid， and the patient was successfully switched to low-mo-lecular-weight heparin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【41】The pathophysiology behind DOAC-induced skin toxicity is un-clear. Possible mechanisms include microvascular thrombo-sis， an imbalance between anticoagulant and procoagulant factors， autoimmune response， and direct medication toxici-ty 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The pathophysiology of warfarin-induced skin necro-sis is well explained. Warfarininactivates vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors ll， II， IX， and X. However， it also inacti-vates the vitamin K-dependent anticoagulants protein C and S. This may generate an imbalance between pro-coagulation and anticoagulation， which can lead to microvascular throm-bi and skin necrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，12\\]</u>. It is unknown at this time if war-farin-induced skin necrosis and DOAC-induced skin toxicity share a similar pathophysiology.\n\n【42】There are some limitations to this case report. An autoim-mune workup for drug-induced vasculitis was not performed. Protein C and Protein S levels could not be obtained because of inpatient restrictions as per hospital policy. A skin biopsy was not performed as the patient was on aspirin and Plavix as a home medication due to his significant coronary artery disease， and he was at high risk for bleeding and post-biop-sy skin infections.\n\n【43】Our experience and literature review suggest that treatment of this condition with prompt discontinuation of the offend-ing DOAC and conservative management with wound care is sufficient to manage the skin necrosis.\n\n【44】Conclusions\n\n【45】Although skin toxicities are recognized adverse effects of the new DOACs， including apixaban， they are rare and are usually associated with vasculitis. To the best of our knowledge， apix-aban-induced skin necrosis has not been reported. This report has shown that skin toxicity can be associated with apixaban and that with the increasing use of these newer DOACs， cli-nicians should be aware of these potential adverse effects. In this case， the mainstay of treatment was the discontinuation of the causative agent and supportive treatment.\n\n【46】Disclaimer\n\n【47】This whole case report was supported by HCA Health Care-Kingwood Medical Center.

Leprosy was officially eliminated from India (<1 case per 10000 population) in 2005， but we are still getting new cases of Leprosy in our setting. We have undertaken the study to find out the clinical profile and magnitude of Leprosy patients attending the tertiary care level centre of Assam and to analyse any factor behind the increasing trend of incidence. Method and Material： A hospital-based retrospective clinical study was carried out on patients diagnosed and registered in the tertiary care centre of Assam from 1st September 2011 to 31st August 2016. The data was analysed according to predefined parameters. Result： A total of 100 patients were registered over a period of 5years with a male to female ratio of 3：1. The majority of patients were in the middle age group (31-45 years). Lepromatous leprosy was the most frequent morphological type. The clinicopathological correlation was observed in 60% of patients. AFB in the tissue section was found in 2 cases. Various deformities of the hands， feet， or eyes were seen in 37 patients. Lepra reaction was observed in 24% of the patients. Follow up cases responded well to Multidrug therapy. Conclusion：It shows that despite statistical elimination of Leprosy from India， there are still some areas having a high incidence of multibacillary disease. Reaction and Deformities are other burdens. It highlights the need for intensification of early case detection and control.\n\n【4】KEYWORDS Leprosy， Deformities， Reactions， Treatment\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium Leprae.

Cases were detected and diagnosed as per the definition laid out by the 8th meeting of the WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy in2010 after taking the due clearance from the ethical committee.\n\n【17】Slit skin smears from patches and ear lobules were done in every patient. In addition， histopathological examination and\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1： Year wise distribution.</u>\n\n【19】AFB staining in tissue section was done in patients were needed for confirmation of diagnosis and as supplementation to classifi-cation. The patients were classified according to Ridley- Jopling classification通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>， Indian classification通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> and WHO classification(PB and MB)； and were treated accordingly. For disability clas-sification， WHO 3 points 1998 was followed for hand， foot and eyes. The clinical data was subsequently organised， tabulated and statistically analysed.\n\n【20】Results\n\n【21】A total number of 100 patients were registered over a period of 5 years from 1st September 2011 to 31st August 2016， with a male to female ratio of 3：1. Most patients were in the middle age group 通用删除7(英):<u>(31-45)</u>， followed by 16-30 years 通用删除8(英):<u>\\[Table 1\\]</u>.Leprosy in Children aged ≤14 years was seen in 4 cases. The minimum age was 12 years， and the maximum age was 72 years. The mean age of the patients was 37.96 years. Only 6 patients had a history of household contact. The majority of patients were from a lower socioeconomic class. Multibacillary leprosy was the most com-mon clinical type (86%). The most frequent morphological type was Lepromatous leprosy， followed by Borderline tuberculoid通用删除8(英):<u>\\[fig 2\\]</u>. Pure neuritic and Histoid were also encountered in this study. Biopsy was done in 50 cases (50%). A clinicopathologi-cal correlation was observed in 30 cases (60%) \\[Table 2. AFB in the tissue section was found in 2 cases. BT was the most common histopathological diagnosis. Type 2 Reaction was seen in 16 patients (66%) and type 1 reaction in 8 patients (33%). A total of 10 patients were seen to be in reaction at initial presenta-tion； others (14 patients) developed it after initiation of therapy. Type 2 reactions were observed among lepromatous patients(LL and BL) while type 1 reactions in BT. Neuritis was observed in 12 patients， of whom 7 had T1R， and 5 had T2R. The ulnar nerve was the most commonly affected. Out of 100 patients， the deformity was observed， in 37 patients. The trophic ulcer was most common in 15， followed by Claw hand in 10 and foot drop in 8 patients 通用删除8(英):<u>\\[Table 3 and fig 3\\]</u>. Deformity rate is more in multi-bacillary leprosy patients than paucibacillary patients. The proportion of cases with deformities (both grade I and gradeⅡ) is more in males than in females.\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】Leprosy is a chronic granulomatous disease， can lead to pro-gressive damages to various organs if left untreated. However， leprosy is a curable disease， and disability can be averted by early diagnosis and treatment通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【24】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2： Clinical spectrum of Leprosy.</u>\n\n【25】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3： Types of deformities</u>\n\n【26】Table 1： Demographic profile of leprosy patients.\n\n| Age groups  | male  | female  | Numbers of cases(%)  | Contacthistory  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0-15 years  | 3  | 1  | 4  | 2  |\n| 16-30 years  | 23  | 5  | 28  | 3  |\n| 31-45 years  | 31  | 8  | 39  | 1  |\n| 46-60 years  | 12  | 7  | 19  | 0  |\n| Above 60 years  | 6  | 4  | 10  | 0  |\n| Total  | 75  | 25  | 100  | 6  |\n\n【28】Table 2： Histopathological co-relation with the disease.\n\n| Clinical diagnosis  | No of casesbiopsy performed  |  |  | HPE finding  |  |  |  |  | AFB in tissuesection  | Concordance with clinical diagnosis (%)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Clinical diagnosis  | No of casesbiopsy performed  | TT  | BT  | BB  | BL  | LL  | Histoid  | Non-specific  | AFB in tissuesection  | Concordance with clinical diagnosis (%)  |\n| TT  | 2  | 1  | 1  |  | 一  | 一  |  | 一  | 一  | 50%  |\n| BT  | 23  | 2  | 16  | 一  | 4  |  | 一  | 1  | 一  | 69.56%  |\n| BL  | 7  | 一  | 1  | 一  | 2  | 3  | 一  | 1  | 一  | 28.57%  |\n| LL  | 16  | 一  | 一  | 一  | 6  | 10  | 一  | 一  | 1  | 62.5%  |\n| Histoid  | 2  | 一  | 一  | 一  | 一  | 1  | 1  | 一  | 1  | 50%  |\n|  | T=50  |  |  | T=30  |  |  |  |  | T=2  |  |\n\n【30】Table 3： Prevalence of deformities in hands， feet and eyes.\n\n| Deformities (n=37，M：F=25：12)  |  | Numbers of cases  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hands  | grade 1 grade 2  | 35 18  |\n| Feet  | grade 1 grade 2  | 24 23  |\n| Eyes  | Lagophthalmos Corneal ulcer  | 3 2  |\n\n【32】Table 4： Clinico-pathological examination of the cases.\n\n| Number ofcases  | BI  | Number of cases  | MI  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 60  | 0  | 60  | 0  | 0  |\n| 8  | 1+  | 15  | <15%  | 0  |\n| 2  | 2+  | 12  | 16-30%  | 0  |\n| 7  | 3+  | 10  | 31-45%  | 0  |\n| 9  | 4+  | 9  | 46-60%  | 0  |\n| 4  | 5+  | 8  | 61-75%  | 0  |\n| 10  | 6+  | 3  | \\>75%  | 9-12%  |\n\n【34】Table 5： Management of grade 2 deformities in our study\n\n| 1.Active wound/ulcer  | Wound care and dressing  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 2\\. thick calluses and tropiculcer  | Pairing of calluses and POP application for ulcer healing  |\n| 3.flexon deformities  | For mobile deformities- physiotherapyFor fixed deformities- referred for corrective surgery  |\n| 4\\. others  | Referred to Ophthalmology and ENT Department accordingly.  |\n\n【36】The goal of eliminating leprosy as a public health prob-lem was reached at the global level in 20003. This was fol-lowed by the \"Strategic plan for Leprosy Elimination'2000-2005'， through which India achieved elimination on 31st December2005.“Global Strategy for Further Reducing the Leprosy Bur-den and Sustaining Leprosy Control Activities 2006-2010\"was pioneered with the main intention of ensuring program sus-tainability by reducing reliance on vertical infrastructure and promoting integration within the General Health Care System(GHS)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The“Enhanced global strategy for further reducing the disease burden due to Leprosy 2011-2015also focuses on sustaining the gains made so for 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，11\\]</u>.\n\n【37】Our study shows an increasing trend of annual case detection rate 通用删除8(英):<u>\\[fig 1\\]</u>. There was slight lower case detection in 2014， but as a whole， there is an increasing trend. This lower incidence in2014 could be accredited to the ethnic clashes which occurred in this area resulting in overall minimal attendance of patients in the hospital. In our study majority of the patients belonged to the middle age group (31-40yrs)，similar to the finding reported by Jindal et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>； Arora et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> A higher male to female(3：1) ratio in this study could be due to increased exposure in males as males are more outdoor workers in comparison to females and also a lower percentage of females taking health care facilities； so the possibility of more unreported cases is there. Similar reports were observed in most of the studies by Dambalkar K et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> and Bhattacharya SN et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> We have observed a significantly higher rate (86%) of MB cases than PB cases which is similar to the finding reported by N Chhabra et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. The high rate of MB cases could be a sign of hidden pockets of the population， which are the source of new infections. Positive family or contact history was observed in 6% which is similar to the study conducted by N Chhabra et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>； but lower than that reported by Jindal et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Percentage of children affected in our study is 4% which is quite low comparative to study done by Singhal A et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. In comparison to increased number of MB cases， we have observed family history only in6% and a lower percentage cases in children (4%). These MB(esp lepromatous leprosy) cases serve as a potential source of disease harbouring many bacilli. They might have transmitted the disease to others (esp household contact including children) long before their disease becomes clinically detectable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. So the possibility of more undiagnosed cases could not be ruled out. It may be the reason behind the increasing number of cases. Clinico-pathological co-relation was found in 60% of cases in our study， which is similar to the study reported by Kumar et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In this study， out of 100 patients， 37 patients (M：F=25：12) suffered from various deformities of the hands， feet， or eyes， which is similar to the study by N Chhabra et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>(37.9%) and Singhi MK et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> (35%) but， much higher than other studies conducted by Jain et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>(9.5%)； Jindal et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>(17%)； Asia AJ et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u> (24%). The male preponderance in disability incidence has also been reported in a study conducted by Arora M et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. High deformity incidence in our study may be due to the fact that the patients attend health care facilities late when much damage has already occurred. It highlights the active search of cases instead of voluntary reporting； early initiation of treatment for disease and leprosy reaction if present. Lepra reaction was found in 24(24%) patients. Types of reactions correlate with their disease spectrum. The percentage of T1R was low， and most of the T1R was seen in BT (60%)， which is similar to the studies done by Tiwari PK 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u> and Singh AL et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Type 2 reaction was seen in 16% of patients， similar to that\n\n【38】reported by Jindal et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>(17.2%). Most of T2R was seen in LL(56.25%).\n\n【39】Management\n\n【40】Patients were given MB and PB treatment according to WHO guidelines. 86 (86%) of patients received MB MDT treatment， while 14 (14%) of patients were treated with PB MDT. In the PB group of patients， there was clinically marked regression of lesions and/or sensory improvement. The smear-positive pa-tients treated with MB MDT were considered for morphological index (MI) 通用删除8(英):<u>\\[Table 4\\]</u>. 80% of patients had granular or fragmented bacilli after 6 months course of MDT. Eight (8%) patients were defaulters. Relapse after treatment was not found during that period. Management of deformities was done according to the grade of deformities. Grade 1 deformities of the hand and feet were managed by giving proper education and demonstration for taking care of anaesthetic parts. Grade 2 deformities were managed accordingly \\[table 5\\].\n\n【41】Conclusion\n\n【42】It has been observed that despite the statistical elimination， there is a high incidence of multibacillary disease. The increased proportion of multibacillary cases is alarming as they represent a major source of infection. Reaction and deformity are other burdens. Social stigma； poor awareness about the disease avoids diagnosis and treatment， allowing a completely curable disease to worsen to the point of deformities. It highlights the need for intensification of the awareness programme， early case detection and control.\n\n【43】Funding\n\n【44】This work did not receive any grant from funding agencies in the public， commercial， or not-for-profit sectors.\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of interest</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There are no conflicts of interest to declare by any of the authors of this study.</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>References</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

However， the risk of cardiac events as one of the complications after TJA surgery may be a threatening condition. Many risk factors may affect the possibility of cardiac complications occurring in patients. We critically reviewed the cardiac events after TJA surgery， focused on myocardial infarct， cardiac arrest， and new onset of arrhythmia； we also reviewed its risk factors that may raise the possibilities of those complications present in the patient. Some risk factors have been identified， like age， gender， obesity， comorbid disease， and type of arthroplasty. Risks of cardiovascular events following the surgery are present even though the risk is lower as the recent approaches are improved. Some risk factors like age， gender， history of cardiac disease， hypertension， obesity， diabetes， and type of arthroplasty are significantly correlated with the postoperative cardiac complication. Therefore， comprehensive postoperative follow up is needed to prevent threatening conditions in patients who had undergone TJA surgery.\n\n【7】KEYWORDS Total joint arthroplasty， Total knee arthroplasty， Total hip arthroplasty， Cardiac complications， Myocardial intarction\n\n【8】1\\.

Since 2003， the incidence of TKA procedures in Australia has increased by more than 123%. A recent report in 2017 claimed that 55，000 primary TKA proce-dures had been done通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. This trend of TKA procedure is ex-pected to grow even higher in both Australia and other countries worldwide通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-8\\]</u>.

Moreover， It is also one of the major reasons for a physician to refer a 65-year-old patient or more to the hospital in the USA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. By the end of 2040， the prevalence rate of hip frac-tures 65-year-old-or-more population is approximately raised significantly from 34.8 to 77.2 million. The incidence rate of this fracture may increase to over 500，000 in one year通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Consistent with the disease prevalence and incidence， both Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) and TKA events are expected to grow higher approximately 174% and 673% in 2030， respectively， with an estimated 4 million of Total Joint Arthroplasty (TJA) are performed yearly in USA通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13-15\\]</u>.\n\n【20】There are over one million people worldwide who undergo THA for osteoarthritis annually通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Unfortunately， when com-pared with other joint replacement surgery， this procedure is linked with high long-term inflammatory foreign-body tissue reaction incidence通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17，18\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Studies reported that major cardiac complication after TJA is as low as 0.2 to 0.8% and are considered a relatively safe proce-dure with the precaution of the significantly increased risk if the substantial increase of projected arthroplasties is considered通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19-23\\]</u>. However， cardiac complication， as the major mortality and\n\n【22】morbidity caused after TJA procedure， plays a role in the higher rate of hospital mortality， noncardiac events， length of stay， and health expenditure通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19，24-27\\]</u>.Thus， there has been an important need to understand the contributing risks for THA-and-TKA-associated cardiac complications通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>.\n\n【23】A study reported that early mortality after primary THA pro-cedure in the 90-days range is at 17 of 1727 (1%) cases. Approx-imately 0.2% of the index was in patients under 70-years-old，1.3% in patients between 70-80 years old， and 2.5% in patients over 80-years-old. Some other causes for the mortality in this study were due to ischemic heart disease (n=7)， cerebrovascular disorders (n=4)，pulmonary embolism (n=2)， and nonvascular etiologies (n=4)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. Ischemic heart disease is considered the most common cause of vascular death\\[30J.\n\n【24】This review aims to describe the possibilities of acute cardiac complications in patients who have undergone total joint arthro-plasty surgery. To achieve this， the authors describe cardiac events reported after total joint arthroplasty and describe risk factors affecting the cardiac event after the procedure.\n\n【25】2\\. Cardiac Events/Complications after Total Joint Arthroplasty Myocardial Infarction\n\n【26】Myocardial infarction (MI) is considered the most common car-diac adverse event after TJA surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30-32\\]</u>. However， many surgeons have confidence in low MI risk and decide on early patient discharge due to improved surgical and anaesthetic ap-proaches recently despite some simultaneous changes opposing this theory. Furthermore， there has been a significant survival rate of patients with high-risk coronary artery disease (CAD). However， at the same time， the number of patients that need surgery， like severe knee and hip osteoarthritis， is also increased. Therefore， the tendency for the lower length of stay is very ap-pealing for both hospitals and patients. However， old patients with present comorbidities should be given more caution. The study reported that a 3-day delay in discharge following TJA surgery might identify cardiac attacks in 83% of the subjects通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. The incidence and mortality outcomes of postoperative cardiac arrest episodes have become a concern for improving surgical patient outcomes. A study reported that three-quarters of 200surgical patients had a postoperative cardiac arrest complication before or on the day of the surgery， and two-thirds of them died in the first 30 days postoperatively通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. In addition， Pulido et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u> and Basilico et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u> have reported cardiac complications， including cardiac arrest and arrhythmia， as one of the major systemic adverse effects following total joint arthroplasty (TJA)， such as Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) or Total Hip Arthroplasty(THA).\n\n【27】Other studies conclude that myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest is the second-highest systemic complication post total joint arthroplasty\\[13，191. Another study by Taheriazam et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u> reports episodes of cardiac arrest in a 78-years-old patient who underwent a cemented arthroplasty. A better understanding of this complication is needed to improve careful observation in the intensive care room postoperatively. Most patients with total joint arthroplasty experienced the cardiac arrest episode within the first 3 days postoperatively\\[13，19J.\n\n【28】The study concluded that patients with a total joint arthro-plasty should be observed for at least 3 days following the pro-cedure in the hospital. Waterman et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u> report an increase of postoperative cardiac arrest episodes in patients with age ≥80years， history of hypertension， and history of cardiac diseases.(p<0.005). The study reports an increased odds of cardiac arrest\n\n【29】episode by twofold for a history of hypertension and fourfold for age ≥ 80 years. Basilico et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u> also report similar findings that the history of cardiac diseases shows an increase of cardiac complications postoperatively. Another study by Shah et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> demonstrates a significantly higher rate of cardiac arrest in total joint arthroplasty surgery than joint arthroscopy surgery.\n\n【30】Another common cardiac complication after arthroplasty surgery is arrhythmia. Feng et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> reported arrhythmia as the highest cardiac complication after THA and TKA. Studies by Godoy et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u> and Urban et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u> also reported similar findings. Feng et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> also concluded that the highest rate of arrhythmia occurs when the total joint arthroplasty is performed within 2 years after cardiac revascularization. In addition，long et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u> reported that a history of atrial fibrillation correlated with higher bleeding and cardiac complication rates after total joint arthroplasty.\n\n【31】A higher odd of cardiac complications like arrhythmia or myocardial infarction is shown among patients with diabetes mellitus， absence of Beta Blocker (B-blocker) use， heart rate 一70/min， hypertension， and BMI > 25kg/m2. In addition， a study by Urban et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u> reported higher postoperative cardiac complications on patients with elevated plasma troponin (cTnl) levels. Since increased odds of cardiac complications occurred among patients with a history of cardiac diseases and their risk factors， the postoperative condition should be given more care and attention.\n\n【32】3\\. Risk Factors of Cardiac Complication after Total Joint Arthroplasty\n\n【33】Total joint arthroplasty， including THA and TKA， is a com-mon surgical procedure in the orthopaedic field involving high peri-operative risk related to the patient's age and multiple as-sociated diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. Some potential complications are known to occur during or following this procedure. Among all adverse outcomes， cardiovascular complications represent the princi-pal cause of death通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Major cardiovascular complications as-sociated with THA and TKA can be classified as myocardial infarction， cardiac arrest， thromboembolism， deep vein throm-bosis， and pulmonary embolism通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. Gill et al. reported that the death rate from cardiovascular complications is 0.2-0.29%. Age and history of cardiac disease were identified as two major risk factors in cardiac fatality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. Another study documented an incidence of cardiovascular complications ranging from 0.3-0.9%after total joint replacement surgery， and 30-day cardiac-related mortality was 0.35% for THA and 0.18% for TKA通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24，37\\]</u>. Among those patients with cardiac complications， 20.6% had increased plasma troponin I (cTnI) levels， which are more likely to have severe cardiac events. This serum is a specific marker and has a higher sensitivity to detect perioperative myocardial ischaemic than creatine phosphokinase (CPK)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30，37\\]</u>.\n\n【34】Factors identified as predictors of perioperative cardiac com-plications included age， gender， history of cardiac disease， obe-sity， hypertension， diabetes mellitus， type of arthroplasty，and chronic lung disease. Other conditions such as renal comorbidi-ties， malnutrition， anaemia， alcohol use，cerebrovascular disease， higher ASA-class， and smoking have also been reported as the potential risk factors of cardiac complications， although known to a lesser extent. Recognizing these cardiac risk factors may improve awareness in preoperative plans and postoperative ob-servations and thus reduce the incidence of cardiac events after surgery.\n\n【35】a. Age Advanced age has been identified as a traditional risk factor for cardiac complications. A study conducted by Wa-terman et al. reported that age more than 80 is a significant predictor of cardiac events after TKA and THA通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24，28\\]</u>. A previous study by Mantilla et al. documented the higher frequency of myocardial infarction in patients aged more than 70 years. The risk of cardiac events was four to nine times higher for patients over 70 years than patients less than 45 years 30\\].\n\n【36】b. Gender Menendez et al. reported that the male gender had1.4 times higher odds of being diagnosed with myocardial infarction after TJA than the female gender通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Another study by Robinson et al. documented that the incidence of MI after THA and TKA in male patients was relatively high， 0.16% and 0.33%， respectively. The increased chances of MI in male patients could be partially due to the host’s previous conditions. On the contrary， the female gender was the protective factor for cardiac events in THA and TKA28\\].\n\n【37】c. History of cardiac disease A history of cardiac diseases such as arrhythmia， coronary artery disease， myocardial infarct， congestive heart failure， or valvular disease was correlated with a higher risk of perioperative cardiovascular compli-cations. Most studies have shown that the patients with previous cardiac disease were at a 1.5 times higher risk of suffering cardiac events following TKA and THA通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. A patient with a history of cardiac diseases added by several conditions such as ASA class II and IV will significantly increase the cardiac event’s risk by 4.4 times. The previ-ous thromboembolic disease also increases the risk by 3.2times 30\\].\n\n【38】d. Obesity Obesity is abnormal or excessive body fat accumu-lation presented as a body mass index (BMI) score over30. The study conducted by Feng et al. concluded that obese patients showed a tendency of increased cardiac com-plication risks after surgery compared to normal-weight patients通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. However， other studies by Anoushiravani et al. and Thornqvist et al.； reported a possible association between underweight patients and cardiac complications after total joint replacement. Thus，patients who are under-weight and obese may therefore be at the same risk of car-diac complications. Fu et al. also reported similar findings that malnutrition has a higher risk of cardiac complication after THA and TKA\\[28J.\n\n【39】e. Hypertension A study by Belmont Jr. et al. identified that hypertension requiring medication was one of the most significant predictors for the development of postoperative cardiac events通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. This finding is also in line with the study by Waterman et al.， which reported that a history of hypertension increased the odds of myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest by a factor of two通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Dy et al. also documented similar findings that hypertension increased the risk of cardiac complications by 1.56 times after THA and TKA surgery通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>.\n\n【40】f. Diabetes A study by Martinez-Huedo et al. reported an increase of total joint arthroplasty (TJA) among Type 2 Di-abetes Mellitus (T2DM) patient通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u>. This correlates with an increase in the number of T2DM patients and arthritis； therefore， the number of T2DM patients that underwent\n\n【41】TJA is likely to increase. In a study by Belmont Jr. et al.， dia-betes was correlated with increased cardiac complications in T2DM patients who undergo a TJA operation通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Both complicated and uncomplicated diabetes showed a relation between the incidence of diabetes and an increased risk of cardiac complications通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. This finding is consistent with several previous studies通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，40，41\\]</u>. Dy et al. revealed an increase of the cardiac complications following TKA and THA in patients with T2DM by 1.55 times 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. Despite sim-ilar findings from other studies， Bolognesi et al. report a lower frequency of myocardial infarction among the T2DM patients that undergo a TJA operation通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42\\]</u>.\n\n【42】g. Type of arthroplasty Based on the study by Shah et al.， TKA and THA had a 1.94 to 2.5 times greater risk of cardiac events than a lesser invasive procedure， including knee arthroscopy通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Another study by Menendez et al. re-ported that primary THA was associated with a higher risk of AMI than primary TKA通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Martin et al. found that bilateral metal-on-metal (MoM) THA may result in cardiac failure due to cobalt toxicity. In addition， the elevated cobalt levels may present severe systemic side effects， including cardiomyopathy， polycythaemia， hypothyroidism， and neu-ropathy complications通用删除6(英):<u>\\[43\\]</u>.\n\n【43】h. Others Many other conditions are related to cardiac com-plications following joint replacement surgery. Feng et al. investigated that simultaneous bilateral TJA surgery has a higher risk of cardiac events than unilateral TJA surgery. This higher risk of cardiac events is assumed due to the extensive invasive procedure and longer operation time通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Patient with previous acute renal failure was also associated with increased cardiac complications following TKA and THA通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Other prevalent comorbid conditions， including cerebrovascular and chronic pulmonary diseases， were dis-covered as significant risk factors for cardiac complications after TJA surgery13. Previous cerebrovascular disease and chronic pulmonary disease associated with AMI were re-ported with an odds ratio of 2.3 and 0.8， respectively通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Shah et al. identified smoking as a significant risk factor associated with cardiac complications after TJA surgery通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Corticosteroid use for patients who underwent TKA and THA has also been reported to increase perioperative com-plications， including cardiac complications通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44\\]</u>.\n\n【44】4\\. Conclusion\n\n【45】TJA surgery becomes more often as the prevalence and incidence of osteoarthritis are increased. The risk of cardiovascular events following the surgery like myocardial infarct， cardiac arrest， and new onset of arrhythmia is present even though some surgeons believe that the risk is getting lower as the recent surgery ap-proaches are improved. Some factors are the significant cause of the cardiac event presented after TJA surgery， like age， gender， history of cardiac disease， hypertension， obesity， diabetes， and type of arthroplasty done in the patient. Present renal， cere-brovascular， and chronic pulmonary disease also play a role in presenting the cardiac events after TJA surgery.\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Declarations</u>\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethics approval and consent to participate</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All consents have been taken.</u>\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Consent for publication</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Informed consent has been taken.</u>\n\n【51】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Competing interests</u>\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author's contribution</u>\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Panji Sananta： Conceptualization， Data curation， Methodology， Formal analysis， Interpretation， S ySiS，Iupervision， Validation， Writing- original draft， Writing -review & editing.

He subsequently developed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-positive acute pleural empyema in an evacuated right-sided pneumothorax. Surgical thoracoscopic curettage was ultimately performed， but dyspnea recurred post-operatively. Computed tomography depicted widespread reticular shadowing of the left lung， and peripheral eosinophilia was detected. The proportion of eosinophils found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was also re-markable (43%). All symptoms and the results of laboratory tests immediately improved after the discontinu-ation of vancomycin and initiation of prednisolone therapy\n\n【20】Conclusions：\n\n【21】We attribute this case of eosinophilic pneumonia to vancomycin， because all other candidate causes were ruled out， and only vancomycin fulfilled the criteria of both drug-induced eosinophilic pneumonia and drug-induced lung injury. If confirmed， this constitutes the first reported case of vancomycin-induced eosinophilic pneumonia.\n\n【22】MeSH Keywords： Hemodialysis· Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus·Pulmonary Eosinophilia· Vancomycin\n\n【23】Full-text PDF： https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/917647\n\n【24】Background\n\n【25】Vancomycin (VCM) is a glycopeptide antibiotic used to treat staphylococcal infections， particularly those involving methicil-lin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Previously re ported lung conditions associated with VCM include drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome， anaphylaxis， and red man syndrome， among others 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Herein， we describe what is， to the best of our knowledge， the first reported case of VCM-induced eosinophilic pneumonia (EP).\n\n【26】Case Report\n\n【27】A 65-year-old man undergoing maintenance hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease was admitted to the hospital with chest pain and dyspnea. His medical history included IgA ne-phropathy (hemodialysis was started for chronic renal failure at the age of 58 years)， angina pectoris (at the age of 59 years， with coronary artery bypass surgery performed 6 years prior)， pneumothorax (once on the right side and once on the left， both at the age of 60 years)， and cholesteatoma in the right ear (at the age of 42 years). He smoked approximately 30 ciga-rettes a day from age 20 to 36 years and had no history of al-lergies or immune disease. His medication regimen included aspirin， mosapride citrate hydrate， precipitated calcium car-bonate， ferric citrate hydrate， lanthanum carbonate hydrate， carvedilol， olmesartan medoxomil， amlodipine besilate， alfa-calcidol， and esomeprazole magnesium hydrate.\n\n【28】Chest X-ray imaging and computed tomography (CT) revealed a right-sided pneumothorax  prompting imme-diate thoracic drainage. On day 7 of hospitalization， intermit-tent fever commenced， and the drainage fluid became turbid on day 9. On day 9， laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 11 800/uL (normal range3300-8600/uL)， neutrophil count of 86.2% (normal range48-61%)， and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP； 15.42 mg/dL， normal levels <0.14 mg/dL) with a normal eosinophil count of 2.3% (normal range 1-5%). On day 10， MRSA was isolat-ed from pleural fluid obtained on day 9. Surgery was per-formed for acute pleural empyema due to MRSA with pneu-mothorax. The patient was then started on intravenous VCM(0.5 g every 2-3 days after dialysis， intravenously) and piper-acillin/tazobactam (PIPC/TAZ； 4.5 g twice daily， intravenously). VCM was targeted at MRSA， and PIPC/TAZ was started as a broad-spectrum antibiotic because the patient was a compro-mised host. Flow cytometry before VCM administration was not performed because immediate antibiotic administration was necessary to treat the MRSA infection， and flow cytome-try tests are limited to the diagnosis of hematological diseas-es (for example， malignant lymphoma) in clinical practice in Japan. On day 12， the patient's eosinophil count rose to 26.0%\n\n【29】and CRP was 25.84 mg/dL Because the sole bacterial isolate was MRSA， PIPC/TAZ was discontinued on day 16. On day 16， the eosinophil count was 27.9%， CRP was 12.18 mg/dL， and the WBC count was 11 900/pL. During days 18-27， meropen-em (MEPM； 0.5 g daily， intravenously) was added to VCM due to an increase in the WBC count (14 400/uL)， although CRP dropped to 9.19 mg/dL on day 18 and 4.19 mg on day 23. The eosinophil count exceeded 30% thereafter， and fatigue devel-oped on day 26. On day 27， MEPM was discontinued， given improved clinical symptoms and laboratory test results (WBC count 8140/pL， eosinophil count 30.7%， and CRP 2.38 mg/dL). On day 28， SpO， (room air) was satisfactory (96-99%)， but on day 30， it dropped to 95%， at which time a chest x-ray image revealed expansive consolidation of the left lung . On day 32， a further decline in SpO， (91%) was noted and a chest CT depicted widespread reticular shadowing and ground-glass opacification of the left lung in addition to a pleural effu-sion ， so MEPM (0.5 g daily， intravenously) was re-started. Thoracentesis was also performed and cultures were obtained， but an infective etiology was never proven. On day34， laboratory test results were： WBCs 7220/pL， eosinophils23.8%， CRP 5.03 mg/dL， procalcitonin 0.20 ng/mL (normal lev-els <0.05 ng/mL)， and a serum sialylated carbohydrate antigen Krebs von den Lungen - 6 level of 216.0 U/mL (normal lev-els <500.0 U/mL). Arterial blood gas analysis revealed oxygen and carbon dioxide partial pressures of 57.6 torr and 32.8 torr， respectively. During days 10-30， there was intermittent fever(up to 38.0°C) despite continuous loxoprofen sodium hydrate or acetaminophen administration for pain.\n\n【30】Lymphocyte transformation tests (LTT) directed at VCM， PIPC/TAZ，and acetaminophen in peripheral blood were con-sistently negative. Analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid on day 45 revealed 43% eosinophils， 24% macrophages，24% lymphocytes， and 9% neutrophils . There was also an abundance of eosinophils in sputum (eosinophils55%，macrophages 10%， lymphocytes 12%，neutrophils 23%). Fiberoptic bronchoscopy did not yield any remarkable obser-vations. Histamine levels were unknown because urine was not available as the patient was on dialysis.\n\n【31】Because drug-induced lung injury was suspected as well as bacterial pneumonia， on day 34， VCM and MEPM were dis-continued and linezolid (LZD； 600 mg daily， intravenously) and PIPC/TAZ were started. LZD， used instead of VCM， was targeted at MRSA， and the broad-spectrum antibiotic combi-nation PIPC/TAZ was substituted for MEPM because the pa-tient was a compromised host and the possibility of bacterial pneumonia could not be ruled out. At this point it was deter-mined that PIPC/TAZ did not induce adverse effects based on the clinical course after day 16 and negative LTT results. On discontinuation of VCM after day 34， the eosinophil count de-creased unilaterally. On day 37， the WBC count was 7880/pL\n\n【32】Isono T et al：\n\n【33】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1. Chest imaging.

Giemsa staining of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid on day45 revealed an abundance of eosinophils.</u>\n\n【35】and eosinophils dropped to 17.1%； however， the dyspnea per-sisted. On day 41， WBCs were 7230/uL and eosinophils were11.8%. On day 45， a chest CT revealed an exacerbated shad-ow in the lingula of the left upper lobe in the same location as on day 32， although eosinophils had decreased. No other new abnormal finding was detected on chest X-ray and CT on day 45 . Hence， BAL was obtained from the lin-gula of the left upper lobe. Acute EP was diagnosed from BAL findings， and prednisolone (30 mg daily， oral administration) was initiated on day 45.\n\n【36】The patient's eosinophil count normalized on day 46 and re-mained normal thereafter. On day 46， WBCs were 4340/pL and eosinophils dropped to 0%. Expectorated pink sputum collect-\n\n【37】ed on day 47 yielded Klebsiella oxytoca and Pseudomonas aeru-\n\n【38】ginosa cultures. LZD was subsequently discontinued， and faro-penem (400 mg daily， oral administration) was added to the ongoing prednisolone treatment. Radiography and CT findings of the chest had not changed， yet the patient improved suf-ficiently for discharge on day 66. The patient's clinical course is summarized in Figure 3. No recurrence was observed after\n\n【39】discharge. He did not have any symptoms other than fever and chest symptoms. Written informed consent for the pub-lication of this case was obtained from the patient and his spouse， and it was approved by the Kindai Nara University Hospital Ethics Committee.\n\n【40】Discussion\n\n【41】The present case suggests that VCM can induce EP， and that the LTT may be an unreliable indicator of reactions to VCM. Camus et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> established the following criteria to justify a diagnosis of drug-induced lung injury： 1) correct identification of the drug； 2) singularity of the drug； 3) temporal eligibility；4) characteristic clinical， imaging， BAL， and pathologic patterns of the reaction to the specific drug； and 5) exclusion of other causes of the condition. According to the Japanese Respiration Society 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， at least 1 of 3 additional provisions must also be met when diagnosing drug-induced EP： abnormal diagnostic chest imaging with eosinophilia， eosinophilic infiltration of transbronchial or open-lung biopsy specimens， or inordinate numbers of eosinophils (225%) in BAL fluid.\n\n【42】In the present patient， non-VCM causes， including surgical in-tervention， pneumothorax， and pleural empyema (all contra-lateral)， were reasonably ruled out. There had been no change in the dialyzer membrane (polyethersulfone) that could have provoked allergy， and MRSA was an unlike ly source. Eosinophils in the peripheral blood were 2.3% on day 9， MRSA empyema was present on day 9，and on day 32 the pleural fluid was clear of MRSA. Combined PIPC/TAZ treatment was excluded as a cause due to a lack of relapse upon its reintroduction on day34. Furthermore， the time-frames in which MEPM， LZD， faro-penem， and other medications were administered did not co-incide chronologically with the increase in eosinophils. VCM was the only medication administered consistently， concur-rent with increasing eosinophilia. His medical history，including\n\n【43】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3. Clinical course in the present case. Steroid therapy and vancomycin withdrawal resulted in the improvement of respiratory failure and resolved eosinophilia. VCM-vancomycin； LZD -linezolid； FRPM -faropenem； PIPC/TAZ -tazobactam/piperacillin； MEPM-meropenem； PSL-prednisolone； EOSINO -eosinophils； WBC-white blood cells.</u>\n\n【44】IgA nephropathy (decomposition of IgA in the kidney was not likely to induce EP or any allergic reactions)， angina pectoris(cured with surgery)， pneumothorax (cured)， and cholestea-toma (cured with surgery)， seemed to be pathologically unre-lated with EP. Lastly， the patient had no remarkable history of allergies. This case ultimately satisfied all criteria for drug-in-duced lung injury and drug-induced EP， with VCM being the most likely suspected candidate.\n\n【45】The patient exhibited fever despite the administration of acet-aminophen， hypoxia from day 30， widespread reticular shad-ows， ground-glass opacification of the left lung with pleuraleffu-sion of the left lung in chest CT imaging on days 32 and 45， and high eosinophil counts in BAL fluid. These observations satisfy the fourth criteria described above for drug-induced lung injury， namely “characteristic clinical， imaging， BAL， and pathologic pat-terns of the reaction to the specific drug\" 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In EP， shadowing is usually bilateral， not unilateral， as it was in the present pa-tient. However， some cases of drug-induced EP with unilateral shadowing have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， and Rhee et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> report-ed that 14 of 121 patients with acute EP exhibited unilateral pleural fluid， so unilaterality does not rule out a diagnosis of EP.\n\n【46】Notably， drugs such as antibiotics and NSAIDs are already well-known causes of EP. In an analysis of a collation of drug-in-duced EP case reports spanning nearly 30 years (1990-2017， N=196)， Bartal et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> identified 67 problematic drugs， in-cluding daptomycin， mesalamine， sulfasalazine， minocycline， NSAIDs， hydantoin/phenytoin， and risperidone. While antibi-otics are known causes of EP， this is， to the best of our knowl-edge， the first published case of VCM-induced EP. However， it is peculiar in that an unexplained and uncharacteristic 18-day lag occurred between the eosinophilic surge (day 12) and the development of hypoxia (day 30). Yi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> reported that eosinophilic infiltration was induced by secretion of the che-mokine ligands (CCLs) CCL17 and CCL12 from cDC1-lineage dendritic cells in the presence of nitric oxide (a product of CD24CD11b+ DC2 subpopulations)， whereas transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-betal)， produced by CD24+ cDC2s， inhib-it this process. Interruption of this molecular cascade may ef-fectively impose a blockade. For instance， levels of TGF-beta1may have been elevated in this patient. These higher levels of TGF-betal would then have repressed cDC1 cells from releas-ing CCL17 and CCL22 to recruit abundant eosinophils， which were already increased by VCM， from the vessels to the lung. TGF-betal is elevated in bacterial pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， including MRSA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>， giving rise to the possibility that the patient had higher TGF-beta1 levels， which could thus enable the blockade described above. The delayed diagnosis in the present case was due to a preoccupation with containing the right-sided perioperative MRSA empyema. Increased attention to rising eosinophil counts may have resulted in earlier recognition of EP and earlier initiation of treatment.\n\n【47】The time required to resolve eosinophilia after discontinuation of VCM may have been more than expected， from days 34 to46. In this period， eosinophils decreased unilaterally， and the interstitial shadow that appeared in the lingula of the left up-per lobe on the chest CT taken at day 32 (before discontinua-tion of VCM) was retained at day 45 (before initiation of PSL)， and no new abnormal finding appeared； thus， this was rec-ognized as the characteristic sequence of the medical condi-tion. Thus， no new disease， other than VCM-induced EP， had developed and other etiological candidates， including LZD and PIPC/TAZ， could be ruled out in this period. On day 45， we de-tected 43% eosinophils from BAL. These eosinophils may have moved from peripheral blood to the lung. On day 46， eosino-phils were 0%. This was because of prednisolone administra-tion on day 45 after BAL\n\n【48】The LTT is widely used to identify drugs implicated in allergic reactions. However， such testing has a number of associated technical issues and limitations， and its reliability depends on the agent targeted. Although Enomoto et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> reported LTT positivity in 56% of patients exhibiting Japanese herbal medi-cine-induced pneumonitis， previously reported data indicate that some drugs (including VCM) can prompt nonspecific lym-phocyte stimulation in vitro， causing false-positive results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In the present patient， the LTT was negative. A potential expla-nation for the negative result may be that LTT， which is used to detect an allergy type Ⅳ， T cell mediated immune response， followed the MRSA infection. The infection induced Th17 and regulatory T cells (Tregs)， which regulate the inflammatory re-sponse 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，14\\]</u>. When the LTT was performed， the MRSA infec-tion and inflammatory response were well controlled，so high levels of Tregs may have existed. Tregs may have then con-trolled not only the inflammatory response by Th17 to bacte-rial infection， but also caused the negative response to non-specific stimulation of lymphocytes (T cells) by VCM.\n\n【49】VCM can trigger DRESS syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>， Stevens-Johnson syn-drome/toxic epidermal necrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16，17\\]</u>，leukocytoclastic vascu-litis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>， agranulocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>， or red man syndrome as adverse reactions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. While the mechanisms involved in VCM-induced EP are not entirely clear， VCM promotes degranulation of mast cells and basophils， resulting in the release of histamine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. It may be that eosinophils then respond in order to modulate immediate hypersensitivity.\n\n【50】Conclusions\n\n【51】Although VCM-induced EP has not been formally described， an underreporting bias is possible. It is our view that EP due to VCM is a valid consideration， particularly if life-threatening respiratory failure ensues.\n\n【52】We thank Professor Yoshio Ohta for the cytodiagnosis and Editage for their assistance with manuscript preparation.\n\n【53】References：\n\n【54】1\\.

Coumadin inhibits the vitamin-K dependent gamma-carboxylation of coagulation factors II， VII， IX， X and the anticoagulant proteins C and S. Rarely， skin necrosis occurs when the resultant initial procoagulant state in the first few days of starting coumadin leads to throm-bosis and formation of blood clots tin the dermal capillaries. This in turn causes skin necrosis due to interruption in blood supply to the skin. Skin necrosis usually develops with initial large doses of coumadin (>10 mg/day) without bridging with heparin in the initial few days. Early recognition of this com-plication is very important because a delay in the diagnosis may lead to serious complications such as limb amputation.\n\n【26】CASE REPORT\n\n【27】Our patient is a 64 year old Caucasian female with PMH of morbid obesity， obstructive sleep apnea， chronic obstructive pulmonary disease， diabetes， hyperlipidemia and hyperten-sion who was sent to our institution from the nursing home because of acute respiratory distress. At our emergency de-partment， the patient was immediately intubated. ABGs showed respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.30 and pCO2 of64. A-a gradient was increased at 400. The patient was afe-brile but tachycardic at a rate of 110 beats per minute. CXR showed small bilateral pleural effusions. CBC showed leu-kacytosis of 13.2， normacytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 10.5 mg/dL， and normal platelets. The patient’s blood urea nitrogen and creatinine are within normal limits. Brain natriuretic peptide was only 124， troponin I was 0.01， but D-dimer level was elevated at 2036. Urinalysis wa normal. Initial assessment was respiratory failure secondary to COPD exacerbation and possible health-care associated pneumo-nia. The patient was started on steroids and antibiotics. CT angiography of the chest showed a small filling defect with-in a peripheral left upper lobe vessel. The patient was start-ed on therapeutic doses of enoxaparin. Venous Doppler of both lower extremities were negative for any deep venous thrombosis. On the 3 hospital day， the patient was started on 2.5 mg of coumadin， which was increased to 5 mg on the6 hospital day since the patient’s INR was still subtherapeu-tic. On the 7 hospital day， the patient started complaining of pain and numbness of both hands. Overnight， she devel-oped erythematous and necrotic bullous lesions on the up per extremities . INR was 2.3.\n\n【28】Coumadin-induced skin necrosis was immediately suspect-ed. Coumadin was stopped and hematology consult placed for further evaluation. The patient was given 10 mg of vita-min K， and enoxaparin was continued. Venous and arteri-al imaging of the upper extremities were done. It was nega-tive for any venous thrombosis or arterial insufficiency. The necrotic lesions started improving 3 days after the discon-tinuation of coumadin. Furthermore， the patient was extu-bated on the 11\" hospital day and was observed in the gen-eral medical floor for one day before she was transferred to a subacute rehabilitation facility.\n\n【29】DISCUSSION\n\n【30】Coumadin is an oral anticoagulant used in a variety of clin-ical conditions. Its mechanism of action involves the inhi-bition of vitamin K-induced gamma carboxylation of coag-ulation factor II， VII， IX， X and anticeagulant proteins C and S. Skin necrosis is a rare and unpredictable but well recognized complication associated with coumadin use. This typically develops during the first few days of couma-din therapy， and usually with doses >10mg/day. It occurs in0.01% to 0.1% of patients started on coumadin. This devel-ops secondary to the paradoxical transient hypercoagula-ble state produced by the suppression of the activity of the anticoagulant protein C within the first few days of couma-din use. Coumadin inhibits protein C and factor VII stron-ger than the other coagulation factors during its initial stag-es of therapy. This can be attributed to the short half-lives of these two proteins - 1.5 to 6 hours for factor VII and 8hours for protein C. The resultant hypercoagulable state leads to thrombosis and blood clots the in the dermal cap-illaries which causes skin necrosis due to interruption in the blood supply to skin. For this reason coumadin should be overlapped with parenteral anticoagulants for 4-5 days. Protein C deficiency is present in only one third of patients who develop coumadin-induced skin necrosis. Breasts， but-tocks，abdomen， thighs， extremities are common sites of in-volvement because of the large amount of subcutaneous tis-sue in these areas.\n\n【31】Coumadin-induced skin necrosis typically develops in mid-dle-aged， peri-or post-meopausal， obese females treated with coumadin for deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary em-bolism. The patient usually complains of intense pain and paresthesias in the affected areas. Lesions usually begin as an area of erytherma which progresses to form ecchymoses，\n\n【32】petechiae and hemorrhagic bullae with necrosis of the skin and subcutaneous tissue.\n\n【33】The common differential diagnosis of coumadin-induced skin necrosis are pyoderma gangrenosum， necrotizing fas-ciitis， cellulitis， ecthyma， and Fournier's gangrene (when lesions occur in the penis).\n\n【34】The initial diagnosis of coumadin-induced skin necrosis is based on clinical grounds. A high index of suspicion is re-quired for diagnosis and intervention. Coumadin should be immediately discontinued once it is suspected. Vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma should be administered to reverse the effects of coumadin. Unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin should be started to prevent further clot-ting and necrosis. Activated protein C use should be also be considered. Proper local wound care with topical anti-biotics and frequent dressing is an important part of treat-ment. Some wounds can heal without surgical intervention， but many patients need surgery for debridement and skin grafting. Early wound care consult， surgery and plastic sur-gery consult should also be obtained as needed. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy should be considered as an important ad-junctive therapy in patients at high risk for developing sig nificant morbidity and mortality. Its use has been detailed in a few case reports.\n\n【35】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【36】In coumadin-induced skin necrosis， the patient initially presents with pain and erythema， followed by petechial le-sions which progress to become purpuric. Hemorrhagic bullae with necrosis and eschar formation may soon devel-op. Once it is suspected， coumadin should be stopped and the patient should be given Vitamin K and FFP to reverse the effects of coumadin.\n\n【37】REFERENCES：\n\n【38】1\\.

She had a history of sever leg pain from 1.5 years ago， with walking difficulties. In imaging， left maxillary erosion was found. At that time， she underwent an excisional biopsy and the mass was diagnosed histologically as eosinophilic granuloma.A few months later the patient had right-sided facial pain again and consequently progressive vi-sual loss， proptosis， deformity and peri-orbital edema of the right eye， which gradually aggravated. In 2007， urge incon-tinency， sever leg pain and movement restriction appeared.\n\n【30】Neurological examination revealed moderate-to severe-para-paresis， 2/5-3/5 muscle forces， detected. On ophthalmo-logic examination，right visual acuity was 6/10 without cor-rection and 10/10 with correction. Visual acuity of the left eye was 10/10.Marcus Gunn pupil was not found.Obvious right-sided proptosis and inferior displacement of the globe were seen. Funduscopic examination revealed no optic neu-ropathy. Due to mass compression， there was macular fold-ing.

These cysts may become filled with fibrous tissue. If the highly vascularized fibrous tissue contains spots of hemorrhage， blood pigment (hemosid-erin) will accumulate， which imparts a reddish-brown hue and gives the lesion its name of “brown tumor\"， a repara-tive cellular process and not a true neoplasm. The associ-ation between osteitis fibrosa cystica and parathyroid ade-noma was first recorded in 1904 by Askanazy， whereas the link between PTH and calcium metabolism was not de-scribed until 1915.The incidence of brown tumor is 3%in primary HPT and it is caused by adenoma or hyperplasia of the parathyroid gland. In secondary HPT， the incidence of brown tumor is 1.5% to 1.7%， and it is caused by chron-ic renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，21，22\\]</u>.\n\n【49】There is a paucity of reports describing the atypical location of Brown tumor involving the orbit， the maxillofacial bones， the clavicles and the cervical spine. Patients with Brown tu-mors in the orbit may have a mass， proptosis， pain， diplopia， decreased extra ocular motility or decreased visual acuity. Brown tumors arise more frequently in the mandible than in maxilla 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> .\n\n【50】Diagnosis\n\n【51】The diagnosis of HPT is made by PTH assay. The intact PTH assay has become the most widely used， and is readily avail-able. Complemented by the elevation of alkaline phospha-tase， high ionic calcium and low phosphate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22，24\\]</u>. A defi-nite diagnosis is only possible on completion of the clinical， radiological，and biochemical analysis. Brown tumors exhib-it no pathognomonic histologic changes and differentiating between a brown tumor and other giant cell tumors may be very difficult， even with histology. Fibrous dysplasia affects the bones of the face， and it is most common among young women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，12\\]</u>. The differential diagnosis (DDX) consid-ered in the present case， based on clinical and radiologic findings， included osteosarcoma， metastatic lesions， aneu-rysmal bone cyst，eosinophilic granuloma， cholesteatoma， and adenoid cystic carcinoma of the lacrimal gland. The his-topathologic DDX included giant cell tumor of bone，aneu-rysmal bone cyst， osteosarcoma and brown tumor of HPT.\n\n【52】Treatment\n\n【53】Parathyroidectomy is the treatment of choice for primary HPT. However， opinions are divided as to the treatment of bone lesions. Authors such as Scott et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u> believe that bone lesions reappear spontaneously following removal of the diseased parathyroid gland.Others， such as Martinez-Gavidia et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>， recommended initial treatment with systemic corticosteroids in order to reduce the tumor size， followed by surgical removal of the residual lesions. In the case of large destructive cysts， the amount of tissue dam-aged may be so great that there are few possibilities of re-modeling once normocalcemia has been achieved. Yamazaki et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u> recommended curettage and enucleation in these situations or in cases where the lesions continue for more than 6 months， there is disruption of the function of the af-fected organ， or growth despite adequate metabolic control. Curative surgical ablation for parathyroid adenoma/hyper-plasia includes resection of the adenoma and subtotal and total parathyroidectomy， coupled with subcutaneous auto-transplantation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16，18，19，22\\]</u>.\n\n【54】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【55】Nowadays brown tumor is an extremely rare manifestation of primary HPT. A delay in diagnosis and in curative para-thyroidectomy can result in unnecessary complications such as progressive blindness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Once hyperparathyroidism is controlled， the tumor tends to regress， although in some cases such as ours surgical removal is necessary， especially for patients who have large symptomatic tumors.

Despite this， FH remains largely underdiagnosed and undertreated in primary care. In this case series， we report 3 FH cases detected in primary care due to mutations in the low-density lipo-protein receptor (LDLR)， apolipoprotein-B (APOB)， and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) genes. The mutations in case 1 (frameshift c.660del pathogenic variant in LDLR gene) and case 2 (missense c.10579C>T pathogenic variant in APOB gene) were confirmed as pathogenic， while the mutation in case 3 (mis-sense c.277C>T mutation in PCSK9 gene) may have been benign. In case 1， the patient had the highest LDL-C level， 8.6 mmol/L， and prominent tendon xanthomas. In case 2， the patient had an LDL-c level of 5.7 mmol/L and premature corneal arcus. In case 3， the patient had an LDL-c level of 5.4 mmol/L but had neither of the classical physical findings. Genetic counseling and diagnosis were delivered by primary care physicians. These index cases were initially managed in primary care with statins and therapeutic lifestyle modifications. They were referred to the lipid specialists for up-titration of lipid lowering medications. First-degree relatives were identified and referred for cascade testing.\n\n【32】Conclusions：\n\n【33】This case series highlights different phenotypical expressions in patients with 3 different FH genetic mutations. Primary care physicians should play a pivotal role in the detection of FHindex cases， genetic testing， manage-ment， and cascade screening of family members， in partnership with lipid specialists.\n\n【34】Publisher's note： All daims expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of their affiliated\n\n【35】AP\n\n【36】organizations， or those of the publisher the editors and the reviewers.

It is one of the most common monogenic diseases that leads to an elevated risk of premature atherosclerosis， due to its ef-fect on plasma cholesterol levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. FH is commonly caused by mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene， apolipoprotein B (APOB) gene， and/or proprotein con-vertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) gene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， with the most common mutations found in the LDLR gene， followed by APOB and PCSK9 genes \\[4j. Other rare mutations in the LDL recep-tor adaptor protein 1 (LDLRAP1) gene， apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene， and ATP-binding cassette subfamily G members 5 and 8(ABCG5 and ABCG8) genes have been reported to be responsi-ble for the recessive form of FH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>. There are 2 forms of FH：the heterozygous form (HeFH)， in which the patients have 1normal allele and 1 mutated allele； and the homozygous form(HoFH)， in which patients have 2 mutated alleles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【42】Clinically， the key characteristics of patients with FH are se-verely elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)， premature corneal arcus (<45 years old)， and tendon xantho-mas， predominantly in the Achilles tendon and on the exten-sor tendons of the elbows， hands， knees， and toes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>. FH can be identified and diagnosed using established clinical di-agnostic criteria， such as Simon Broome (SB) criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> and Dutch Lipid Clinic Criteria (DLCC) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Genetic testing to con-firm the diagnosis can be offered if resources are available 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【43】HoFH is rarely reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>， with a global prevalence estimat-ed at 1 in 160 000 to 1 in 300 000 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. HeFH is more common， with a global prevalence estimated at 1 in 200 to 1 in 500 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis showed that the pooled prevalence of HeFH based on genetic testing or estab-lished clinical diagnostic criteria among the general adult pop-ulation was 1 in 303 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. In Malaysia， the prevalence of clini-cally diagnosed HeFH was estimated to be 1 in 100 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>，while the prevalence of genetically confirmed HeFH was recently re-ported as 1 in 427 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. This is comparable to the prevalence in other countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【44】If FH is left untreated， men with FH have a 50% risk of devel-oping coronary artery disease (CAD) by the age of 50 years， and women with FH have a 30% risk of developing CAD by the\n\n【45】age of 60 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. FH remains underdiagnosed and undertreated， especially in the primary care setting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. This results in a lost opportunity for preventing premature CAD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，15\\]</u>. Therefore， early identification in primary care of patients who are at risk of FH is pivotal. However， the established clinical criteria， such as SB and DLCC， have limited utility for the purposes of case-finding in primary care 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>， as they were developed from sec-ondary care registers of FH patients. These diagnostic criteria would require a comprehensive physical examination (tendon xanthoma and arcus cornealis)， family history recording， and genetic mutation testing， which are not routinely assessed or are inadequately documented in primary care. As a conse-quence， researchers in the United Kingdom have developed a new case-finding tool， the Familial Hypercholesterolemia Case Ascertainment Tool (FAMCAT)， based on a risk prediction algo-rithm developed and validated from primary care databases通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18，19\\]</u>. In Malaysia， genetic testing is not routinely available due to limited financial resources as well as a lack of exper-tise to conduct genetic testing. Therefore， the SB， DLCC， and FAMCAT can be used to identify FH cases in primary care when genetic testing is unavailable.\n\n【46】With or without genetic testing， patients with clinically diag-nosed FH are at a very high risk to develop atherosclerotic car-diovascular diseases (ASCVD) and therefore should be treated with high-dose potent statins and therapeutic lifestyle modi-fications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20，21\\]</u>. If patients fail to achieve an LDL-c target of<1.8 mmol/L， the current Malaysian clinical practice guideline recommends the combination of high-dose potent statins with either ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Since FH is an inherited genetic condition， its diagnosis should lead to cas-cade screening of family members to identify those affect-ed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. In this case series， we report 3 patients with FH who were clinically diagnosed in primary care and， subsequently， were genetically tested.\n\n【47】Case Reports\n\n【48】Methodology\n\n【49】The 3 patients reported in this case series were participants of a study titled\"Reducing Premature Coronary Artery Disease by Early Identification of Familial Hypercholesterolemia： The UK-Malaysia Joint-Partnership Call on Non-Communicable Diseases\"\n\n【50】(grant reference： 100-TNCPI/GOV 16/6/2 \\[002/2020\\]-02 and MR/T 017384/1).\n\n【51】These 3 patients were identified in the primary care setting from September 2020 to April 2021 and were invited to partic-ipate. A patient information sheet about the study was given， and written informed consent was obtained upon recruitment into the study. Written informed consent to use the clinical data and digital images was also obtained from all patients in this case series.\n\n【52】Demographic data (age， ethnicity， education level， marital sta-tus， household income， and family history) were obtained from the patients. Information on symptoms of angina and periph-eral vascular disease (PVD) were collected using the WHO Rose Angina Questionnaire 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u> and Edinburgh Claudication Questionnaire 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>，respectively. Information on potential sec-ondary causes of hypercholesterolemia， such as chronic kidney disease (CKD)， diabetes， and hypothyroidism， were obtained from the patients and verified with their electronic medical records (EMR). Data on current medications and the highest ever recorded fasting serum lipid profiles were obtained from the EMR. Family history variables (elevated cholesterol lev-el， FH， and myocardial infarction) were collected using a vali-dated Family History Questionnaire， which has been translat-ed into the Malay language. Physical examinations to identify tendon xanthomas and corneal arcus were conducted during the consultation.\n\n【53】Using these variables， the SB criteria， DLCC score，and FAMCAT relative risk score was assessed for each patient. They would be clinically diagnosed to have FH if they fulfilled“definite”or“possible\" FH by SB criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， DLCC score 26 (“definite”or“probable”FH) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>， or FAMCAT algorithm relative risk score>1 (high probability of FH) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. The 3 patients were found to fulfill at least 1 of the FH clinica! diagnostic criteria. Therefore， they were offered genetic testing. Primary care physicians were trained by the lipid specialists to deliver genetic counseling to the patients prior to genetic testing. Patients were coun-seled regarding their risk of having FH， the pattern of inher-itance， the genetic testing procedure， confirmation of diag-nosis after the genetic testing， further management， and the need for cascade screening of first-degree relatives once they are genetically diagnosed. Written informed consent was ob-tained from the patients.\n\n【54】Approximately 10 mL of venous blood sample was collected from the patients into an ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid tube at the primary care clinics. These samples were kept in a temperature-controlled container and delivered to the Universiti Teknologi MARA genetic laboratory within 3 h of collection.Once received， genomic DNA was extracted from the whole blood collected using a MasterPure DNA Purification Kit for Blood\n\n【55】Version II (Epicentre， Madison， Winsconsin)， according to the manufacturer's protocol. The concentration and purity of ex-tracted DNA were determined using a SpectraMax QuickDrop micro-volume spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices， San Jose， CA， USA) followed by a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific， Wilmington， DE， USA). The samples were then sub-jected to targeted next generation sequencing， covering all the exons (including the exon-intron boundaries) and the 5'and3'untranslated regions of the 4 FH major genes (LDLR， APOB， PCSK9， and LDLRAP1). Library preparation was performed us-ing an AmpliSeq Library PLUS kit (Illumina， San Diego， CA， USA)， and enriched samples were sequenced on an ISeq 100sequencer platform (Illumina， San Diego， CA， USA)， according to the manufacturer's instructions. A GRCh37 hg19 human reference assembly was used to map genomic sequencing data using the proprietary BaseSpace Sequence Hub applica-tion (Illumina， San Diego， CA， USA). A Germline Variant Caller(Illumina， San Diego， CA， USA) was used to perform variant calling. Only variants with minor allele frequency <5% in the1000 Genomes database were assessed， using in silico web-based software， ClinVar and Leiden Open Variation Database， previous published reports， and clinical data from the 3 cas-es. The pathogenicity of the variants was agreed based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guide-lines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>， by which variants were classified as pathogenic， like-ly pathogenic， benign， likely benign， or variants of uncertain significance. Likely pathogenic and pathogenic variants were collectively referred to as pathogenic variants.\n\n【56】Lipid specialists trained the primary care physicians to deliver genetic analysis results to the patients. During consultation， pa-tients who were genetically confirmed to have FH were coun-seled regarding the nature of the genetic mutations， mode of inheritance， and need for further management， including cas-cade screening of first-degree relatives. The importance of ad-herence to lifestyle modification and pharmacotherapy were emphasized. Lipid-lowering treatment for each patient was reviewed and up-titrated to achieve an LDL-c target of <1.8mmol/L 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20，22\\]</u>. Patients were also supported psychosocially on how to adapt with the condition. They were referred to the Universiti Teknologi MARA lipid specialists for further manage-ment and for the cascade screening of first-degree relatives.\n\n【57】Case 1\n\n【58】This patient was a 39-year-old Malay woman， working as a civil servant， who presented to a primary care clinic for rou-tine follow-up for hypercholesterolemia. She was on atorvas-tatin 20 mg at night and therapeutic lifestyle modification， which included advice on dietary intake and physical activi-ty. This patient was asymptomatic， with no personal history of hypertension， diabetes， or hypothyroidism. The WHO Rose Angina Questionnaire 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u> and the Edinburgh Claudication\n\n【59】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1. Family pedigree chart for case 1.</u>\n\n【60】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2. Tendon xanthomas on the metacarpophalangeal joints and Achilles tendon.</u>\n\n【61】Questionnaire 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u> were negative. There was also no history of CAD， cerebrovascular disease (CVD)， PVD， or CKD. She was a non-smoker and did not drink alcohol.\n\n【62】It was noted that she had a strong family history of elevated cholesterol level and premature CAD， particularly on the pa-ternal side. Her father was suspected to have FH at the age of 42 years old. He had an episode of myocardial infarction(MI) at the age of 46 years old and eventually underwent cor-onary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 1 year after the MI， at the age of 47 years. He was currently 65 years old and was be-ing treated with a PCSK9 inhibitor as a lipid-lowering treat-ment. Her paternal grandfather and uncle were also suspect-ed to have FH and were reported to have tendon xanthomas.\n\n【63】On the maternal side， the family history was uneventful， as her maternal grandfather had a minor stroke at the age of 82years old. Despite these findings， none of her family members had undergone genetic testing. Her family pedigree chart is shown in Figure 1.\n\n【64】On examination， her vital signs were normal. There were ten-don xanthomas on her bilateral metacarpophalangeal joints， Achilles tendon， and knees. There was no premature corneal arcus. Other physical examinations， including of the cardio-vascular and respiratory systems， were unremarkable. Figure 2shows the physical examination findings.\n\n【65】Kamal A. et al：\n\n【66】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3. Family pedigree chart for case 2.</u>\n\n【67】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4. Stage 4 corneal arcus in both eyes.</u>\n\n【68】According to the data extracted from her EMR， the highest cho-lesterol level was noted in 2019， with an LDL-c of 8.6 mmol/L and a total cholesterol (TC) of 10.4 mmol/L In terms of clini-cal diagnosis， this patient fulfilled the SB criteria (definite FH)， DLCC (score of 16： definite FH)， and FAMCAT (relative risk score of 32.3). Upon targeted next generation sequencing analysis， the patient was found to carry a frameshift c.660del patho-genic variant in the LDLR gene (rs875989905) located in exon4. The type of mutation was frameshift mutation p.Asp221fs. Therefore， this patient was confirmed to have HeFH by genetic testing. Despite pharmacological therapy with statin and ther-apeutic lifestyle modification， she failed to achieve the LDL-C target of <1.8 mmol/L and was therefore referred to the lipid\n\n【69】specialists for further management. Cascade screening of first-degree relatives is currently being conducted by the lipid spe-cialists in order to identify those affected with FH.\n\n【70】Case 2\n\n【71】This patient was an unemployed 57-year-old Chinese woman， diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia at the age of 55 years， and with no other known medical illness. She presented at a primary care clinic for a routine follow-up. This patient was on simvastatin 20 mg at night and received advice on dietary in-take and physical activity. During this visit， she was assessed using the WHO Rose Angina Questionnaire 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u> and described\n\n【72】having a history of central chest tightness at the age of 55years， which resolved in less than 5 min. The pain was worse after a meal and was not exacerbated by exertion or physical activity. She never had any chest pain at rest or any chest dis-comfort that lasted more than 30 min. She did not seek med-ical attention at the time， and it was not further investigat-ed. She was also assessed using the Edinburgh Claudication Questionnaire 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u> and was found to be negative for the pres-ence of PVD symptoms. There was no personal history of sec-ondary causes of hypercholesterolemia， such as diabetes， hy pertension， or hypothyroidism. There was no history of CAD， CVD， PVD， or CKD recorded in her EMR. She drank alcohol oc-casionally but did not smoke cigarettes.\n\n【73】This patient has a significant family history of hypercholester-olemia. Her father， elder sister， younger brother， and younger sister were all on lipid-lowering therapy. She noted that her elder sister had xanthelasma around the eyes and premature corneal arcus in her forties. Her younger brother also had pre-mature corneal arcus in his forties. Her mother died of a re-current stroke at the age of 56 years old； the first stroke oc-curred at the age of 54 years. Figure 3 depicts the patient's family pedigree chart.\n\n【74】On examination， she was well and did not appear to be in pain. Her vital signs were normal. Stage 4 corneal arcus was present in both eyes， as shown in Figure 4； she noticed that they started in her thirties. Other physical examinations were unremarkable.\n\n【75】According to the data extracted from her EMR， the highest cho-lesterol level was noted in 2019， with an LDL-c of 5.7 mmol/L and TC of 8.5 mmol/L Based on these findings， this patient ful-filled the SB criteria (possible FH)， DLCC (score of 14： definite FH)， and FAMCAT (relative risk score of 4.4). The genetic anal-ysis of this patient showed a missense c.10579C>T pathogenic variant in the APOB gene (rs144467873)， located in exon 26. The type of mutation was a missense mutation，p.Arg3527Trp， which confirmed the diagnosis of HeFH in this patient.\n\n【76】This patient was immediately referred to the family medicine specialist at the primary care clinic for further assessment of her chest pain. Her resting electrocardiogram was normal， and she was given a follow-up appointment with the family medi-cine specialist for further monitoring of her chest pain. Despite pharmacological therapy and therapeutic lifestyle modification， her LDL-c and TC levels remained high and she failed to achieve the LDL-c target of <1.8 mmol/L Therefore， she was also re-ferred to the lipid specialists for further management. Cascade screening of first-degree relatives is currently being conducted by the lipid specialists in order to identify those affected with FH.\n\n【77】Case 3\n\n【78】This patient was a 41-year-old Malay man with underlying hypertension. He was working as a government official. He came to a primary care clinic for a routine follow-up. He was asymptomatic， with no subclinical evidence of ASCVD. There was no personal history of hypercholesterolemia， diabetes， or\n\n【79】hypothyroidism. The WHO Rose Angina Questionnaire 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u> and the Edinburgh Claudication Questionnaire 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u> were negative. There was no history of CAD， CVD， PVD， or CKD recorded in the EMR. This patient had stopped smoking in 2016. He had smoked 10 pack years of cigarettes since he was 18 years old. His mother had a stroke at 60 years of age. There were no oth-er family members with history of hypercholesterolemia， CAD， CVD， or PVD. His family pedigree chart is shown in Figure 5.\n\n【80】On examination， his vital signs were normal. There was no ten-don xanthoma or premature corneal arcus. Other physical ex-aminations， including the cardiovascular and respiratory sys-tems， were unremarkable.\n\n【81】According to the data extracted from his EMR， the highest cho-lesterol level was noted in 2020， with an LDL-c of 5.4 mmol/L and a TC of 7.3 mmol/L This patient fulfilled the SB criteria (pos-sible FH) but did not fulfill the DLCC (score of 4) and FAMCAT(relative risk score of 0.6). The genetic analysis of this patient showed a missense c.277C>T mutation in the PCSK9 gene(rs151193009)， which was located within exon 2. There are conflicting findings whether this particular mutation is patho-genic， a variant of uncertain significance， or benign 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28-31\\]</u>.\n\n【82】He was initially managed in primary care with simvastatin 10mg at night and therapeutic lifestyle modification， which in-cluded advice on dietary intake and physical activity. However， he failed to achieve the LDL-c target of <1.8 mmol/L and was therefore referred to the lipid specialists for further manage-ment. Cascade screening of first-degree relatives is currently being conducted by the lipid specialists.\n\n【83】Table 1 shows a summary of all 3 patients selected for this case series， who were identified in primary care and had sub-sequently been genetically tested.\n\n【84】Discussion\n\n【85】This case series is the first to report genetically confirmed HeFH in the Malaysian primary care setting. We presented 3 cases of patients aged 39 to 57 years old with LDLR， APOB， and PCSK9gene mutations. In case 1， the patient was confirmed to have a pathogenic LDLR gene frameshift mutation， while the patient in case 2 was confirmed to have a pathogenic APOB gene mis-sense mutation. In case 3， the patient had a PCSK9 missense c.277C>T mutation on p.Arg93Cys (rs151193009). There are conflicting findings whether this particular mutation is patho-genic， a variant of uncertain significance， or benign 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28-31\\]</u>.\n\n【86】In Asian populations， including Malaysian， the most common FH mutation that has been described is of the LDLR gene通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32-34\\]</u>， followed by APOB and PCSK9 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. It was previously\n\n【87】reported that only 10% to 15% of FH cases in Asia was attrib-utable to APOB gene mutations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>， which is more common in Taiwan (9.2%) and China (10.9%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>. In contrast， muta-tions of the PCSK9 gene were more common in Japan， with a frequency of 7.8%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>. PCSK9 mutation was found to be rare in China and Korea， and none was reported in Taiwan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>. In Malaysia， published literature that described the prevalence of APOB and PCSK9 gene mutations is limited 32\\].\n\n【88】With regards to LDL-c levels， the patients presented in this case series had high levels of LDL-c， ranging from 5.4 to 8.6 mmol/L which is 3 to 5 times higher than the target value of 1.8 mmol/L for individuals at very high cardiovascular risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.This find-ing is similar to that of a Canadian study involving 313 genet-ically confirmed HeFH patients， in which 42% of the patients had LDL-c levels between 5.0 and 6.0 mmol/L， and 88% of the patients had an LDL-c level above 8.0 mmol/L 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. It was ob-served that the patient in case 1， who was confirmed to have an LDLR gene mutation， had the highest LDL-c level at 8.6 mmol/L compared with case 2 with an APOB gene mutation and level of 5.7 mmol/L and case 3 with a PCSK9 gene mutation and lev-el of 5.4 mmol/L. Typically， FH patients with mutations in the LDLR gene show the highest LDL-c levels compared with pa-tients with mutations in other FH candidate genes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38，39\\]</u>. The genetic defects in the LDLR gene causes LDL-c to be removed from the circulation at half the normal rate， causing an accu-mulation of lipoprotein level in the blood at 2-fold above nor-mal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>. The c.660delC pathogenic variants results from a de-letion of 1 nucleotide at position 660， causing a translational frameshift change with a predicted stop codon (p.Asp221fs). This mutation has been reported among FH cohorts from various ethnic groups 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41，42\\]</u>. This LDLR pathogenic variant is expected to result in premature protein truncation or nonsense-mediat-ed mRNA decay， with subsequent loss of protein function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[43\\]</u>.\n\n【89】With regards to the p.Arg3527Trp pathogenic variant that is lo-cated in the APOB gene， our finding is consistent with the find-ings of other studies which observed that among patients of the same age， body mass index， and sex， those with an APOB gene defect had elevated LDL-c values but relatively lower val-ues than those with a pathogenic LDLR gene mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44，45\\]</u>. Additionally， for p.Arg3527Trp， the arginine at codon 3527 is replaced by tryptophan， an amino acid with different proper-ties. Adding to that， it is located in an APOB region that is vi-tal for protein folding and stability， suggesting that this vari-ant can affect protein function. Based on this evidence， this variant is classified as pathogenic for FH.\n\n【90】The PCSK9 missense c.277C>T mutation on p.Arg93Cys found in case 3 has never been previously reported in the Malaysian population. This mutation was described as a pathogenic vari-ant among a Chinese population with premature acute MI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. However， 3 other studies showed that this loss-of-function\n\n【91】Table 1.

In case 3， the patient fulfilled the SB criteria as “possible FH\"， because the highest LDL-c level was 5.4 mmol/L， and his mother had a stroke at 60years old. He did not have any subclinical evidence of ASCVD. Therefore， the PCSK9 missense c.277C>T mutation in this patient may not have been pathogenic. However， he failed to achieve the LDL-c treatment target of <1.8 mmol/L. This patient was still referred to the lipid specialists for up-titration of lipid low-ering treatment and cascade screening of first-degree relatives.\n\n【97】A higher LDL-c level in the blood has been associated with a more severe expression of phenotypes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[46\\]</u>. Phenotypically， we found that the patient in case 1， who was confirmed to have LDLR deletion gene mutation， presented with a more severe phenotype， namely tendon xanthomas， compared with the\n\n【98】patient in case 2 with APOB pathogenic variants. These find-ings are parallel to a previous local study involving 164 FH pa-tients， in which those with a frameshift mutation of the LDLR gene showed a more severe phenotype expression and higher LDL-c level通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44\\]</u>.

Regarding the APOB gene mutation， although the expres-sion is less severe phenotypically compared with that of carri-ers of LDLR gene defects， the APOB gene mutation is still more strongly associated with a higher risk of CVD and TC： HDL ra-tio than in those without mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44\\]</u>.\n\n【99】FH is still currently underdiagnosed in Malaysia， with a detec-tion rate estimated at 0.5%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. Primary care physicians should have a high index of suspicion in patients presenting with LDL-c levels of >4.9 mmol/L 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22，23\\]</u>. In this case series， prima-ry care physicians were trained on how to perform a thorough\n\n【100】physical examination and to be familiar with the appropriate clinical diagnostic tools， such as the SB， DLCC， and FAMCAT case-finding tool. Referral for genetic testing should be con-sidered if the patient fulfills the clinical diagnostic criteria and if genetic testing is routinely available， as this is the criterion standard to diagnose FH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[48\\]</u>. As with many developing coun-tries， genetic testing is not routinely available in Malaysia ow-ing to limited financial resources. However， in this case series， patients who fulfilled at least 1 of the FH clinical diagnostic criteria were offered genetic testing， which was funded by the study. Primary care physicians were trained by the lipid special-ists to deliver genetic counseling to the patients prior to ge-netic testing. The counseling included informing the patients of their risk of having FH， the pattern of inheritance， genetic testing procedure， confirmation of diagnosis after the genetic testing， further management， and need for cascade screening of first-degree relatives once they are genetically diagnosed.\n\n【101】Primary care physicians were also trained to deliver genetic analysis results to the patients. In this cases series， once the patients were confirmed to have FH， they were counseled re-garding the nature of the genetic mutations and mode of in-heritance. These patients’ cases were initially managed in pri-mary care with statins and therapeutic lifestyle modification， which included advice on dietary intake and physical activity. Patients with FH are recommended to receive individualized advice about diet， physical activity， and healthy weight main-tenance from healthcare providers to reduce their cardiovas-cular risks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[49-51\\]</u>. With regards to the pharmacological man-agement for patients with FH， the current Malaysian clinical practice guideline recommends the combination of high-dose potent statins with either ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors for those who fail to achieve the LDL-c target of <1.8 mmol/L 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. However， awareness of FH is lacking among primary care phy sicians 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，52，53\\]</u>， which may explain the low-potency statins being prescribed for patients in this case series. While access to ezetimibe and a PCSK9 inhibitor are limited for primary care physicians， higher-potency statins， such as atorvastatin， are widely available in primary care and should be used ap-propriately. In this case series， these patients were referred to the lipid specialists for up-titration of lipid-lowering med-ication， as they failed to achieve the LDL-c treatment target.\n\n【102】Apart from pharmacological treatment with lipid-lowering med-ications， cascade screening of first-degree relatives should also be conducted to allow early detection and management of this autosomal dominant disorder. Cascade screening is a cost-ef-fective method to identify additional cases of FH through sys-tematic family tracing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[54\\]</u>. In this case series， primary care physicians also played a significant role in identifying first-de-gree relatives to be referred for cascade testing. Early detec-tion of FH will reduce the average age at which family mem-bers are diagnosed with FH and increase the percentage of\n\n【103】them receiving pharmacological treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[54\\]</u>. In addition to the above measures， long-term follow-up by both a primary care physician and lipid specialist is vital to ensure patients with FH achieve the LDL-c target， hence preventing prema-ture ASCVD. The need to integrate the pivotal role of primary care physicians with that of the lipid specialists’ service to en-hance the detection and management of FH in the communi-ty is well recognized 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[55\\]</u>. There is extensive evidence to show that this approach is clinically and financially effective 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[56-58\\]</u>.\n\n【104】Additionally， accurate national registries on the prevalence of FH would assist in increasing the awareness of this condition among clinicians 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[59\\]</u>. In Malaysia， a national level FH registry is currently being established 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[60\\]</u>. Clinical practice guidelines on the management of FH in Malaysia should also be established to improve early detection and treatment of FH， especially in pri-mary care， which serves as the front-line of the healthcare set-ting. It is hoped that these systematic and widespread efforts will improve the prevention of premature ASCVD in this population.\n\n【105】Conclusions\n\n【106】In summary， we reported 3 cases of patients with mutations of LDLR， APOB， and PCSK9 genes seen in primary care. Consistent with the literature， the patient with the LDLR gene mutation in this case series showed a higher LDL-c level and a more prom-inent phenotype compared with the other 2 patients. This case series highlights the differences in phenotypical expression in patients with genetic mutations of 3 different genes. Primary care physicians should have a high index of suspicion in pa-tients presenting with LDL-c levels of >4.9 mmol/L. These pa-tients should be thoroughly assessed and clinically diagnosed with established clinical diagnostic criteria， such as the SB and DLCC， as well as the FAMCAT case-finding tool. Referral for ge-netic testing should be considered if the testing is routinely available. With or without genetic testing， clinically diagnosed patients with FH should be treated accordingly， with combina-tions of high-dose potent lipid-lowering medications， and cas-cade screening of first-degree relatives should be performed. Primary care physicians should play a pivotal role in the de-tection of FH index cases， genetic testing， management， and cascade screening of family members in partnership with the lipid specialists. Establishment of a national FH registry and clinical practice guideline are also important to improve aware-ness and guide the treatment of patients with FH and subse-quently reduce morbidity and mortality from premature ASCVD.\n\n【107】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgment</u>\n\n【108】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The study protocol was approved by the respective research ethics committees in Malaysia i.e. the UiTM Research Ethics Committee \\[(REC/03/2020)(FB/48)\\] and the Medical Research</u>\n\n【109】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethics Committee of the Ministry of Health Malaysia \\[NMRR-20-272-52797 (IIR)\\].

Congenital asplenia is extremely rare and is of 2 distinct types： hetero-taxy syndromes and isolated congenital asplenia (ICA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Ivemark syndrome is one of the heterotaxy syndromes char-acterized by asplenia，malformations of the heart， and malpo-sition of internal organs in the chest and abdomen. ICA cases are also fatal in childhood， but there are reported living adult cases. Those affected are typically at increased risk for fulmi-nant sepsis and can have a higher risk of noninfectious com-plications， such as thrombocytosis and mesenteric thrombo-sis. We report the first case in the United States of ICA with jejunal AVM responsible for multiple episodes of unexplained melena and severe iron deficiency over a 7-year period in a22-year-old male.\n\n【22】Case Report\n\n【23】A 22-year-old，adopted， white male presented to our hospi-tal with persistent microcytic anemia and recurrent melena. Medical history included congenital asplenia with frequent childhood infections. Congenital asplenia was diagnosed at2 years old by ultrasound， which failed to demonstrate the spleen.Echocardiography revealed no detectable situs anom-alies or cardiac defects at 19 years old. Melena was first de-tected at 15 years old. Colonoscopy and esophagogastroduo-denoscopy along with extensive anemia workup did not reveal the cause of anemia at that time. The patient had intermit-tent melena 2-3 times per month since then， with a baseline hemoglobin of 12 mg/dL He received multiple transfusions in the past for significant iron-deficiency anemia. On physical ex-amination， he was hemodynamically stable， without evident cutaneous or mucosal telangiectasias，and had mild general-ized abdominal tenderness. Pertinent abnormal laboratory re-sults included hemoglobin 6.6 g/dl， hematocrit 22.3%， mean corpuscular volume 61.2 u， and platelet count 504x10/uL. Contrast-enhanced CT abdomen and pelvis confirmed absence of the spleen . Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed grade I erosive esophagitis with no active signs of bleeding. Intravenous iron infusion and capsule endoscopy were then initiated. The capsule study identified obscure gastrointesti-nal bleeding with a lesion proximal to the mid-jejunum and a possible second lesion in the lower jejunum. A subsequent en-teroscopy with biopsy was consistent with AVMs， which were treated with 2 hemoclips and epinephrine injection， with suc-cessful hemostasis . Six months later， the patient has reported no further episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding and his hemoglobin has remained stable.\n\n【24】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1. Contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen： the absence of a spleen is noted on the left.</u>\n\n【25】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2. Jejunal biopsy.</u>\n\n【26】Discussion\n\n【27】The spleen is a mesodermal derivative which first appears as a condensation of mesenchymal cells inside the dorsal me-sogastrium at the end of the fourth embryonic week. It plays an essential role in generalized hematopoietic and lympho-poietic disorders， systemic infection， sepsis， and immunolog-ic-inflammatory disorders. Some congenital anomalies of the spleen are common， such as splenic lobulation and accesso-ry spleen， while other conditions are rare， especially isolated congenital asplenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Congenital asplenia， a poorly understood and rare form of pri-mary immunodeficiency， is either associated with malforma-tion syndromes such as heterotaxia， or it is an isolated find-ing， as was the case in our patient. Heterotaxia syndrome with situs abnormalities (Ivemark syndrome， OMIM # 208530) is a sporadic， autosomal recessive syndrome seen in cases of pa-rental consanguinity. Patients with Ivemark syndrome gener-ally die by the age of 6 months.\n\n| Case No.  | Familial or sporadic  | Age at diagnosis/gender  | Clinical presentation  | Outcome  | Reference  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | Sporadic  | 36 years/Male  | Pneumococcal sepsis/Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome  | Deceased  | 10  |\n| 2  | Sporadic  | 37 years/Male  | Thrombocytosis  | Alive  | 11  |\n| 3  | Sporadic  | 56 years/Female  | Thrombocytosis/myocardial infarction  | Alive  | 12  |\n| 4  | Sporadic  | 56 years/Male  | Thrombocytosis  | Alive  | 12  |\n| 5  | Sporadic  | 60 years/Female  | Pneumococcal sepsis  | Alive  | 13  |\n| 6  | Sporadic  | 77 years/Male  | Mesenteric vein thrombosis  | Alive  | 7  |\n| 7  | Sporadic  | 52 years/Female  | Pneumococcal sepsis  | Deceased  | 14  |\n| 8  | Sporadic  | 72 years/Male  | Thrombocytosis  | Alive  | 15  |\n| 9  | Familial  | 20 years/Female  | Pneumococcal sepsis/2 children affected  | Alive  | 3  |\n| 10  | Familial  | 35 years/Male  | Asymptomatic/5 children affected  | Alive  | 3  |\n| 11  | Familial  | 45 years/Male  | Meningitis-pneumococcal/2 childrenaffected  | Alive  | 16  |\n| 12  | Familial  | Unknown/Male  | Asymptomatic/1 child affected  | Alive  | 17  |\n| 13  | Familial  | 25 years/Male  | Thrombocytosis/1 child affected  | Alive  | 17  |\n| 14  | Familial  | Unknown/Female  | Asymptomatic/2 children affected  | Alive  | 18  |\n| 15  | Familial  | 27 years/Male  | Asymptomatic/sister affected with AVM  | Alive  | 19  |\n| 16  | Adopted  | 22 years/Male  | Small bowel AVM bleed，Mycoplasmapneumonia  | Alive  | Our case  |\n| 17  | Sporadic  | 28 years/Male  | Streptococcal pneumonia/ulcerativecolitis  | Alive  | 20  |\n| 18  | Sporadic  | 44 years/Female  | Thrombocytosis/Chronic thromboembolic pulmonaryhypertension  | Alive  | 21  |\n| 19  | Sporadic  | 67 years/Female  | Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome/lungfibrosis  | Deceased  | 22  |\n\n【30】AVM - arteriovenous malformation.\n\n【31】On the other hand， ICA (OMIM 271400)， with the plausible au-tosomal dominant mode of inheritance， is often fatal in early childhood or complicated with life-threatening infections such as meningitis and purpura fulminans or noninfectious compli-cations such as thrombocytosis and mesenteric thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【32】Bolze et al. studied 33 patients with isolated congenital asple-nia from 23 kindreds， including 5 kindreds previously reported by Mahlaoui et al. and the family described by Ferlicot et al.， suggested that heterozygous coding mutations in RPSA on chromosome 3p21 underlie most cases of isolated congenital asplenia， with apparently complete penetrance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-5\\]</u>.RPSA is not likely to have been identified through a candidate-gene approach， as RPSA is ubiquitously expressed and is not known to be involved in spleen development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【33】Furthermore， there are no large studies to confirm the rela-tionship between asplenia (syndrome or isolated) and AVMs of the gastrointestinal tract. AVM is an acquired or congeni-tal vascular ectasia that has a propensity to bleed spontane-ously and can be found anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract. AVMs are typically divided into 3 types 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Type l are solitary and limited to the right colon， usually manifesting in patients over 55 years of age. Type ll are larger， congenital， and tend to occur in the small bowel in patients less than 55 years of age. Type Ill are frequently associated with hereditary hem-orrhagic telangiectasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Approximately 5% of obscure and overt Gl bleed have a small bowel source not visible on EGD and colonoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Aortic stenosis， Von Willebrand disease， HHT， and end-stage renal disease can be associated with AVM gastrointestinal bleeding. Gastrointestinal bleeding has been\n\n【34】estimated to occur in 13-25% of HHT， formerly known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome (OMIM # 187300). Inherited as au-tosomal dominant， HHT is characterized by epistaxis， cutane-ous telangiectatic lesions， and a large AVM in the brain， liver， and lungs that can lead to catastrophic bleeding complica-tions or shunting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【35】In our case， the AVMs were most likely congenital，considering age of onset and the additional inherited anomaly. We believe this is the first ICA case reported in the United States that is associated with jejunal AVM bleeding. These are clearly late microvascular complications without any other cardiovascular defects， which rules out Ivemark syndrome. HHT may be con-sidered as a differential diagnosis for our case. However， our pa-tient was adopted， with no other stigmata of HHT at this time， except for jejunal AVMs， which are typically not seen in HHT.\n\n【36】This prompted our comprehensive literature search of adult ICA cases that presented with complications other than those related to infection. Eighteen adult cases of ICA were identi-fied and analyzed since the first report of Myerson and Koelle in 1956  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【37】Eleven of the 18 reported cases were sporadic and the remain-ing were familial. Familial cases are generally asymptomatic and usually diagnosed after a close family member/child suf-fers a life-threatening or fatal infection secondary to congeni-tal asplenia. Associated findings included thrombocytosis， mes-enteric vein thrombosis， chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension， and pneumococcal sepsis . Seven adult patients with ICA had invasive bacterial infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，10-15\\]</u>. In addition， there were 5 adult cases of ICA with thrombocyto-sis but no infectious events were found 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16-19\\]</u>. Furthermore，\n\n【38】References：\n\n【39】1\\.

CMV virus has an incubation period of about 4 to 6 weeks. Symptoms of CMV infection vary and depend on factors in-cluding the age and immune status of the patient. It usually presents as asymptomatic infection in immuno-competent individuals whereas severe disease is usually seen in immunocompromised patients. Here we pres-ent a case of an immunocompetent patient who presented with acute CMV hepatitis.\n\n【15】Case Report：\n\n【16】A 35-year-old male with no significant prior medical history who presented to the Emergency Department with a 2-week history of low-grade fever. Acute CMV infection was diagnosed by positive CMV antibody and poly-merase chain reaction (PCR) testing. The patient was treated with valganciclovir that resulted in rapid improve-ment in clinical status as well as normalization of the liver enzymes.\n\n【17】Conclusions：\n\n【18】This article presents a rare case of immunocompetent young male with acute CMV hepatitis who responded favorably to antiviral therapy.\n\n【19】MeSH Keywords： Cytomegalovirus Infections · Hepatitis · Immunocompetence\n\n【20】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/925495\n\n【21】1394 2 山可甘 18\n\n【22】Cytomegalovirus (CMV)， also known as human herpes virus 5， was first isolated in 1956. The name of this virus is derived from the fact that it causes enlargement of the infected cell resulting in the characteristic inclusion bodies seen on mi-croscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Symptoms of CMV infection vary and depend on factors including the age and immune status of the patient.

Infections with CMV are not rare and worldwide seroprevalence for CMV ranges from60% to 100% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. CMV remains latent in the body in most cases， however， in immunosuppressed individuals， CMV can present with severe disease involving multiple organs resulting most commonly in esophagitis or colitis， but also pneumonia， encephalitis， retinitis， myocarditis， hemolytic anemia， and por-tal vein thrombosis. In immunocompetent individuals， it usu-ally follows an asymptomatic course or presents with a mono-nucleosis-like syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-6\\]</u>. There have been sporadic case reports of acute hepatitis in immunocompetent patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，7\\]</u>.\n\n【23】We present a case of young immunocompetent male who pre-sented with acute hepatitis due to CMV infection.\n\n【24】Case Report\n\n【25】Our patient was a 35-year-old male with no significant prior medical history who presented to the Emergency Department with a 2-week history of low-grade fever. Fever pattern was de-scribed as irregular without any diurnal variation and ranged from 38.3℃ (100.9°F) to 39.4℃ (103°F). The patient reported subjective chills and rigors which were partially relieved with the use of acetaminophen. The night before admission， his temperature was 39.4℃ (103F) with chills， profuse diaphore-sis， and mild generalized muscle pain after the fever episode. Patient also reported an episode of mild dull right upper quad-rant abdominal pain which lasted 2 hours and self-resolved. He had mild coughing at night and had used azithromycin a month earlier for a sore throat and upper respiratory symp-toms. Travel history was significant for a trip to Miami with-in the last month. Of note， the patient's son was diagnosed with Roseola infection 3 weeks prior to his presentation. Our patient reported allergies to seafood with which he develops itchy rash. Family history was significant for hypertension in father， and breast cancer and diabetes mellitus in mother. He lived with his family and worked as a physician. He denied tobacco use or use of illicit drugs but acknowledged that he drinks alcohol socially， about 1 to 2 beers a month.\n\n【26】At the time of presentation， the patient had a temperature of37.2℃ (99°F)， heart rate 88 beats per minute， blood pressure\n\n【27】120/80 mmHg and respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. On physical examination there was no rash， jaundice， or pal-pable cervical lymphadenopathy. There was no hepatospleno-megaly or abdominal tenderness. Laboratory tests  re-vealed normal metabolic panel， renal function， and complete blood count except for mild leukocytosis (11.5 k/uL). Liver function test (LFTs) showed alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of335 unit/L (range， 5-40 unit/L)， aspartate aminotransferase(AST) of 160 unit/L (range，9-48 unit/L)， alkaline phosphatase(ALKP) of 254 unit/L (range，53-128 unit/L) and gamma glu-tamyl transferase (GGT) of 430 unit/L of (range， 8-54 unit/L). Bilirubin and serum protein levels were normal. Urinalysis re-vealed pH of 8.0 (range， 6.0-8.0)， specific gravity of 1.020(range， 1.005-1.030)， small bilirubin and was negative for pro-tein， blood， nitrite， and leukocyte esterase. Abdomen ultrasound showed mild splenomegaly but unremarkable liver. Computed tomography of the abdomen was negative for any abdominal pathology or hepatosplenomegaly. Initial differentials included drug induced liver injury from recent use of azithromycin and infectious hepatitis. Patient was started on ceftriaxone and doxycycline pending testing for leptospirosis and anaplasmo-sis. Serologic workup  was negative for acute hepati-tis A， B， and C， Leptospira DNA， Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA PCR， human T-lymphotropic virus type (HLTV)-I and HLTV-II antibody. Serum drug screen for acetaminophen and autoim-mune workup was also negative. On Day 3 the patients LFTs continued to rise with ALT of 495 unit/L (range， 5-40 unit/L)， aspartate AST of 233 unit/L (range， 9-48 unit/L)， and ALKP of299 unit/L (range， 53-128 unit/L). Serologic studies for CMV revealed IgM levels of >240.00 U/mL (range， <30.00 U/mL)， IgG levels of 2.0 U/mL(range，<0.60)， and CMV DNA PCR levels of18353 IU/mL (range，<200 IU/mL). The patient was diagnosed with acute CMV hepatitis and he was started on treatment with valganciclovir on Day 3. Thereafter， the patient improved symptomatically with abatement of fever as well as decline in transaminitis. Given this improvement， a liver biopsy was not pursued. The patient was discharged on Day 6 of his hospi-talization. He later followed up in the clinic where his liveren-zymes continued to resolve to within normal limits.\n\n【28】Discussion\n\n【29】In a survey done on the United States of the general population aged 12 to 49 years old， the rate of CMV infection was 1.6 per100 susceptible persons per year and approximately 27 000new CMV infections occurred among seronegative pregnant women every year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In immunocompetent patients， severe CMV infection can involve almost any organ system， with the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) the most common site followed by the central nervous system (CNS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9-11\\]</u>. The most common GIT manifestations include gastroenteritis， enteritis， colitis， and proctitis. CNS involvement can lead to serious conditions such\n\n|  | Day 1  | Day 3 (peak levels)  | Day 6 (discharge day)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hemoglobin (range 12.0-16.0 g/dL)  | 12.4  | 12.5  | 12.5  |\n| White blood count (range 4.8-10/8k/uL)  | 11.5  | 14.4  | 11.5  |\n| Platelet count (range 150-400 k/uL)  | 162  | 210  | 253  |\n| Serum sodium (range 135-145 mEg/L)  | 140  | 143  | 137  |\n| Serum bicarbonate (Range 24-30 mEq/L)  | 23  | 22  | 29  |\n| Blood urea nitrogen (range 8-26 mg/dL)  | 7  | 4  | 7  |\n| Creatinine， serum (range 0.5-1.5 mg/dL)  | 0.9  | 0.8  | 0.8  |\n| Protein， serum (g/dL) (range 6.0-8.5 g/dL)  | 6.5  | 6.7  | 6.5  |\n| Albumin， serum (g/dL) (range 3.4-4.8g/dL)  | 3.5  | 3.4  | 3.3  |\n| Alanine aminotransferases (range 5-40 unit/L)  | 335  | 495  | 229  |\n| Aspartate aminotransferase (range 9-48 unit/L)  | 160  | 233  | 57  |\n| Alkaline phosphatase (range 53-128 unit/L)  | 254  | 299  | 229  |\n| Total bilirubin (range 0.2-1.2 mg/dL)  | 0.7  | 0.6  | 0.4  |\n| Direct bilirubin (range 0-0.3 mg/dL)  | 0.4  | 0.4  | 0.2  |\n\n【31】as meningoencephalitis， myelitis， and meningoradiculopathy. Thrombosis of the vascular system is another common pre-sentation of CMV infection in immunocompetent hosts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> and data shows that CMV virus directly invades the endothe-lial cells and causes membrane alterations and promotes co agulation. Studies have also linked CMV virus with overexpres-sion of the platelet-derived growth factor， and transforming growth factor-p， which can lead to cell wall proliferation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Ocular and pulmonary involvements are less common in im-munocompetent patients.\n\n【32】In a patient presenting with significant transaminitis and pa-rameters of cholestasis but without elevated bilirubin， a clini-cian must rule out other causes of acute hepatitis. As liver is responsible for concentrating and metabolizing most drugs， it also becomes a main target for drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Diagnosis usually relies on quickly establishing the temporal relationship with the offending agent and stopping it， which leads to resolution of most cases of DILI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Other condi-tions that can cause hepatitis include autoimmune conditions such as primary biliary cirrhosis， non-alcoholic steatotic hep-atitis， and hemochromatosis or infectious etiologies such as those from hepatitis A， B， and C， which are some of the com-mon differential diagnoses. Other less common etiologies in-clude Wilson disease， Budd-Chairi syndrome， ischemic hepa-titis， congestive hepatopathy， and muscle disorders.\n\n【33】Steroid use， recent blood transfusion， sepsis， and acute respira-tory distress syndrome have been suggested as few of the risk factors for CMV disease in immunocompetent patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，16\\]</u>. However， none of these risk factors were present in our patient. Our patient also had normal CD4 count suggesting preserved cell-mediated immunity which is normally involved in protec-tion against CMV reactivation. It is possible that more risk fac tors existed， which could trigger or facilitate CMV reactivation\n\n【34】References：\n\n【35】1\\.

Most patients present with mild mononucleosis-like syndrome with abnormal liver enzymes， with or without slight elevation in serum ALKP and bilirubin levels. Liver enzymes usually do not exceed 5 times the nor-mal limit and are self-limiting in most cases and do not require any treatment.

Surgical removal of the fron-tal sinus osteomas is done in large tumours and in patients with frontal headache， vague changes in personality and neurological deficits being the most common symptoms.

They occur mainly in frontal and ethmoid sinuses in close neighbourhood of the nasofrontal duct 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， localised mostly on cranial sutures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， being the most frequent bone tumours of the facial region通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>. They often remain asymptomatic and tend to be an incidental finding on radiographic studies通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4，7\\]</u>. Some osteomas become symptomatic in the second to fifth decade in life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> as their mean growth rate is 1.61 mm/year， range 0.44 to 6.0 mm/year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， with frontal headache in most cases not related to the size of the lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> and epistaxis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9， 10\\]</u> being the most common symptoms of tumours limited to the sinus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Deterioration in conscious state， vague or subtle changes in personality and new neurologi-cal deficits (seizure， lethargy， global dysphasia and unilateral hemiparesis) occur in patients with in-tracranial extension of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10， 11\\]</u>. Surgical removal of the frontal sinus osteomas is done in symptomatic patients. Asymptomatic lesions can be managed conservatively or submitted to surgery in spite of their location or extension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Large tumours always require surgical treatment as they may cause complications that can result from fron-tal sinusitis caused by nasofrontal duct obstruction通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> with subsequent purulent meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， frontal brain abscess 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，10，12\\]</u>， and intracranial mucocele通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，13，14\\]</u>.

If operation is indicated， computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance (MR) analysis for surgical purpose and strategy is neces-sary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，7，9，10\\]</u>. MR imaging plays an important role in differentiating tumours from inflammatory diseases and serves as a problem-solving tool. High-resolution CT imaging is the preferred modality for evaluation of coexisting sinus inflammatory disease通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Surgical approaches to frontal osteomas can be divided into external， endoscopic drill-out and combined endoscopic and external procedures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> and their choice depends on the size of the lesion， its location and personal experience of the surgeon. Gungor et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> performed a bicoronal incision and removed the tumour through orbitocranial approach. Johnson et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> and Summers et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> performed frontal craniotomy to remove os-teomas with intracranial complications. Chang et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u> operated their patients by a craniofacial ap-proach. Bourgeois et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> removed 2 complicated osteomas using frontobasal craniotomy. Fobe et al.\n\n【26】通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> performed coronal and supraciliar approaches depending on the size of the lesions. The latter pro-cedure is restricted to tumours encroaching on the ethmoid region. External frontoethmoidal approach and osteoplastic frontal sinusectomy are associated with high recurrence rate of tumours located in the posterior table of the frontal sinus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. CO，laser was used in selected cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Endonasal surgery has recently been considered a valuable contribu-tion in the management of paranasal sinus osteomas通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19，22\\]</u>. Selva et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u> performed a combined en-doscopic and orbital approach， with the assistance of stereotactic localisation. Koivunen et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>re-moved osteomas endoscopically. Al-Sebeih et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u> performed bifrontal endoscopic resection of frontal osteomas. Schick et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u> used endonasal approach or osteoplastic frontal sinus approach with coronal incision， depending on the size of the lesion. After the classical osteoplastic frontal sinus surgery the frontal and ethmoid sinuses are usually filled with fat tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> or ionomer cement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Stennert 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> performed widely patent nasofrontal communication epithelialized with free mucosal grafts and fixed with fibrin glue. Schick et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u> reconstructed the re-moved anterior-frontal sinus wall by autologous outer table grafts harvested from the parietal region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Constantinidis et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u> performed cranialization of the frontal sinus in case of a large osteoma with the posterior frontal sinus wall destruction. Frontal sinus was exposed through a coronal incision， the mucosa and the posterior wall were completely removed and the frontal sinus obliterated with fat tissue. The anterior sinus wall was replaced after obliteration of the sinus or reconstructed with calvarian bone transplants \\[26，271. After endoscopic removal of the osteoma obliteration of the frontal sinus does not seem to be necessary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Although small frontal and frontoethmoidal lesions are relatively frequent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7，9，14，23，27\\]</u>， a search of the literature reveals only several case reports of giant osteomas that are very rare findings in that region通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，23，28，29\\]</u>.

The left nasofrontal duct was dilated with a drill under endoscopic guidance. No sinus obliteration was performed. Pathology revealed bony tumour consistent with osteoma. The patient's postopera-tive course was uneventful. She is now doing well without recurrence for 5 months. Her preoperative complaints resolved completely.\n\n【35】DISCUSSION\n\n【36】External approach to frontal osteomas is generally indicated in large tumours， osteomas encroaching on both sinuses and/or the neighbouring structures and in lesions growing in the inner table of the sinus通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，6，9，10，11\\]</u>. Endoscopic drill-out procedures are performed in small tumours limited to the ostial region， restricted to one sinus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19，22\\]</u>. Combined endoscopic and external procedures can ensure radical removal of giant tumours， giving possibility of optimal endonasal approach to the ostial region with minimal cosmetic defect and performing widely Datent nasofrontal communication.\n\n【37】The patient's headaches resulted from pushing out the sinus tables by the osteoma and partial obstruc tion of the left frontal sinus ostium. As the tumour grew in the floor of the frontal sinus， after its removal the mucous membrane lining the remaining tables of the sinus was unchanged. Therefore， no obliteration was performed in order to preserve normal function of the mucous membrane. Left endoscopic ethmoid-ectomy was performed and the mucous membrane around the left sinus ostium removed in order to prevent future ostial obstruction. As there was no\n\n【38】evidence of any pathology of the right frontal ostium， no surgery in that region was performed. Combined external and endoscopic procedures have been suc-cessfully used in frontal sinus surgery.

Staphylococcus aureus，\n\n【32】Haemophilus influenzae， and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have\n\n【33】been the main pathogens in the respiratory tracts of cystic fi brosis patients， but recently other potentially pathogenic bac-teria， such as Achromobacter xylosoxidans， have emerged 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. A. xylosoxidans is an aerobic， motile， Gram-negative rod that can be found in aquatic environments， as well as in the human respiratory and gastro-intestinal tract and the ear canal. It was\n\n【34】previously known as Alcaligenes dentrificans subspecies xylosox-idans and Aicaligenes xylosoxidans subspecies xylosoxidans， and\n\n【35】was first described in 1971 by Yabuuchi and Ohyama， who dis-covered it in patients with chronic， purulent otitis media 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【36】A. xylosoxidans is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause se-vere infections， especially in immunocompromised patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. It has been found in neonates and in patients with cancer， neu-tropenia， diabetes mellitus， renal failure， HIV infection， IgM deficiency， and in bone marrow or liver transplant patients. A number of case reports have described infections with A. xy-losoxodans in patients with non-CF-bronchiectasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Clinical syndromes， such as bacteremia， meningitis， pneumonia， os-teomyelitis， urinary tract infections， prosthetic valve endocar-ditis， and peritonitis have been described in infected patients， the most common symptoms of which are primary bactere-mia and bacteremia related to an intravenous catheter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Malignancies， central venous catheter implants， and previous major surgery are the most common predisposing conditions. Patients with A. xylosoxidans bacteremia frequently present with fever， sepsis syndrome， respiratory complaints， hypoten-sion， and altered consciousness. Abdominal pain， oliguria， and diarrhea can also be found. In a study with neonates， throm-bocytopenia， neutropenia， abdominal distension， and apnea were the most common clinical features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，5\\]</u>.\n\n【37】We describe a case of septic shock caused by A. xylosoxidans in a 10-year-old child with cystic fibrosis and severe lung disease.\n\n【38】Case Report\n\n【39】A 10-year-old girl was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis in the neonatal period after presenting with meconium ileus. She was homozygous for F508del mutation and had severe lung disease. Her current “forced expiratory volume in 1 second\"(FEV1) ranged between 33-38% predicted， and her lung func-tion further showed severe obstruction with increased airway resistance and hyperinflation. A recent CT scan revealed cys-tic bronchiectasis in the apical and basal regions and a per-sistent atelectasis of the right middle lobe.\n\n【40】In March 2010， a multi-resistant A. xylosoxidans (with multi-re-sistance defined as resistance against all agents in at least two of the following antibiotic classes： B-lactams， quinolones， or aminoglycosides) was cultured for the first time from her spu-tum. Since April 2013 she had been chronically colonized with this pathogen. In addition， Staphylococcus aureus grew inter-mittently from her sputum samples. Her maintenance thera-py included azithromycin， nebulized hypertonic saline， dornase alfa， pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy， and fat-soluble vitamins. Nebulized ceftazidime twice daily was used as sup-pressive antibiotic therapy for the airway colonization with A. xylosoxidans. Cyclic intravenous antibiotic therapy with com-binations of amikacin and either meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam was administered approximately every eight weeks to maintain a stable clinical situation. During several months per year， she was admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation cen-ter to maximize therapeutic possibilities. She was on chronic oxygen therapy because of episodes of desaturation at mini-mal exercise， and required non-invasive ventilation (NIV) dur-ing sleep. She received enteral tube feeding because of chronic anorexia and feeding difficulties. She remained in a relative-ly stable condition with regular admissions to the rehabilita-tion center and regular intravenous (V) treatment courses.\n\n【41】In April 2014， she was admitted to our hospital a few days prior to her scheduled IV treatment because of malaise， not tolerating enteral feeding， vomiting， and a deteriorated respi-ratory condition. Spirometry showed a FEV1 of 28% predict-ed. Her oxygen need increased， as well as the need for NV. I treatment with meropenem and colistin was started. Total parenteral nutrition was temporarily initiated. She developed refeeding syndrome with hypophosphatemia and mild hypo-calcemia， which resolved after adequate supplementation. Two days after her admission to the hospital， she developed a fever and her levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) increased to a maxi-mum of 60 mg/L. Multi-resistant A. xylosoxidans was cultured from her sputum sample. Cultures for viruses，Mycoplasma spp. and Mycobacteria spp. were negative. Because of her persis-tent fever， flucloxacillin was added to her therapy， although a culture at time of admission for S. aureus was negative. She improved clinically， and enteral feeding was gradually rein-troduced. Erythromycin was added because of delayed gas-tric emptying. She was discharged from the hospital after two weeks， with Ⅳ treatment continuing at home.\n\n【42】However， only a few days after discharge， she was readmitted because of fever， severe respiratory deterioration， and hypoten-sion， a picture consistent with septic shock. Admission to the pe-diatric intensive care unit (PICU) was necessary because of the need for fluid resuscitation and continuous NⅣ. Antibiotics were switched to high-dose piperacillin-tazobactam， based on a recent sputum culture displaying intermediate sensitivity of A. xylosox-idans to this antibiotic . After consulting the infectious\n\n| Antibiotic  | Sensitivity  | MIC (ug/mL)  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Piperacillin-tazobactam  |  | \\>256  |\n| Ceftazidime  | R  | \\>256  |\n| Meropenem  | R  | \\>32  |\n| Ciprofloxacin  | R  | \\>32  |\n| Polymyxins  | R  | 12  |\n| Ticarcillin  | R  | Not available\\  |\n| Aztreonam  | R  | Not available\\  |\n| Fosfomycin  | R  | Not available\\  |\n| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole  | R  | Not available\\  |\n\n【44】\\ MIC values could not be calculated for all antibiotics.\n\n【45】diseases specialist， high-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was added， while high-dose colistin was continued. Her initial fever persisted and CRP levels continued to rise， but both start-ed to recover after two days. At that time， blood cultures taken at time of admission were reported to be positive for A. xyiosoxi-dans. Antibiotic treatment remained unchanged because of clin-ical and biochemical improvement. Consecutive blood cultures taken after initiation of the antibiotic therapy were negative.\n\n【46】The patient was transferred to the pediatric ward， and after two weeks she again experienced intermittent fever with in-creasing CRP levels and an increased need for oxygen and NIV. A. xylosoxidans was the only microorganism cultured from her sputum sample， and her blood cultures remained negative. Eventually readmission to the PICU was necessary， where an-tibiotic treatment was switched to a combination of thiam-fenicol， imipenem， and colistin， because of in vitro suscepti-bility for imipenem， and because thiamfenicol had been used with success in a similar case in another hospital. This re sulted in a gradual clinical improvement with decreased oxy-gen need， weaning of NlV， and increasing FEV1 values up to34%. Several repeat blood cultures remained sterile. She re-ceived this combination of antibiotics for four weeks and was then discharged home in combination with intensive rehabil-itation at a specialized treatment center. Several weeks after discharge， she was readmitted to the PICU because of vomit-ing， intolerance to enteral feeding (again)， and a subsequent worsening respiratory condition. Because of this and the need of repetitive hospital admissions with minimal improvement， she was referred for a lung transplant to another care center.\n\n【47】Discussion\n\n【48】Knowledge about infections caused by A. xylosoxidans in pa-tients with cystic fibrosis is relatively scarce. As far as we\n\n【49】know， this case is the first case of a proven bloodstream in-fection caused by A. xylosoxidans in a cystic fibrosis patient. A. xylosoxidans is being isolated with increasing frequency in the sputum of cystic fibrosis patients all over the world 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry reported an increased prevalence， with a rate of 6.2% in 2011 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.The Belgium Cystic Fibrosis Registry of 2013 reported a prevalence as high as 10.5%， which was significantly higher than the 7.5%reported in 2010. The prevalence of chronic colonization with A. xylosoxidans has increased as well， from 2.9% in 2010 to6.3% in 2013 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. This prevalence may be underestimated，as the micro-organism is sometimes difficult to identify. Bacterial misidentification as atypical P. aeruginosa has occurred with standard phenotypic identification methods； misidentification presents a challenge to effective infection control， to antimi-crobial therapy， and to prognosis in cystic fibrosis patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【50】The clinical relevance of A. xylosoxidans in cystic fibrosis pa-tients remains uncertain. De Baets et al. found that patients with a first positive sputum culture for A. xylosoxidans had significantly lower Bhalla scores 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> on HRCT， lower Brasfield scores 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> on chest x-rays， and lower， although not signifi-cant， forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV1 values. These find-ings， combined with the results of Tan et al.， who could not de-tect a need for more intravenous antibiotic treatment courses. led to the hypothesis that A. xylosoxidans is a colonizer of se-verely damaged lungs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，12\\]</u>. In their study， Tan et al. also re-ported no significant difference in the change in lung function over four years， Northern chest x-ray score 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>， Schachman-Kulczycki score 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>， or nutritional status. However， Hansen et al. reported a significant difference in FEV1 and FVC values in patients before and after chronic infection. Furthermore， they reported a significantly faster deterioration in FEV1 and FVC values in patients with rapidly increasing antibody lev-els 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Another study reported a higher prevalence of A. xy-losoxidans in patients awaiting lung transplantation than in\n\n【51】the general cystic fibrosis population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Our case study could be another illustration of a clear pathogenic role of this organism in cystic fibrosis patients. Although the lungs were the probable source of the septicemia in our case study， our patient also had an implanted venous access device present. Repeated cultures from this port， however， remained negative.\n\n【52】Patient-to-patient transmission has been described by others and is another reason why A.xylosoxidans infection should be feared. Vu-thien et al. and Tan et al. excluded the possi-bility of interpatient transmission， whereas several other au-thors found that some of their patients harbored the same strain， indicating cross-infection or infection through a com-mon source 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，6，11，12，16\\]</u>.\n\n【53】Finally， because of its inherent and acquired resistance to sev-eral antibiotics， there is a lack of good therapeutic options to eradicate A. xylosoxidans. In one study， Lambiase et al. found that 20% of A. xylosoxidans isolates showed a multidrug-resis-tant profile， with resistance to aztreonam， cephalosporins (in-cluding cefepime， ceftazidime， and cefotaxime)， carbapenems， aminoglycosides， quinolones， and trimethoprim-sulfamethox-azole. These same isolates were sensitive to piperacillin and piperacillin-tazobactam. Moreover， the study indicated that A. xylosoxidans isolates could be resistant to many antibiotics， re-gardless of the study population， as isolates that were recov-ered from non-cystic-fibrosis patients also showed resistance to ceftazidime，carbapenems， and levofloxacin. Trancassini et al. also discovered a high frequency of resistance to aztreo-nam， gentamicin， amikacin， tobramycin， cefepime， and cipro-floxacin in their study population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Saiman et al. found that minocycline， imipenem， meropenem， and piperacillin with or without tazobactam showed the highest antibacterial activity. They also discovered that a minority of their A. xylosoxidans\n\n【54】References：\n\n【55】1\\.

Furthermore， synergistic activity was noted for combinations of chloramphenicol with minocycline， for cipro-floxacin with imipenem， and for ciprofloxacin with meropen-em 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Increasing evidence of resistance to aminoglycosides， cephalosporins and most of the p-lactam antibiotics， and the variable susceptibility to fluoroquinolones， makes antipseu-domonal penicillins and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole the preferred agents in treatment. In our case study， the isolate recovered from sputum samples was multi-resistant， showing resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam， ceftazidime， meropen-em， ciprofloxacin，and polymyxins on multiple occasions. Our patient received nebulized ceftazidime twice daily as a mainte-nance therapy， although resistance to this antimicrobial agent had already been documented. The therapeutic combination strategy with imipenem， thiamfenicol， and high-dose colistin eventually lead to a clinical improvement.\n\n【64】Conclusions\n\n【65】To our knowledge， the case we presented is the first case of a proven A. xylosoxidans septicemia in a cystic fibrosis pa-tient with severe lung disease. This case supports the clinical importance of A. xylosoxidans infection in cystic fibrosis pa-tients. As its prevalence is rising and patient-to-patient trans-mission is highly probable， further studies are warranted to determine its role and to document the appropriate treat-ment strategy for eradication and long-term treatment strat-egies of this organism.\n\n【66】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of interests</u>\n\n【67】通用结尾删除-1:<u>None.</u>\n\n【68】通用结尾删除-1:<u>8\\.

Stenosis after TORS in OSAS patients is rarely described and no literature review has inves-tigated this dramatic untoward event.\n\n【21】Case Report： We report on a case of severe recalcitrant oropharyngeal stenosis after multilevel surgery with transoral robot-ic tongue base resection in an OSAS patient， leading to tracheotomy and gastrostomy dependence. Following the failure of numerous conservative therapeutic attempts， oropharyngeal patency was restored after exten-sive scar tissue removal through an open-neck approach， followed by a pharyngeal reconstruction with radial forearm free flap (RFFF).\n\n【22】Conclusions： Recalcitrant oropharyngeal stenosis is a dramatic complication that must be considered in OSAS patients sub-mitted to TORS in a multilevel strategy and that is rarely described in the literature. A thorough review of the existing literature is presented to assess which factors are involved and the therapeutic strategies invoked in this scenario. The adoption of resection tools suited for robot-assisted surgery and the staging of TORS in case of multilevel surgery could decrease the risk of extensive scar formation. To date there is still no broad con-sensus on which therapeutic choice is the best for recalcitrant oropharyngeal stenosis. When minimally inva-sive treatments fail， a wide scar resection with a RFFF oropharyngeal reconstruction could be considered as a valuable option to restore the upper aerodigestive tract patency.\n\n【23】Keywords： Oropharynx· Robotic Surgical Procedures · Sleep Apnea， Obstructive· Surgical Flaps\n\n【24】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/937123\n\n【25】￥o1636 盟2 山可8 33\n\n【26】Currently， transoral robotic surgery (TORS) is an effective and safe option for adults and pediatrics patients suffering from obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS)  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. A recent review and meta-analysis have shown TORS to have a low rate of complications， which mainly include transient dys-phagia (7.2%)， bleeding (4.2%)， and postoperative pharynge-al oedema (1%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Stenosis after OSAS surgery is rarely de scribed and no review of the literature has investigated this dramatic untoward event. The following is a report of a case of severe recalcitrant oropharyngeal stenosis requiring trache-otomy and gastrostomy dependence after TORS was used as part of a multilevel surgical approach for OSAS. A thorough review of the existing literature is presented to assess which factors are involved in the development of oropharyngeal ste-nosis in OSAS patients after TORS and which therapeutic strat-egies are invoked.\n\n【27】Case Report\n\n【28】A 54-year-old micrognathic White male with OSAS underwent uvulopalatoplasty and transoral robotic tongue base resection. Unfortunately， since the surgery was performed in another hos-pital， we did not have a record of that surgery. The emergence of postoperative dyspnea and dysphagia due to the develop-ment of a concentric oropharyngeal stenosis led the patient to undergo tracheostomy， TORS plasty of the concentric scar tissue， and reconstruction with a buccal myomucosal graft. After the failure of these previous treatments， the patient re-quired a laparoscopic gastrostomy and was admitted to our hospital. An upper airways endoscopy  and a neck CT scan  showed a subtotal concentric oropharyn-geal stenosis， with a 10-mm craniocaudal extent. The patient underwent a transoral scar resection and a pharyngeal plasty\n\n【29】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2.

Ten days later， the endoscopic control showed the recurrence of scarring tis-sue， which led to a complete stenosis of the pharyngeal lu-men. This happened despite the use of post-surgical medication with mitomycin-c. Considering the failure of all the previous conservative therapeutic attempts， we opted for an exten-sive scar tissue removal through an open-neck approach， fol-lowed by pharyngeal reconstruction with radial forearm free\n\n【35】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 6.

The scar resection was done by removing the lateral and posterior walls of the oropharynx and exposing the prevertebral fascia. The RFFF was harvested according to Soutar and positioned to reconstruct the pharyngeal defect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Termino-terminal microvascular surgical anastomosis was con-ducted between the radial artery and the superior thyroid ar-tery and between the comitant vein and the superior thyroid vein . The salivary stent was then repositioned. On the 21$ postoperative day， after removing the salivary stent， the patient underwent a steroid injection in the granulation tissue between the mucosa and the radial free flap. This pro-cedure was repeated 3 times. Because of the persistence of granulation tissue， in the following months we performed 4CO， laser vaporization procedures， 6 stricture dilations using a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube， and 11 topical mitomycin-C ap-plications to the neopharyngealwall.\n\n【37】Finally， the patient recovered an adequate oropharyngeal pa-tency and underwent tracheostomy and gastrostomy closure.\n\n【38】Discussion\n\n【39】Oropharyngeal stenosis is life-threatening， but fortunately is rare. We have reported a case of severe and relapsing steno-sis of the oropharynx as a consequence of TORS as part of a multilevel surgical approach for OSAS. We searched for similar reports in the literature and found only a few records of post-operative stenosis following robotic surgery， performed either alone and as part of a multilevel surgery. Our review of the ex-isting literature  revealed a total of 6 cases of partial or complete stenosis after TORS in OSAS patients and only 1case in TORS for oropharyngeal cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，5-7\\]</u>.

Overall， 9 cases of postoperative oropharyngeal stenosis have been reported in the literature. Out of these 9 cases， OSAS was the surgical enrolment criterion in 8 cases (88.9%)， TORS was part of the surgical strategy in 7 cases (77.8%)， and ste-nosis was associated to multilevel surgery in 7 cases (77.8%). Due to the rarity of this complication， it is not easy to draw conclusions from such a small number of cases； however， we may suppose that the cause of postoperative oropharyngeal stenosis lies in the 2 following conditions： extensive scarring and the type of patient. Extensive scarring is a consequence of both the TORS procedure and the multilevel surgery. TORS is usually performed with a monopolar cautery， and the amount of heat dissipated by the alternate electric current causes sig-nificant collateral damage to adjacent tissues and undesired effects on wound healing. Several studies have shown that monopolary cautery is associated with postoperative scar con-tracture and wound healing delay \\[10-12non-compliant with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP\\]. Multilevel surgery also contributes to extensive scar formation， involving mu tiple and adjacent anatomical sites. OSAS patients typically have a reduced pharyngeal airway space and possible associated mi-crognathia. These factors contribute to the narrowing of the posterior airway space， which may lead to narrowing of the scarring tissue consequent to surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【45】The association between OSAS and patient' morphology has caused a growing interest in the analysis of airway shape and dimension. In particular， there is recent evidence about the potential role of 3D imaging digital technology to identify al-teration of the upper airway anatomy for better therapeutic planning 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，15\\]</u>. Some authors reported that surgical tech-niques applied to narrow spaces can incite inflammation and injure the mucosa beyond the treated area \\[5，16a potential complication of multilevel， single-stage upper airway surgery involving lingual tonsillectomy in children， and to discuss the manner in which OPS may be managed successfully.

INTERVENTION Multilevel， single-stage upper airway surgery， including lingual tonsillectomy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Development of OPS noted during office or intraoperative ex-amination. RESULTS Forty-nine of 104 patients underwent mul-tilevel， single-stage upper airway procedures that included lin-gual tonsillectomy. Four of these 49 patients developed OPS， for a complication rate of 8.2%. Three patients required pha-ryngoplasty (scar release， debulking of fibrotic tissue， and re-orientation of the scar\\]. In the case report described here， all of these potential risk factors for postoperative oropharyngeal stenosis were present.\n\n【47】Regarding the management of the postoperative oropha-ryngeal stenosis， many different procedures have been de-scribed  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-8，16-20\\]</u>. However， the majority can be applied only in case of mild stenosis (stenosis dilation， intral-esional steroids， minor scar tissue lysis). Flap reconstruction is a feasible alternative when a wide resection is needed to treat an oropharyngeal stenosis. Local flaps， such as buccal muco-sal or facial artery musculomucosal flap， are the first available options in case of small-to-moderate-sized defects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21-24\\]</u>. Larger defects require regional myocutaneous pedicled flaps or microvascular tissue transfer， which are all excellent op-tions for wide oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal reconstruc-tion. Among these， fasciocutaneous free flaps， because of their flexibility and reliability， are a valid option in reconstructing tubular structures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. In our report， due to the failure of all the previous attempts to restore the pharyngeal patency， we planned an extensive scar tissue removal and a reconstruction with the RFFF. RFFF is the criterion standard method in oro-pharyngeal reconstructive head and neck cancer surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u> and is described also in oral cavity and oesophagus reconstruc-tion after caustic injuries and burns contractures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27，28\\]</u>. The thin， pliable， predominantly hairless skin of the RFFF made it suitable to our purpose and led to a good aesthetic outcome. The main limits of this type of flap are： the possibility of do-nor-site complications， the risk of fistula at the mucosa-skin junction， and vascular complications of the pedicle (thrombo-sis and/or ischemia). None of these complications occurred in\n\n| No. of Authors Previous surgery Treatmentpatients  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Lin et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>  | Single level surgery (11/39 patients) Multilevel surgery (28/39 patients)  | 39  | Minor surgery to lyse the scar tissue + triamcinolone injections  |\n| Muderris et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>  | Multilevel surgery  | 2  | Z-plasty； minor surgery to lyse the scartissue + triamcinolone injections  |\n| Hay et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>  | Single level surgery-oropharyngealtransoral robotic surgery  | 122  | Stenosis dilation  |\n| Santos et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>  | Single level surgery-tonsillectomy  | 2  | Intralesional triamcinolone  |\n| Prager et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>  | Multilevel surgery  | 4  |  |\n| McLaughlin et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>  | Multilevel surgery - adenoidectomy+tonsillectomy  | 5  | Jejunal free flap， pharyngoplasty，intralesional triamcinolone  |\n| Tompkins et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>  | Single level surgery-tonsillectomy  | 1  | Bilateral buccal myomucosal grafts  |\n| Haller et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>  | Multilevel surgery-adenoidectomy+tonsillectomy  | 2  | Sternocleidomastoid myocutaneous flap  |\n| Banerjee et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>  | Multilevel surgery-adenoidectomy+tonsillectomy  | 1  | Tissue expander  |\n\n【49】our case. However， the development of granulation tissue af-ter RFFF pharyngeal reconstruction required postoperative la-ser vaporizations， dilations， topical mitomycin-C， and steroid injections. Pharyngeal stricture after microvascular free flap reconstruction usually occurs at the free flap mucosal anas-tomosis， and the incidence has been reported to range from5% to 22%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>.\n\n【50】Among the various therapeutic options available， mitomycin-c alone or in combination with other treatments (eg， stricture dilation， steroids injection) is suitable as a strong inhibitor of fibroblast proliferation in wound healing processes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30-33\\]</u>. In our report， the combination of these strategies allowed resto-ration of the neopharyngeal patency.\n\n【51】Conclusions\n\n【52】Oropharyngeal stenosis is a rare and dramatic complication that must be considered in OSAS patients submitted to TORS in a multilevel strategy. The adoption of resection tools suit-ed for robot-assisted surgery with a decreased thermal tissue damage may be recommended to prevent untoward events re-lated to the widest coagulation zones.

Moreover， there is still no broad consen-sus on which therapeutic choice is the best for recalcitrant oropharyngeal stenosis.

Vitamin D is important for serotonin synthesis and low serotonin levels are thought to be associated with depression. During the winter， levels of vitamin D are lower， what might precipitate depression symptoms in individuals with SAD， but it might also be relevant for other depressive disorders， such as major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder. Patients with depression may benefit from vitamin D supplements， especially during the late autumn and winter when sunlight-induced vitamin D production is lower， and diet enriched with tryptophan. Vitamin D supplements may be beneficial in depressed patients with high inflammatory biomarkers because studies have shown that inflammation can produce depression in vulnerable individuals by lowering plasma tryptophan and diminishing brain serotonin activity. Vitamin D supplements may also improve the efficacy of SSRIs in these patients.\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a form of recurrent depres-sive or bipolar disorder， with episodes that vary in severity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Patients that suffer from SAD have episodes of major depres-sion that tend to recur during specific times of the year， usually winter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Studies of brain serotonin function support the hy pothesis of disturbed activity. The short-allele polyphorphism for serotonin transporter is more common in patients with SAD than in healthy people 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. About 5% of USA population expe-riences SAD， with symptoms present for about 40% of the year. Light therapy during the autumn and winter can be very useful， but should continue through the end of the winter season until spontaneous remission of symptoms in the spring or summer，\n\n【6】Copyright @ 2021 by the Bulgarian Association of Young Surgeons\n\n【7】DOI： 10.5455/IJMRCR.ThelmportanceofVitaminDinSeasonalAffectiveDisorder\n\n【8】andotherdepressivedisorders\n\n【9】First Received： November 27，2021Accepted： December 26， 2021Associate Editor： Ivan Inkov (BG)；\n\n【10】Corresponding author： Dr Domina Petric； UHC Split， Soltanska 1， Croatia.

Pharmacotherapy (antidepressants) and cognitive behavior therapy are also appropriate treatment options 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【12】The link between vitamin D， serotonin and depression\n\n【13】Serotonin regulates a wide variety of brain functions and behav-iors. Brain serotonin is synthesized from tryptophan by trypto-phan hydroxylase 2， which is transcriptionally activated by vita-min D hormone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Vitamin D hormone (calcitriol) activates the transcription of the serotonin-synthesizing gene tryptophan hy-droxylase 2 (TPH2) in the brain at a vitamin D response element(VDRE) and represses the transcription of TPH1 in tissues out-side the blood-brain barrier at a distinct VDRE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Low vitamin D hormone levels during fetal and neonatal development could result in poor gene tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) expression and subsequently reduced serotonin concentrations in the de veloping brain. The important role of TPH2-mediated serotonin production in shaping brain structure and neural wiring during early neurodevelopment is well known 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. This mechanism suggests that adequate vitamin D hormone levels during preg-nancy， as well as nutritional intake of tryptophan and vitamin D during early childhood， may have a critical influence on brain\n\n【14】serotonin levels and thus， on the structure and neural wiring of the brain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Serotonin hypothesis proposes that diminished activity of serotonin pathways plays a causal role in the patho-physiology of depression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The best evidence that serotonin plays a role in the pathophysiology of depression comes from studies of \"tryptophan depletion\"， where an acute dietary ma-nipulation is employed to produce a transient lowering in brain serotonin activity through diminishing availability of its pre-cursor amino acid， tryptophan. In healthy participants with no risk factors for depression， tryptophan depletion does not pro-duce clinically significant changes in mood； however， recovered depressed patients free of medication can show brief， clinically relevant， depressive symptomatology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Inflammation can pro-duce depression in vulnerable individuals by lowering plasma tryptophan and diminishing brain serotonin activity. Such an effect could explain the diminished efficacy of SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) in depressed patients with high levels of inflammatory biomarkers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Calcitriol is a well-known endocrine regulator of calcium homeostasis. More recently， lo-cal calcitriol production by immune cells was shown to exert autocrine or paracrine immunomodulating effects. Immune cells that produce calcitriol also express the vitamin D receptor(VDR) and the enzymes needed to metabolize vitamin D3 (1&-，25-， and 24-hydroxylases). Studies of animal models and cell cultures showed both direct and indirect immunomodulating effects involving the T cells， B cells， and antigen-presenting cells(dendritic cells and macrophages)； and affecting both innate and adaptive immune responses. The overall effect is a switch from the Th1/Th17 response to the Th2/Treg profile. The im-munomodulating effects of vitamin D may explain the reported epidemiological associations between low vitamin D status and a large number of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Such associations have been suggested by observational studies not only in rheumatoid arthritis，lupus， inflammatory bowel disease， and type 1 diabetes； but also in infections， malignancies，trans-plant rejection， and cardiovascular disease. In animal models for these diseases， vitamin D supplementation has been found to produce therapeutic effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Vitamin D supplements may improve the efficacy of SSRIs in the depressed patients with high levels of inflammatory biomarkers. Patients with autoim-mune and inflammatory diseases who suffer from depression may benefit from vitamin D supplementation as well. Vitamin D is thought to increase the level of brain serotonin and thus， opposes the effect of inflammation， which lowers tryptophan and consequently， serotonin levels， which means that optimal vitamin D status positively correlates with optimal serotonin levels.\n\n【15】Light therapy\n\n【16】Observations from clinical trials have frequently demonstrated that light therapy can be an effective therapy for seasonal and non-seasonal major depression. It is known that light therapy modulates mood states and cognitive functions， involving cir-cadian and non-circadian pathways from retinas into brain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. SAD is prevalent when vitamin D stores are typically low. Broad-spectrum light therapy includes wavelengths between 280-320nm which allow the skin to produce vitamin D 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Analysis of pooled data from randomized trials provides evidence for the ef-ficacy of use of bright light therapy ≥ 5，000 lux for periods ≥30minutes when used as augmentation to standard antidepressant pharmacotherapy in the treatment of major depressive disorder and bipolar depression without a seasonal pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【17】1\\. Sun light (spectrum 280-320 UVB) is important for vitamin D3 production. Clothing and sun protection creams， espe-cially with high sun protection factor (SPF) prevent vitamin D3 production in the skin. Vitamin D deficiency is iden-tified as a world global problem with approximately 14%of the population with inadequate vitamin D levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. During the winter， levels of vitamin D are lower and thus， may precipitate depression symptoms in individuals with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder.\n\n【18】2\\. Broad-spectrum light therapy that includes wavelengths between 280 and 320 nm， which allow the skin to produce vitamin D， is shown to be useful in patients with SAD， but also in patients with major depressive disorder and bipolar depression without a seasonal pattern.\n\n【19】3\\. Low serotonin levels are thought to be associated with de-pression. Serotonin regulates a variety of cognitive func-tions： mood， decision-making， social behavior， excessive worry and impulse control. Vitamin D is important for serotonin synthesis. Brain serotonin is synthesized from tryptophan by tryptophan hydroxylase 2. Tryptophan hy-droxylase is transcriptionally activated by vitamin D hor-mone. Patients with depression may benefit from vitamin D supplements and diet enriched with tryptophan.\n\n【20】4\\. Some studies shown that inflammation can produce depres-sion in vulnerable individuals by lowering plasma tryp-tophan and diminishing brain serotonin activity. Such an effect could explain the diminished efficacy of SSRIs in de-pressed patients with high levels of inflammatory biomark-ers. SSRIs are considered as a first line treatment for major depressive disorder， as well as for seasonal depression. Pa-tients with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases may have poorer clinical outcome with SSRIs therapy. Vitamin D is known for its immunomodulatory effects and thus， vitamin D supplements may be beneficial in depressed pa-tients with high inflammatory biomarkers. Vitamin D sup plements may also improve the efficacy of SSRIs in these patients.\n\n【21】To summarize， it would be rationale to measure levels of vita-min D of every patient that suffers from depression， and to treat vitamin D deficiency if present. Nutritional interventions are very important part of multi-modal therapy for all depressive disorders， which also includes light therapy， pharmacotherapy(antidepressant agents)， cognitive therapy， art therapy work therapy， and spiritual support (for religious individuals). Fur-ther pre-clinical and clinical investigation is mandatory in order to better understand the clinical significance of vitamin D status in the context of SAD and other depressive disorders.\n\n【22】Funding\n\n【23】This work did not receive any grant from funding agencies in the public， commercial， or not-for-profit sectors.\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of interest</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There are no conflicts of interest to declare by any of the authors of this study.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>References</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

However， fulminant liver failure arising from in vitro fertilization (IVF) therapy involving progestogens (e.g.dy-drogesterone) is extremely rare and has not been reported in pregnancy. Furthermore， dydrogesterone-me-diated hepatic dysfunction has not previously necessitated liver transplantation and is usually conservatively managed. We report the first Australian case of a pregnant woman with delayed fulminant liver failure and in utero fetal death requiring a liver transplant from dydrogesterone use.\n\n【12】Case Report： A 35-year-old multiparous (G.P，) woman presented with painless jaundice and transaminitis (alanine amino-transferase and aspartate aminotransferase of 2800 U/L and 2990 U/L respectively). She was pregnant at 14weeks’ gestation after successful IVF in Thailand four months before involving dydrogesterone therapy. She was diagnosed with delayed， subfulminant liver failure arising from previous dydrogesterone use. Initially， she was not encephalopathic and conservative management strategies were instituted. Her hepatic dysfunction progressed and she deteriorated clinically with encephalopathy， necessitating an emergent liver transplanta-tion. Fetal death was confirmed in utero four days before transplantation. A combined orthotopic liver trans-plant and hysterotomy with fetal evacuation were performed without complication.\n\n【13】Conclusions：\n\n【14】Fulminant liver failure in pregnancy due to idiosyncratic drug reactions are rare. Dydrogesterone may cause significant， albeit delayed， liver dysfunction in pregnancy necessitating the need for liver transplantation. Early recognition of progressive liver failure despite best supportive care efforts should prompt early considerations for liver transplantation. Delays in liver transplantation with prolonged hyperbilirubinemia and coagulopathy may exacerbate fetal death in utero.\n\n【15】MeSH Keywords： Dydrogesterone ·Liver Failure， Acute ·Liver Transplantation·Pregnancy\n\n【16】Ful-text PDE https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/925690\n\n【17】Fulminant liver failure represents a rare complication of preg-nancy and is more common during the third trimester 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Half of these cases are attributable to hemolysis， elevated liver en-zymes， low platelets (HELLP) syndrome， and acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>.

A significant proportion of cases are often cryptogenic in their etiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10-16\\]</u>. Acute liver failure occurring during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy are associated with poor fetal outcomes， includ-ing developmental delays， neurological abnormalities， spon-taneous abortions， and neonatal death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-16\\]</u>.

The most frequently implicated agents include acetaminophen， iso-niazid， valproate， phenytoin， and propy.thiouracil 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.

Ofthese，only one case resulted in fetal preservation and delivery of an infant at 37 weeks' gestation with significant neurological morbidi-ty and developmental delay 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Fulminant liver failure arising from in vitro fertilization (IVF) therapies， particularly proges-togens (eg dydrogesterone)， are extremely rare. Multiple trials and reviews have evaluated the safety profile of dydrogester-one use in IVF and have reported minimal adverse side effects(ie nausea， vomiting， dizziness， constipation) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. No large co-hort study or trial to date has shown any hepatic dysfunction arising from dydrogesterone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Only two case reports have associated the use of dydrogesterone with the development of jaundice， acute hepatitis， and in one of these patients， co-morbid autoimmune hemolytic anemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18，19\\]</u>. However， nei-ther patient achieved pregnancy nor required a liver transplant.\n\n【19】We report the first Australian case of a 35-year-old multipa-rous， pregnant woman requiring an emergency liver transplant secondary to dydrogesterone-induced fulminant hepatic fail-ure with associated fetal death. We demonstrate that dydro-gesterone-induced liver failure in pregnancy may be delayed. This case highlights the need for early liver transplantation in progressive drug-induced liver failure despite the best sup-portive care efforts. Furthermore， delays in transplantation that prolong maternal hyperbilirubinemia and coagulopathy may exacerbate fetal death.\n\n【20】A 35-year-old multiparous (G，P，) Australian woman of Indian descent at 14 weeks' gestation， previously fit and well， was admitted to our hepatology service for investigation and man-agement of painless jaundice and elevated transaminases. The patient had reported the onset of scleral jaundice three days before her hospital admission with associated pruritus affect-ing the palms of her hands and soles of her feet. She denied any abdominal， stool， or urinary symptoms. Her past medi-cal history included previous gestational diabetes， an elec-tive termination of pregnancy four years prior， and a left sal-pingectomy one year ago after a previous ectopic pregnancy. She had undergone two previous spontaneous vaginal deliv-eries at term without complication. Her previous term preg-nancies were unremarkable， with no prior history of liver dys-function， eclampsia， HELLP， AFLP， or ICP. She had no history of any underlying liver or gallbladder disease. She did not smoke or drink alcohol. She did not have any tattoos and had no pre-vious blood transfusions.\n\n【21】She had traveled to Thailand approximately four months be-fore her hospital admission for IF therapy. She had received a regular IVF regimen comprising three months' duration of oral dydrogesterone (10 mg)， oral estradiol (1 mg)， and per vagi-nal progesterone. Embryo transfer and implantation was suc-cessful， and she returned to Australia for ongoing antenatal care. She reported only taking routine pregnancy supplements including Ferrograd-C， vitamin B complex， and cholecalciferol while pregnant. She did not use any herbal supplements， an-algesic agents， antibiotics， or over-the-counter medications. On examination， she was hypotensive at 90/60 mmHg， but her other vitals were within normal limits. She was clinically jaundiced with evidence of marked scleral icterus. Peripheral stigmata of chronic liver disease were absent. She had no fea-tures of hepatic encephalopathy. Abdominal examination re-vealed a smooth liver edge that was nontender. Her abdomen was soft with no evidence of ascites.\n\n【22】Peripheral blood investigations on admission 通用删除1(英):<u>(day 0， Figure 1)</u> noted abnormally elevated transaminases (ie alanine amino-transferase \\[ALT\\] 2800 U/L and aspartate aminotransferase\\[AST\\] 2990 U/L)， and albumin of 36 g/L. Total and conjugated bilirubin levels were elevated at 215 umol/L and 183 umol/L respectively. Her international normalized ratio (INR) was mildly elevated at 1.3 with a normal platelet count of 310x10/L. Her liver enzyme profile was within normal limits before this preg-nancy. Elevations of her total white cell count (11.98×10/L)， neutrophils (8.39x10/L)， ferritin (1260 pg/L)， and lactate de-hydrogenase (672 U/L) were noted. Her hemoglobin and eo-sinophil counts were normal at 144 g/L and 0.24x10/L respec-tively. Blood film analysis showed no features of hemolysis， including echinocytes and erythrocyte fragments.

However， ongoing biochemical deterioration was observed， including profound exacerbations of her hyperbilirubinemia， thrombocytopenia， hypoalbuminemia， and associated coag-ulopathy . At this time， she remained clinical-ly asymptomatic and was not encephalopathic， excluding her persistent jaundice. Serum ceruloplasmin levels were within normal limits， but a 24-hour urine copper collection revealed a mildly elevated copper level (3.66 umol/day， reference range：<0.5 umol/day). An atypical form of Wilson’s disease unmasked by the current pregnancy was considered. She proceeded to have an ophthalmic review and Kayser-Fleischer rings were ex-cluded. Concurrently， a transjugular biopsy of our patient's liv-er was collected and showed features of submassive hepatic necrosis involving ~40% of the parenchyma without fibrosis. Focal steatosis with variable ballooning and cholestasis were\n\n【29】noted. Predominant Kupffer cells and lymphocyte infiltrates were seen admixed among neutrophils and eosinophils. The liver biopsy dry copper weight was normal (0.5 mmol/kg，ref-erence range： <0.6 mmol/kg) and Wilson’s disease was ex-cluded. Possible differential diagnoses considered at this time included a drug-induced liver injury (ie dydrogesterone)， tox-ic hepatic injury， or an undiagnosed fulminant viral hepatitis.\n\n【30】Despite our best supportive care efforts， our patient continued to deteriorate biochemically . She was activated for liver transplantation on day 10 of her admission and an ur-gent multidisciplinary liver transplantation workup as per our local hospital protocols and national policies was undertaken. Obstetric experts were consulted. A termination of the previa-ble fetus before liver transplantation was not recommended. Although the fetus was at high risk of not surviving the current\n\n【31】state of maternal liver failure， liver transplantation during preg-nancy was considered a viable option that may sustain fetal survival. At day 21-22 after her initial admission， the patient clinically decompensated and became acutely encephalopath-ic. Her Glasgow coma scale decreased (E3V4M6) and she de veloped a new sinus tachycardia (130 beats per min) with ol-iguria. Her biochemistry at this time showed an ALT 119 U/L， AST 110 U/L， total bilirubin 465 umol/L， albumin 19 g/L， plate-let count 123x10%L， creatinine 142 umol/L， and INR 4.3. She was admitted to the intensive care unit for ongoing manage-ment. A repeat Doppler ultrasound was performed and showed new ascites with increased echogenicity of the liver. An ob-stetric ultrasound was also performed， which confirmed fe-tal death in utero at 17+5 weeks' gestation. Obstetric opinion recommended that the deceased fetus not be evacuated be-fore the liver transplantation unless she developed severe per vaginal bleeding in her current coagulopathic state. Central venous access was obtained， and she was fluid resuscitated with crystalloid and albumin replacement. Intravenous terlip-ressin and， later， continuous venous-venous hemodiafiltration were instituted to support her hepatorenal syndrome. She was transfused with fresh frozen plasma， cryoprecipitate， vitamin K， and tranexamic acid to correct her underlying coagulopa-thy. Chest radiography noted progressive pulmonary edema and with the progressive deterioration in her conscious state， she was subsequently intubated and ventilated.\n\n【32】Her model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score at this time was 40. A liver from a dead donor was obtained from a neigh-boring state within 48 hours. On day 24 after her initial hospi-tal admission， the patient underwent a combined orthotopic liver transplantation with hysterotomy and evacuation of the deceased fetus without significant intraoperative complica-tion. Histopathological analysis of the explanted liver  showed submassive hepatocellular necrosis with admixture of confluent necrosis (involving >50% of hepatic parenchyma) and regenerative nodules. There was no evidence of any underly-ing dysplastic， neoplastic， or infiltrative disorders (eg iron， cop-per). Features were in keeping with drug-induced fulminant he-patic failure， likely secondary to previous dydrogesterone use. Placental histology showed features of acute chorioamnionitis with early fibrin deposition and ischemic necrosis .\n\n【33】Our patient's postoperative course was essentially unremark-able. She continued to improve clinically and biochemically， with resolution of her transaminitis， coagulopathy， and jaun-dice . Her post-transplant immunosuppression regi-men consisted of tacrolimus 4 mg twice a day， azathioprine 75mg daily， and weaning prednisolone. Valganciclovir 900 mg dai-ly and Bactrim 800/160 mg thrice weekly were provided rou-tinely for CMV and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia prophy-laxis respectively. Psychological support was offered through our local Perinatal Loss Support Service. Regular outpatient\n\n【34】follow-up and biochemical monitoring were performed. Mild elevations in the patient's transaminases were noted at-68-70 days after the patient's initial admission to hospital. A re-peat abdominal Doppler ultrasound was performed and no underlying liver pathology was identified. She continues to remain well and is planning a future pregnancy.\n\n【35】Discussion\n\n【36】Drug-induced liver failure in pregnancy is an uncommon event and represents a diagnosis of exclusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Offending agents typically include acetaminophen and occasionally propylthiouracil， and if fulminant or progressive， may necessitate a liver transplant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，7-9\\]</u>. Hepatic injury related to IF drugs is rare. ICP secondary to IVF occurs in 0.01-2.7% of pregnancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，20，21\\]</u>. Dydrogesterone-related hepatic failure has not been previously reported in preg nancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. To the best of our knowledge， we have reported the first Australian case of a multiparous pregnant woman with dy-drogesterone-induced fulminant hepatic failure requiring a liver transplant complicated by fetal death during the second trimester.\n\n【37】Dydrogesterone is an old progestogen that has been avail-able since the 1970s 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. It is still commonly used in several developing countries for routine IF therapy with significant efficacy. In comparison with other IF options， dydrogester-one has minimal maternal adverse side effects and holds a reputable safety profile among multiple clinical trials and re-views 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. However， recent reports have associated its use with profound neurological， genital， and cardiological abnor-malities in the developing fetus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. To date， liver dysfunction associated with dydrogesterone use has only been reported in two patients from Turkey and Malaysia with mild， self-re-solving hepatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18，19\\]</u>. In both cases， the onset of jaundice and hepatitis occurred within two weeks of commencing dy-drogesterone. The Turkish patient presented with recurrent bouts of hepatitis after dydrogesterone use over a four-year period with comorbid autoimmune hemolytic anemia， sug-gesting an underlying autoimmune hepatitis etiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. In contrast， there was a significant delay of four months before our patient developed rapidly progressive hepatic failure re-quiring liver transplantation. The mechanisms underpinning dydrogesterone-mediated liver injury are not understood. Mustafa and coworkers 通用删除7(英):<u>(2014)</u> have proposed that it poten-tially mimics ICP by means of upregulating estradiol 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Peak estradiol levels in the third trimester， when ICP is particular-ly prevalent， may promote cholestasis by unknown signaling cascades 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，18\\]</u>. Others have suggested a similar role for pro-gesterone and its metabolites， which are similarly found to be upregulated in ICP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. It is plausible that concurrent es-trogen administration with dydrogesterone during IF thera-py may have potentiated our patient's hepatic failure through an ICP-mediated process. However， Germain et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u> have\n\n【38】shown that no serological differences exist in estrogen levels between women with normal pregnancies and ICP， limiting the utility of its routine measurement in IF pregnancies.Others have also shown that elevated bile acids in IF pregnancies are more frequently associated with ICP， but its clinical sen sitivity in predicting ICP remains uncertain通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Altintas et al.通用删除7(英):<u>(2004)</u> have proposed that dydrogesterone may facilitate he patic injury through an idiosyncratic reaction that involves a complex， albeit unknown， interplay between genetic and au-toimmune factors that influence the metabolism of itself and its downstream metabolites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Moreover， its hepatotoxic ef-fects are unpredictable and can last up to several months be-fore becoming clinically evident 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Overall， the idiosyncra-sy of dydrogesterone in mediating hepatocellular necrosis and progressive liver failure remains to be elucidated.\n\n【39】Greenberg and colleagues 通用删除7(英):<u>(2009)</u> previously established an algorithm for managing acute liver failure in pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Under these circumstances， maternal survival outweighs fe-tal welfare， irrespective of the stage of pregnancy. Should the fetus be previable (≤20-25 weeks’ gestation)， careful consid-eration toward a termination of pregnancy versus ongoing maternal and fetal support should be given， particularly as the latter carries significantly higher morbidity and mortali-ty. Reviews of previous case reports and cohort studies have shown that fetal death during pregnancy both pre- and post-liver transplantation is high (up to 23.8%)， particularly during the second trimester通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3，5-7，9-11，15\\]</u>. Of those that survive， developmental delays arising from neurological sequalae are occasionally reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Development and maturation of the central nervous system occurs during week three of embryo-genesis until the 16-17h week of gestation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. The fetus is particularly sensitive to maternal coagulopathy and hyperbili-rubinemia， with the former contributing to placental ischemia and fetal death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26，27\\]</u>. Persistent placental ischemia and dys-function may inadvertently facilitate the placental transfer of excess bilirubin more readily to the fetus， exacerbating cerebral neurotoxicity through several molecular mechanisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. It is likely that the onset of severe hyperbilirubinemia and coagu-lopathy in our patient caused significant impaired neurological development in the fetus at a time when its central nervous\n\n【40】References：\n\n【41】1\\.

Nevertheless，recogni-tion of progressive hepatocellular necrosis through persistent hyperbilirubinemia， coagulopathy，and pseudo-“improvements”in transaminases should prompt early progression toward liv-er transplantation during pregnancy， which may enable fetal survival and avoid significant neonatal morbidity.\n\n【46】Conclusions\n\n【47】Dydrogesterone-mediated hepatic injury and progression to ful-minant hepatic failure is an extremely rare event during preg-nancy.

Typically， the effusion accumulates along the diaphragmat-ic surface of the back heart， and other localizations， such as the transverse sinus， are uncommon. The main risk factor for pericarditis in Europe is viral infection. In this uncommon case， we strongly suspected underly-ing Takayasu syndrome. The positive response to treatment with steroids in pericarditis and Takayasu arteri-tis may be misleading\n\n【27】Case Report：\n\n【28】A 61-year-old woman was admitted to the Cardiology Clinic because of recurrent chest pain in the form of a retrosternal burning pain with radiation to both arms. With the results of laboratory tests， electrocardiogram， and computer tomography (CT)， we excluded acute coronary syndrome， pulmonary embolism， and aortic dis-section. In chest CT and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)， we found an effusion around the ascending aor-ta with uncertain inflammation and in the transverse sinus of the pericardium. After typical pericarditis treat-ment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and afterward with steroids， which is similar to Takayasu syndrome treatment， we observed a significant improvement of the patient's clinical condition and no recurrence of chest pain.\n\n【29】Conclusions： Despite clinical symptoms， laboratory results， and aorta thickening with surrounding inflammation， Takayasu syndrome was excluded by rheumatologists because of the patient's age. Transverse sinus inflammation is a very rare presentation of pericarditis， but should be considered， especially based on TTE and CT imaging， when other possible causes of retrosternal pain are excluded.\n\n【30】Keywords： Pericarditis · Takayasu Arteritis\n\n【31】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/937196\n\n【32】口22228 1\n\n【33】4\n\n【34】16\n\n【35】Pericarditis is an inflammatory process caused by infectious factors， autoimmune diseases， diseases of surrounding organs， metabolic disorders， pregnancy， injuries， neoplastic processes， and idiopathic factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Idiopathic factors are the most com-mon cause for pericarditis in the United Kingdom and Western Europe 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. Most often， this idiopathic factor is caused by viruses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， in contrast to in developing countries， where the main cause is tuberculosis among immunosuppressed pa-tients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，4\\]</u>. Most often， inflammatory effusion accumulates along the diaphragmatic surface of the back heart， but some-times it accumulates in other parts of the pericardium， such as the transverse sinus. Transverse pericardial sinus inflamma-tion is a rare presentation of pericarditis， in which effusion is localized between the ascending aorta and the left atrium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【36】Independent from the location of inflammation， patients with an acute onset of pericarditis experience sudden， sharp pain in the chest， which can radiate to the neck， left shoulder， and jaw. Additionally， shortness of breath， cough，rhinorrhoea， low-grade fever， fatigue， and weight loss could be observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. For this reason， the pericarditis should be differentiated from a myocardial infarction， myocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>， unstable angina， pul-monary embolism， heart failure aggravation， pathological mus-culoskeletal conditions， pneumonia， pneumothorax， lung can-cer， and gastroenterological diseases \\[71.\n\n【37】Pericarditis treatment should be based on the main etiological factor， and usually only high-risk patients with fever， immuno-suppression， anticoagulation therapy or no improvement after an initial 7-day treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammato-ry drugs (NSAIDs) should be considered for hospitalization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. NSAIDs or aspirin with colchicine are the usual first-line treat-ment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The second-line treatment is corticosteroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，6，7\\]</u>. Most patients have a good prognosis， but some develop re-current pericarditis. The main risk factors of complicated peri-carditis are a high level of C-reactive protein (CRP)， early use of corticosteroids， and omission of colchicine in treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【38】Takayasu syndrome is an inflammatory disease of the large and medium arteries， such as the aorta. The first manifesta-tion of this kind of vasculitis could be aortic wall thickening 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> in some cases， but pericarditis in the first phase is rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Corticosteroids are the most common option in the treatment of Takayasu syndrome， similar to the advanced second-line schema for pericarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，11\\]</u>. The diagnosis of Takayasu syn-drome is difficult in daily clinical practice. Among the 6 cri-teria (3 of them should be fulfilled) are age below 40 years， difference in systolic blood pressure of at least 10 mm Hg be-tween the upper limbs， claudication of an upper limb， a mur-mur over a subclavicular artery or abdominal aorta by auscul-tation， weaker pulse， mainly in any of the upper limbs， and\n\n【39】arteriogram abnormality (according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria). At the same time， the literature de-scribes later forms of disease， which is diagnosed in patients over 50 or 60 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，13\\]</u>. The purpose of the pres-ent case was to present a rare course of pericarditis starting with transverse sinus inflammation in a patient with recurrent chest pain of an unknown origin. Additionally， it led to the sus picion of Takayasu syndrome， based on the computed tomog-raphy (CT) scans of the aorta， laboratory tests， and positive re-sponse to the final treatment with steroids.\n\n【40】Case Report\n\n【41】A61-year-old woman had periodic chest pain for nearly 2 years， usually in the form of a retrosternal burning pain with radia-tion to both arms， especially wheninhaling and lying down. The symptoms had been strongly aggravated in the last 2 weeks(3/6 points in visual analogue scale \\[VAS\\])， with accompany-ing dyspnea. Since then， she was hospitalized several times in Emergency Departments and had short-lasting clinical ef-fect after various medications and after acute coronary syn-dromes were excluded， based on Troponin T (TnT) protocols and repeated electrocardiograms (ECGs). Because of a his-tory of asthma， she was also hospitalized in the Pulmonary Department， where， once again， cardiac ischemia was excluded based on TnT (0.004 ng/mL； N<0.014 ng/mL) and ECG findings. In angiographic CT of the chest， pulmonary embo-lism， aortic dissection，and pneumonia were excluded， but the examination revealed a slight contrast enhancement around the ascending aorta within the pericardium. Additionally，the coronary vessels visible in the scans had neither features of calcifications nor relevant stenosis； therefore，invasive coronary angiography had not been performed. Moreover， the patient's case was discussed with invasive cardiologists and cardiac sur-geons in reference hospital，and no indications for invasive di-agnostics or treatment were found. No additional pericardi-al effusion was observed at that time. Because of a high CRP level (123 mg/L； N<5 mg/L) and sterile blood cultures， empir-ical antibiotic therapy was included (clarithromycin， cefurox-ime). With a primary diagnosis of aortic inflammatory pro-cess， the patient was transferred to our clinic for further care.\n\n【42】On physical examination， an audible systolic murmur in the Erb's point and on the apex (3/6) was detected， without any other clinically relevant pathology. In laboratory tests， CRP (71.9mg/L)， erythrocyte sedimentation rate (OB， 87 mm/h)， fibrino-gen (670 mg/dL)， platelet count (663x10/uL)， and NT-pro-BNP(476 pg/mL) were significantly elevated. Moreover， the tests showed anemia (Hb 10.2 g/dL)， without leucocytosis . The transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed hyperecho-genic pericardial effusion in the vicinity of the ascending aor-ta and the left atrium (max 10-11 mm in diastole)， without\n\n【43】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

After additional sessions with radiologists and re-interpreta-tion of the previous TTEs and chest CT scans， a rare diagno-sis of transverse sinus pericarditis was proposed .\n\n【47】After 12 days， despite the treatment with colchicine (0.5 mg per day)， NSAID (ibuprofen 600 mg 3 times a day)， and anti-biotics (cefuroxime 750 mg 3 times a day with ciprofloxacin\n\n【48】400 mg 2 times a day， then amikacin 500 mg 2 times a day and metronidazole 500 mg 3 times a day)， the chest pain was sig-nificantly aggravated (9/10 points on VAS scale)， with a need of strong analgesics usage，including morphine. Temporarily， the patient needed vasopressors because of a tendency to low blood pressure (85/55 mm Hg). In laboratory tests， worsening of anemia (8.2 g/dL)， increased thrombocytosis (490 tys/uL)， and increased CRP level (185 mg/L) were observed. In repeated\n\n【49】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2.

In angio-CT of the chest， enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes were detected， as well as further thickening in the wall of aortic arch and ascending aorta to 3.5 mm. In chest X-ray， an accu-mulation of effusion in the right pleural space was confirmed. The viral or bacterial background was excluded (B and C hep-atitis， Lyme disease， odontogenic focus)， as well as tubercu-losis， which remains a very important differential diagnosis for autoimmune diseases. The examination of the right pleu-ral effusion showed transudate， without any bacterial infec-tion. Considering no evidence for bacterial etiology of pericar-dial effusion and no presentation of cardiac tamponade with a high risk of complications after paracentesis， we withdrew\n\n【52】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4. Transthoracic echocardiography showing increased amount of pericardial effusion despite immediate treatment with an NSAID (ibuprofen) and colchicine. Pleural effusion is present.</u>\n\n【53】from this procedure， suspecting an autoimmune background of the disease. There were no indices of neoplastic diseases in additional diagnostics (endoscopy， abdominal CT scan). Finally， corticosteroids (prednisone) were added as the second-line pericarditis treatment.\n\n【54】After 6 days of prednisone treatment with 60 mg a day， the pa-tient reported having no chest pain. The follow-up TTE showed significant reduction of pericardial effusion (1-2 mm in diasto-le). Furthermore， the level of CRP decreased significantly (16.1mg/L)， but the platelet number increased at the same time (998tys/uL). Due to previous inflammatory changes in the aortic wall and the quick and positive reaction to prednisone treatment， Takayasu syndrome was suspected， although the criteria accord-ing to the American College of Rheumatology were not sufficient-ly fulfilled. The patient was discharged with plans for further di-agnostics and treatment in the Rheumatology Outpatient Clinic.\n\n【55】The entire pharmacological treatment lasted 3 months (ASA and ibuprofen for 3 weeks， colchicine for 3 months， and pred-nisone for about 12 weeks， in decreasing doses). In the follow-up TTE and angio-CT scan of the chest after the first 12 months， there were further reductions of pericardial effusion and aor-tic wall thickening observed. In the Hematology Department， any significant bone marrow failure was excluded. Moreover， Takayasu syndrome was finally excluded by the Rheumatology Department， as the necessary 3 of 6 diagnostic criteria were not fulfilled (they could not be fulfilled because the patient was>40 years old). Therefore， the reason for the unusual pericar-ditis and aortic inflammation were not fully clarified. Similarly， the accompanying anemia seemed to have an inflammatory au-toimmune background， because the hematological and onco-logical background were excluded and the anemia significantly and permanently improved after the treatment with steroids.\n\n【56】The patient remained under cardiologic and rheumatologic fol-low-up， without recurrence of the primary symptoms， despite occasionally having some slight retrosternal pain.\n\n【57】Discussion\n\n【58】Pericarditis is an inflammatory process caused by many dif-ferent risk factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Without typical symptoms on physical examination， about 85% of patients present with pericardial friction rub， which is similar to pleural friction \\[14 but is not mandatory for the final diagnosis， especially when the pericar-dial effusion is relatively recent and not yet hyperechogenic. In electrocardiography， diffuse ST segment elevations and PR segment depression (especially present in l， Il， aVL， V3-V5) are typical， dependent on the location of the pericardial inflamma-tion and accompanying myocarditis. QT prolongation is mostly not present， compared to in acute coronary syndromes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，14\\]</u>. In laboratory tests， CRP， troponin， and CK-MB levels are usu-ally elevated. In noninvasive diagnostic technologies， such as TTE， transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)， CT， and cardiac magnetic resonance， we can find a pericardial effusion coex-isting with or without adjacent heart muscle impairment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Despite the highly advanced imaging in CT and cardiac magnet-ic resonance， liquid in the transverse sinus is most commonly detected incidentally. The main issue for the clinician is to cor-rectly differentiate the normal and pathological structure sur-rounding the heart 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>， and the transverse sinus is certainly one of the structures communicating between the left and right pericardial space in the close vicinity of the 2 outflow arteries of the heart. For these reasons， the preferred method should be TTE or TEE. Transthoracic parasternal long-axis views and transesophageal long-axis views show space between the as-cending aorta and the left atrium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In daily clinical practice， all noninvasive methods should be complementary and widely used， although they are available only at more advanced sites.\n\n【59】In the present case， during prolonged hospitalization， we per-formed comprehensive diagnostics and confirmed the diagno-sis of rare transverse sinus pericarditis， which later developed into larger pericardial effusion. Our patient presented the typ-ical symptoms of pericarditis， such as acute pain in the chest and dyspnea when lying down. Additionally， the laboratory tests showed an ongoing inflammatory process. Although we performed thorough diagnostic testing， a specific risk factor and the inflammatory trigger were primarily not found. In ac-cordance with cardiology guidelines， in the first-line treatment we used an NSAID (ibuprofen) and colchicine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，7\\]</u>， with no improvement. Therefore， after necessary exclusion of bacteri-al infection or tuberculosis， corticosteroids were implement-ed as the second-line treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. The advantage of this therapy is quick symptom relief； however， according to many systematic reviews and meta-analyses， there is a relationship\n\n【60】between corticosteroid use and an increase in the risk of dis-ease recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. Another meta-analysis by Mager et al showed the combination of colchicine and prednisone results in an increase of the recurrence rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【61】In the present case， the patient's clinical condition deteriorat-ed quickly under the colchicine and NSAID treatment. After addition of the corticosteroids to the schema， we observed a rapid improvement of the clinical condition， regression of the pericardial effusion， and CRP level normalization. Based on that， a dysfunction of the immune processes was suspected. Moreover， imaging tests revealed thickening of the aortic arch and ascending aorta， which indicated an ongoing inflamma-tory process in this vessel. Based on the obtained results， we suspected Takayasu syndrome. Unfortunately， the subsequent tests by rheumatologists did not confirm the diagnosis， since the patient met only 2 necessary diagnostic criteria. Takayasu arteritis can have a spectrum of presentation ranging from as-ymptomatic to catastrophic disease， presenting as malignant hypertension. As symptoms are nonspecific and the disease is so rare， there is often a delay in detecting it. In our case， de-spite the clinical presentation， aortic inflammation on CT scan， and positive laboratory tests， Takayasu syndrome could not be confirmed. Fortunately， despite many risk factors of recurrent pericarditis (like high level of inflammatory factors， bad gen-eral condition， combination of colchicine and steroids)， a new onset of pericarditis has not been observed for more than 36months， at the time of this report.\n\n【62】Conclusions\n\n【63】Transverse sinus inflammation is a rare presentation of peri-carditis， but should be considered， especially based on TTE and CT images， when other possible causes of retrosternal pain are excluded. Each time， a thorough search for the background of pericarditis should be done， as the reason enables efficient and life-saving treatment to be conducted. In the present case， de-spite symptoms， laboratory results， and aorta thickening with surrounding inflammation， Takayasu syndrome was excluded by the rheumatologists because of the patient's age and lack of additional criteria set by the American College of Rheumatology； although， from the clinical point of view， there was a strong suspicion of the disease. Fortunately， the steroid-based phar-macological treatment was successful， independent of the con-firmation of this rare rheumatic disease， which we think first oresented with transverse sinus inflammation.\n\n【64】Declaration of Figures’Authenticity\n\n【65】All figures submitted have been created by the authors who confirm that the images are original with no duplication and have not been previously published in whole or in part.\n\n【66】1\\.

Only 31 cases have been reported. Typical presentation includes a slowly enlarging， painless testicular mass. Associated findings are gynecomastia， decreased libido， and erectile dysfunction. Immunohistochemistry can be used to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【22】Case Rrport：\n\n【23】A 22-year-old male presented with complaint of mild pain in both testicles. A testicular ultrasound revealed a4.0x3.8x4.6 mm hypoechoic lesion within the left testicle. Serum tumor markers (STM) included lactate dehy-drogenase (LDH) measuring 146 IU/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(98-192)</u>， serum alpha-1-fetoprotein (AFP)， 2.89 ng/mL 通用删除7(英):<u>(0-9)</u>， and plas-ma beta human chorionic gonadotropin (Beta HCG) measuring less than 0.50 mlU/mL (k<0.50-2.67). Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast was normal. A radical orchi-ectomy was recommended but the patient refused. He agreed to surveillance with imaging and serum tumor markers (STM). The patient’s testicular ultrasound showed the mass to be stable in size and STMs remained negative. The patient agreed to an orchiectomy 9 months after his diagnosis. This case is the first reported with c-kit-positive immunohistochemistry. His post-operative course has been unremarkable.\n\n【24】Conclusions：\n\n【25】AGCTT is a rare tumor and information regarding its presentation， gross and microscopic morphology， and im-munohistochemical characteristics is lacking. This report provides an update of the immunohistochemical find-ings and adds to the available data concerning this tumor. Based on the results of this case， future reports that include c-kit immunohistochemistry would be beneficial to evaluate its utility in diagnosing AGCTT.\n\n【26】MeSH Keywords： Granulosa Cell Tumor ·Immunohistochemistry·Inhibins·Testicular Neoplasms ·Vimentin\n\n【27】Full-text PDF http：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/891389\n\n【28】11690 1 HL\n\n【29】4\n\n【30】Granulosa cell tumors (GCT) are classified as sex cord-stromal tumors of the gonads. Other tumor types included in this class are thecomas， fibromas， Sertoli， Leydig， and Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. GCTs are divided into 2 different types： juvenile and adult 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The juvenile type is one of the most common testis neoplasms occurring in the first 6 months of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The adult type is very rare and occurs over a broad age range. Only31 cases of adult GCT of the testis (AGCTT) have been report-ed to date 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. A number of clinical， morphological， and immu-nohistochemical characteristics have emerged through vari-ous studies that assist in diagnosing AGCTT. In over one-half of cases， the clinical presentation is one of slow， painless en-largement over a variable period of time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-6\\]</u>. The average age of diagnosis is 47 years and ranges from 12 to 77 years通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，7\\]</u>. Gynecomastia， decreased libido， and erectile dysfunc-tion may also be present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，7\\]</u>. Gross morphologic analysis of AGCTT cells typically shows a solid， well-circumscribed， lobular mass that may have a fibrous pseudocapsule.Microscopically， AGCTTs typically show round cells with pale-to-eosinophilic， scant cytoplasm and round or oval nuclei with a characteris-tic “coffee-bean\" nuclear groove， fine chromatin， and incon-spicuous nucleoli 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，8\\]</u>. Rarely， theca cells may be visualized surrounding the testicular parenchyma along with Leydig cell hyperplasia and Sertoli cell nodules. Call-Exner bodies， while not essential， are very often present and aid in differentiat-ing AGCTT from the juvenile type 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6，9，10\\]</u>. Growth patterns are variable and include solid， microfollicular， gyriform， insu-lar， trabecular， or pseudosarcomatous 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，11\\]</u>. The mitotic rate is highly variable and ranges from less than 1 to 50 mitoses per high-power field (HPF) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Immunohistochemical analy-sis， while not essential， can be helpful in establishing the di-agnosis in more ambiguous cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. AGCTTs typically ex-hibit immunopositivity to vimentin， inhibin， smooth muscle actin (SMA)， MIC2 (CD99)， and calretinin. A positive reaction with pancytokeratin antibodies or 5100 may be seen in some cases. A negative immunohistochemical response is typical-ly seen with epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and placen-tal alkaline phosphatase (PLAP). Many other immunohisto-chemical tests have been used in a small number of cases or are underreported，making analysis difficult  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7，10\\]</u>. While the AGCTTs are distinctly uncommon and most often benign， slow growing， and non-functioning， they do have the potential for distant metastases that lead to poor outcomes通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，12\\]</u>. Patients with metastasis to regional lymph nodes typ-ically have a relatively long survival period； however， patients that have distant metastasis exhibit rapid disease progres-sion with death occurring a few months to a few years after metastases have occurred 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Metastasis has been reported most commonly to the retroperitoneal lymph nodes， but lung， liver， and bone metastases have also been noted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，12，13\\]</u>. The most recent evidence indicates that approximately 20%\n\n【31】of cases of AGCTTs are malignant； however， due to the very limited number of cases， factors predictive of malignancy have yet to be well defined. Early research failed to reliably identify factors predictive of malignancy， but Jimenez-Quintero et al. suggested that size greater 7.0 cm， presence of lymphovascu-lar invasion， hemorrhage， and necrosis might be indicative of malignancy because these characteristics were present in the malignant cases they identified 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，11\\]</u>. More recently， Hansen and Ambaye evaluated patient age， laterality， presence of gy-necomastia， tumor size， and presence of mitoses and necro-sis in an attempt to determine valid variables for prediction of malignancy. Of the variables analyzed，only tumor size greater than 5.0 cm achieved statistical significance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Initial man-agement of a suspected AGCTT is radical orchiectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，14\\]</u>. Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection should be considered in cases with pathology suggestive of malignant features or if small-volume metastatic disease is present. If performed， it should immediately follow orchiectomy. Patients with wide-spread， unresectable metastatic disease have a very poor prog nosis because these tumors are not amenable to chemothera-py or radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In cases believed to have low malignant potential， ultrasound of the abdomen and testis， coupled with clinical examination， may be sufficient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. With larger tumors or tumors deemed to be aggressive， more extensive follow-up may be warranted. One suggested follow-up regimen consists of abdominal and testicular ultrasound coupled with chest x-ray alternated with CT of the abdomen and pelvis at 6-month intervals. The duration of follow-up is not well-defined； how-ever， as noted above， metastasis has been discovered more than 10 years after treatment， so long-term follow-up is man-datory 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Further analysis is necessary to identify factors that can reliably predict tumor behavior.\n\n【32】Case Report\n\n【33】A 22-year-old male presented with complaint of mild pain in both testicles. He denied dysuria， urethral discharge， back pain， abdominal pain， or recent illness. He denied personal or family history of genitourinary disease. Past medical history was not significant. The patient denied previous abdominal or genitourinary surgeries. The patient quit smoking in 2012 and had a 3 pack-year history. Vital signs were within normal lim-its. Physical exam was remarkable for tenderness and swell-ing in both epididymides； however， no masses or tenderness were noted on palpation of the testicles. Other pertinent find-ings included the absence of cervical， supraclavicular， or in-guinal lymphadenopathy， gynecomastia， urethral discharge，or scrotal swelling. Abdominal examination revealed no mass-es or tenderness. Urinalysis showed no blood， leukocytes， or protein and was negative for nitrite and leukocyte esterase. A testicular ultrasound revealed a 4.0x3.8x4.6 mm hypoecho-ic lesion within the anterior aspect of the left testicle. Serum\n\n【34】Table 1.

The patient agreed to an orchiectomy approximately 9 months after his initial diagnosis. Radical or-chiectomy was performed with no complications. The surgical specimen consisted of the left testis， weighing 69 grams and measuring 4.8×3.5×2.9 cm. Sectioning of the testis revealed an irregularly-shaped tan-white lesion with a firm cut surface in the otherwise unremarkable fleshy， beige testicular paren-chyma. The lesion measured 0.6 cm in its greatest dimension and was enveloped in a thin capsule No invasion of the sur-rounding tiss ue was noted. There was no evidence of hemor-rhage or necrosis and there was no gross involvement of the tunica albuginea. Routine hematoxylin- and eosin-stained tis-sue sections revealed the lesion to be composed of granulo-sa cells in a predominantly microfollicular pattern， although trabecular and insular patterns were present. The microfol-licles were filled with eosinophilic secretions characteristic of Call-Exner bodies. The surrounding granulosa cell nuclei\n\n【41】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3.

Consistent with the gross impression， the lesion had a thin fibrous capsule and was non-infiltrative. Figure 1 illus-trates the major morphologic findings. Immunohistochemical stains were performed with appropriately reactive controls(Ventana， Tucson AZ). The tumor cells showed strong mem-brane and cytoplasmic staining for inhibin， as demonstrated in Figure 2. The cells also showed strong cytoplasmic staining for calretinin . Other antigens that were positive in-cluded vimentin ， MIC2 (CD99)， SMA， and c-kit. Ki-67revealed a mitotic index of approximately 10%. Other nega-tive immunohistochemical stains included chromogranin， syn-aptophysin， PLAP， EMA， and pancytokeratin. Given the histo-pathologic findings， as well as the immunohistochemistry，the patient was diagnosed with AGCTT. To date， post-operative surveillance including ultrasound and clinical examinations have been unremarkable.\n\n【44】AGCTT is rarely encountered； therefore， other more common diagnoses need to be eliminated before the diagnosis can be made. AGCTT can be differentiated from juvenile GCTT by the presence of Call-Exner bodies or“coffee-bean”nucleiin the for-mer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Additionally， juvenile GCTT is usually diagnosed in pa-tients aged 4 years and younger， but it has been diagnosed in adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Yolk sac tumors are usually positive for PLAP， cytoker-atin， and AFP， whereas AGCTT is usually negative for these im-munohistochemical tests. Hematopoietic malignancies，though they may share some histologic similarities with AGCTT， can be differentiated by the presence of leukocyte common antigen(LCA， CD45). Metastatic carcinoma is usually positive for cyto-keratin. Carcinoid tumors， whether primary or metastatic， are typically positive for synaptophysin， chromogranin， and cyto-keratin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，15\\]</u>. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors are usually positive for pancytokeratin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Although not required for diagnosis， the im-munohistochemical staining profile of AGCTTs can help confirm the diagnosis in equivocal cases. As noted in Table 1， vimentin， SMA， MIC2， calretinin， and inhibin are consistently positive， but EMA， pancytokeratin， and PLAP are typically negative. To the best of our knowledge， this case is the first to demonstrate c-kit positive immunohistochemistry. Excluding this finding， the typical immunohistochemical profile presented in other reports was supported. It was suggested in a previous report that in-hibin may be an equivocal tumor marker； however， the most recent reports， including this case， have demonstrated inhibin\n\n【45】References：\n\n【46】1\\.

Dysarthria， a state of difficult or unclear articulation of speech， has been reported as a rare side effect of irinotecan through multi-ple case reports and case series， but with limited published data aimed at understanding the underlying mech-anism and effective management strategies\n\n【13】Case Reports： We describe herein 3 cases of patients with pancreatic malignancy who experienced dysarthria while being treated with a chemotherapy regimen containing irinotecan at an ambulatory outpatient satellite chemother-apy site. All patients described received first-line FOLFIRINOX for pancreatic cancer and experienced dysarthria during their first infusion of irinotecan. In all cases， dysarthria was observed as a transient adverse drug reac-tion within the first 10 to 70 min of irinotecan infusion， which resolved rapidly upon pausing infusion without any long-term sequalae.\n\n【14】All patients remained conscious and alert； physical and neurological examinations at dysarthria onset revealed no abnormalities. Some patients experienced distal extremity paresthesia， a known manifestation of oxaliplatin-induced acute neurotoxicity， and diaphoresis and nausea. Increased infusion time effectively prevented dysar-thria during subsequent infusions.\n\n【15】Conclusions： Oncologists， pharmacists， nurses， and other care team members should be aware that irinotecan-associated dysarthria is a rare， mild， and self-limiting phenomenon to avoid inadvertently altering or withholding therapy. We suggest extending irinotecan infusion time， as opposed to dose reduction or treatment discontinuation， as a practical clinical management strategy for patients who develop recurrent dysarthria secondary to irinote-can infusion.\n\n【16】MeSH Keywords： Antineoplastic Agents ·Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions · Pancreatic Neoplasms\n\n【17】Ful-text PDE https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/924058\n\n【18】目名22795 1 山司甘 127\n\n【19】Irinotecan， a semisynthetic cytotoxic alkaloid extracted from plants such as Camptotheca acuminata， is a commonly used cytotic chemotherapy agent used in the treatment of multi-ple malignancies， particularly of gastrointestinal origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. Irinotecan is a prodrug that requires in vivo activation by car-boxylesterases to yield its active and potent metabolite， SN-38， which works in a cell cycle phase-specific (S phase) mecha-nism to inhibit the action of topoisomerase l， an enzyme that produces reversible single-strand breaks in DNA during DNA replication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-7\\]</u>. These single-strand breaks relieve torsional strain and allow DNA replication to proceed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，5-7\\]</u>.Irinotecan and SN-38 bind to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and pre-vent DNA replication and cell division 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，4-7\\]</u>.

Identified through postmarketing surveillance， it is reflected in the drug mono-graph as an uncommon adverse drug reaction (ADR) in pa-tients receiving irinotecan and has been reported in multiple case reports in the literature as occurring secondary to irino-tecan infusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，14-22\\]</u>. However， the precise pathogenesis of this neurotoxic effect and optimal management strategies have yet to be elucidated.\n\n【23】We highlight 3 patients with pancreatic malignancies who were treated at the Winchester District Memorial Hospital in Ottawa， Ontario， with irinotecan-containing FOLFIRINOX.\n\n【24】Patient (A)\n\n【25】Patient A was a 56-year-old female patient with metastatic pan-creatic cancer who presented to the clinic for first-line treat-ment with FOLFIRINOX with palliative intent. A computerized tomography (CT) scan completed before treatment initiation showed a hypodense mass of 41x26 mm in the pancreatic body with likely involvement of the celiac axis， common hepatic ar-tery， and splenic artery. She had no other known medical condi-tions， no smoking history， and no allergies or previously record-ed ADRs or intolerances to medications. The pre-chemotherapy biochemical and blood count (CBC) results were within nor-mal range. The Karnofsky Performance Scale was 90 (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status equivalent， 0)， indicating the patient was able to carry on normal activity with minor signs or symptoms of the disease.\n\n【26】During the first cycle of FOLFIRINOX，administered as per CCO guidelines， the patient reported slurred speech 10 min after the start of the irinotecan infusion， which the patient described as having a “funny tongue\" feeling， accompanied by mild chest tightness and light-headedness. Infusion was paused until symptoms resolved 15 min later， without the need for addi-tional hypersensitivity medications. The patient remained alert throughout the infusion. Physical and neurological examina-tions， including vital signs， conducted at the first onset of dys-arthria revealed no additional abnormalities.\n\n【27】The patient was re-challenged at 74 rate over 360 min. A trial increase in rate to zz (over 180 min) resulted in symptom recur-rence including slurred speech， chest tightness， and dizziness. The electrocardiogram did not reveal any abnormal findings. Intravenous diphenhydramine 50 mg and methylpredniso-lone 125 mg were administered， and provided symptom re-lief. Irinotecan was restarted at y4 rate for 15 min， increased to Yz rate for 15 min， and then resumed to the regular rate for the remainder. Although there was no reoccurrence of dysar-thria， nausea and vomiting occurred resulting in the adminis-tration of metoclopramide 10 mg .\n\n【28】During the second cycle， treatment was better tolerated with mild dysarthria during the irinotecan infusion rate of 90 min with the absence of other symptoms. Following this， the care team decided to increase the infusion time from 90 min to180 min for the third cycle. In addition to this change， the ox-aliplatin dose was reduced to 75% of the first dose due to neuropathy. The patient began exhibiting difficulty articulating\n\n【29】words 90 min after the infusion started， although the patient described this as less prominent than the previous cycle. Upon physical examination， no swelling or shortness of breath was noted. Symptoms resolved within 30 min of going home.\n\n【30】During the fourth cycle， Irinotecan was administered over180 min. The patient noted having slurred speech and nau-sea despite pre-treatment with dexamethasone 12 mg and diphenhydramine 50 mg Ⅳ. Irinotecan infusion was paused， and metoclopramide 10 mg l was given as per medical direc-tive， and symptom resolution occurred within 15 min. The pa-tient was discharged with mild slurring， which was less pro-nounced than in the first treatment， and the patient stated it resolved in less than 1 h.\n\n【31】During the fifth cycle， some slurred speech was noticed half-way through the infusion despite receiving premedication (di-phenhydramine infusion was given over 3 h). Treatment was tolerated well. The patient continued to have mildly slurred speech at the end of the infusion.\n\n【32】After a 4-month chemotherapy holiday， the patient resumed irinotecan infusion， which was administered over 180 min with 50 mg lV dimenhydrinate administered as a pre-medi-cation. Mild speech changes were noted at the end of treat-ment， although the patient reported feeling well otherwise. Vitals showed stable conditions.\n\n【33】Patient (B)\n\n【34】Patient B was a 72-year-old female patient with metastatic pancreatic cancer who presented to the clinic for first-line FOLFIRINOX treatment with palliative intent. She had no his-tory of drug allergies or ADRs. The patient’s complete biochem-ical and CBC results administered before the start of chemo-therapy were within normal range.\n\n【35】For the patient's first cycle， irinotecan was dosed according to CCO guidelines with no prophylactic atropine due to pre-existing treatment-resistant constipation and concern that at-ropine may worsen this. After 70 min of infusion， the patient reported that her“mouth was\\] paralyzed\" and that she was having a sensation like a hot flash； slightly slurred speech was noted. The irinotecan infusion was stopped until symptoms re-solved 15 min later. The infusion was resumed at Y rate (over180 min) with no further speech changes. Vitals remained sta-ble. The remaining treatment was tolerated well apart from some neuropathy that occurred intermittently post-treatment.\n\n【36】During the second cycle， irinotecan was given at a reduced rate over 225 min due to the slurred speech that occurred during the previous treatment and the patient's anxiety about experi-encing a similar sensation during this treatment. This resulted\n\n【37】in no further incidence of slurred speech. During the third cy-cle， the oncologist recommended a trial of irinotecan to be administered over 180 min. No speech changes were noted.\n\n【38】Patient (C)\n\n【39】Patient C was a 68-year-old female diagnosed with moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the distal pancreas with neg-ative margins and positive LV1/perineural invasion. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a 3.7x2.1 cm low-density lesion arising from the pancreatic tail along with a 24x18 cm multiloculated cyst in the mesentery with internal septations. There was no evident metastasis. She received 12 cycles of FOLFIRINOX with adjuvant intent.\n\n【40】While the patient was receiving the irinotecan infusion as per guidelines during her first cycle， she reported a change in vi-sion and difficulty with speech and swallowing 20 min after infusion start， which was described by the patient as a“thick tongue” sensation. No changes were made at this time， and the infusion was continued. The patient noted this sensation lasted for 3 to 4 h after the completion of chemotherapy and had attributed it to atropine. Vital signs were stable and neuro-logical assessments revealed no abnormalities. The care team discussed the option to hold atropine for the next treatment and only administer reactively if abdominal cramping or di-arrhea was present. In addition to the dysarthria， the patient had been experiencing troublesome neuropathy in the fingers and toes. Unlike the dysarthria which resolved， the neuropa-thy had not improved upon the completion of chemotherapy.\n\n【41】For the second cycle， atropine was held. Slurred speech was noticed 30 min after the start of the irinotecan infusion， and the patient expressed difficulty in articulating words； however， this episode was less severe than during the previous treat-ment. No changes in vision were expressed and vitals were sta ble. The infusion was stopped， and symptoms resolved with-in 10 min. The infusion was resumed at l2 rate (over 180 min) with some return of slurred speech at the end of the infusion. The patient noted that the slurred speech was not as severe as it was during the previous treatment， and it resolved soon after the patient left the department.\n\n【42】For the third cycle， irinotecan was run over 180 min as ordered by the oncologist， with no incidence of speech changes. For the fourth cycle， irinotecan was trialed over 150 min as per oncologist orders， and the patient began experiencing slightly slurred speech after 10 min of irinotecan infusion. This prompt-ed a change back to 180 min， with minimum speech changes by the end of the infusion. This rate was maintained for sub-sequent treatments.\n\n|  | Patient (A)  | Patient (B)  | Patient (C)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age/sex  | 56/F  | 72/F  | 68/F  |\n| Diagnosis  | Pancreatic cancer， metastatic  | Pancreatic cancer， adjuvant  | Pancreatic cancer， resected  |\n| Chemotherapy regimen  | FOLFIRINOX  | FOLFIRINOX  | FOLFIRINOX  |\n| Irinotecan-inducedneurological manifestation  | Slurred speech，“funny tonguefeeling\"， mild chest tightness，mild light-headedness  | “Mouth is paralyzed”， slightslurred speech， “hot flash”  | “Thick tongue”， visionchanges， diffic ult with speech  |\n| Other side effects with Chemotherapy regimen  | Neuropathy  | None  | None  |\n| Onset from the start of Irinotecan Infusion (min)  | 10  | Immediately  | 10  |\n| Dose of irinotecan infusion (mg/m²)  | 180  | 180  | 180  |\n| Duration of dysarthria (hours)  | 6  | 3  | 8  |\n\n【44】In the present study， we reported 3 cases of rare， transient dys-arthria occurring in patients undergoing first-line irinotecan-containing FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer. Table 1 provides a summary of the 3 patients with irinotecan-associated dysarthria.\n\n【45】Episodes of dysarthria were described by patients in many ways， including the sensation of a “thick” or “funny\"tongue， as well as experiencing difficulty swallowing and enunciating words. These symptoms were objectively described by attend-ing clinicians as slurred speech. In all cases， dysarthria was observed as a transient ADR occurring within the first 10 to70 min of irinotecan infusion. All patients remained alert and conscious， and neurological examinations at the onset of dys-arthria revealed no abnormalities， which is in line with pre-viously reported cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，15-21\\]</u>. A range of time-to-onset of dysarthria has been reported in the literature from occurring shortly after start of infusion to several h after infusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15-16\\]</u>. Further， other cases described in the literature ranged from15 min to 24 h in duration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，17，18\\]</u>. Of note， there is some heterogeneity in cases described in terms of diagnoses， with most cases occurring in metastatic colorectal carcinomas， as well as in doses and duration of initial infusion， ranging from80 to 350 mg/m? and 30 to 120 min， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，15-21\\]</u>.\n\n【46】Identification of the causative agent of dysarthria was based on the time-to-event relationship between irinotecan infusion and dysarthria. It has been hypothesized that irinotecan-asso-ciated dysarthria can be exacerbated by concurrent administra-tion of oxaliplatin， a platinum compound in FOLFIRINOX with known neurotoxic side effects； however， dysarthria has also\n\n【47】occurred in patients treated with non-oxaliplatin containing regimens such as FOLFIRl， and has never been described with oxaliplatin-only regimens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. This suggests that irinotecan is the primary drug responsible for the dysarthria. However， as proposed by Matsuoka et al.， it is plausible that FOLFIRINOX-associated dysarthria is associated with the sequence of drug administration (i.e.， V infusion of oxaliplatin， immediately fol-lowed by irinotecan)， wherein the initial treatment of oxalipla-tin may prime the occurrence of dysarthria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. This is based on the relative lack of case reports seen for FOLFOXIRI in which irinotecan is administered prior to oxaliplatin.\n\n【48】The frequency of dysarthria in patients undergoing FOLFIRINOX treatment has been widely reported in the literature. Gunturu et al. reported 9 cases of dysarthria occurring in a US hospital among 35 patients (25.7%) during irinotecan administration with symptoms including dysarthric speech， facial or perioral paresthesia， leg cramps， ataxia and blepha-rospasm. A phase Il trial in Japan reported 5 cases among 36patients (13.8%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21，22\\]</u>. Further， a hospital in Japan reported4 cases of dysarthria among 9 patients receiving FOLFIRINOX(44.4%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. These differences highlight a need to character-ize risk factors for irinotecan-associated dysarthria， such as the possible role of ethnicity.\n\n【49】The mechanism by which central nervous system toxicity oc-curs after irinotecan infusion is not well understood. However. cholinergic toxicity has been proposed as a possible mech-anism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，16\\]</u>. It has been proposed that irinotecan and its metabolite increase cholinergic activity by binding to the ac-tive site of the acetylcholinesterase， resulting in its functional inhibition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. The hypoglossal nerve， which has a role in speech function through its innervation of tongue muscles，\n\n【50】has a higher density of cholinergic receptors compared to oth-er brainstem nuclei， resulting in an increased intrinsic sensi-tivity to cholinergic stimulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Further， the density of cholinergic receptors is relatively high in the brainstem nuclei and the application of cholinergic agents results in a large in crease in hypoglossal nerve activity， which innervates the tongue muscles， resulting in overstimulation manifested as dysarthria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Based on this hypothesis， atropine would be a reasonable medical intervention； however， when adminis tered at therapeutic doses， it has minimal effects on the cen-tral nervous systems 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Other agents such as scopolamine， with increased central nervous system activity， may have a role in managing irinotecan-induced dysarthria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Further， pre-dictive factors for the development of cholinergic syndrome， as determined by an ordered logistic regression analysis con-ducted by Kanbayashi et al.， may shed light on predictive fac-tors of this toxicity including female sex， and irinotecan dose2175 mg通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>.\n\n【51】In further support of the cholinergic hypothesis， patients de-scribed in the present study also experienced classical choliner-gic symptoms including rhinitis， acute-onset diarrhea， and ab-dominal pain. One of the 3 patients in this study experienced diaphoresis， described by the patient as a\"hot flash.\"Known symptoms of cholinergic syndrome include rhinitis， hypersali-vation， miosis， lacrimation， diaphoresis， flushing， diarrhea， and abdominal cramping 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18，20\\]</u>.\n\n【52】There have been a few successful management strategies， primarily based on case reports， reported in the literature. Gunturu et al. presented patient cases wherein symptoms re-mitted with interruption and dose reduction of the irinotecan infusion， with some recurrence upon re-challenging. With re-currence， administration of anticholinergic agents (atropine and/or diphenhydramine) resulted in complete symptomatic recovery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. This was similarly seen in case study reported by Lee et al. wherein dysarthria disappeared with the discontinu-ation of irinotecan therapy and reappeared with subsequent administration of irinotecan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Matsuoka et al. presented case reports ofhaving prevented or alleviated symptoms with intramuscular atropine administration and further described a management option of utilizing atropine prophylactically as a prevention strategy， presumingly due its antagonistic ac-tion of the acetylcholine receptor 20\\]. However， this strategy has failed to demonstrate benefit in other studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，25，26\\]</u>.\n\n【53】In the present study， where 2 out of the 3 patients did not use atropine due to refusal or constipation concerns，extend-ing the infusion time of irinotecan to at least 180 min was ef-fective in preventing reoccurrence. This observed correlation suggests a pharmacokinetic relationship may exist， where-by irinotecan or its metabolite may accumulate more rap-idly when infused over a shorter period of time， resulting in toxicity. This hypothesis has been explored through investi-gations of irinotecan and SN-38 accumulation in plasma lev-els； however， accumulation in the cerebrospinal fluid has yet to be explored 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18，26\\]</u>. One pharmacokinetic study conduct-ed in a nonhuman primate model concluded that the level of irinotecan in the cerebrospinal fluid was 14% of the plasma level 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Further human pharmacokinetic analysis studying the peak cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of irinotecan and its metabolite， SN-38， with changes in infusion duration may evaluate this hypothesis.\n\n【54】Conclusions\n\n【55】Irinotecan-associated dysarthria， as a rare adverse effect， was reported with all 3 patients during the drug administration. Neurological manifestations included changes in speech， dif-ficulty swallowing and enunciating words， and subjective re-marks of having a \"thick tongue.\" The onset of dysarthria ranged from 10 to 70 min. No long-term sequelae or progres-sion on CT scan were noted， and all cases were reversible us-ing various management measures， including increasing in-fusion time to 180 min and pausing infusion for 5 to 15 min followed by a re-challenge. Limitations of our study includ-ed the small number of patients in our series and the retro-spective study design. Prospective trials and pharmacokinetic studies are needed to validate the efficacy of extending infu-sion time to prevent irinotecan-associated dysarthria， as well as to identify probable pre-disposing factors.\n\n【56】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgment</u>\n\n【57】通用结尾删除-1:<u>I would like to thank the pharmacy team and WDMH staff for their cooperation and hard work.</u>\n\n【58】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of interest</u>\n\n【59】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

Although coagulation dys-function was reported to affect the severity of COVID-19， the association between pregnancy， which is usually accompanied by changes in coagulation function， and the worsening of COVID-19 is unknown. We present a case of a 30-year-old woman in the 36th week of pregnancy who was diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneu-monia and required postpartum extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy.\n\n【23】Case Report：\n\n【24】A 30-year-old， 36-weeks pregnant woman presented to our hospital and was diagnosed with severe COVID-19pneumonia soon after she had undergone a cesarean section. Her respiratory failure could not be managed by conventional therapeutic approaches. Therefore，ECMO was administered on day 7. Controlling coagulation function to maintain ECMO therapy was challenging. Nafamostat mesylate and cryoprecipitate were admin-istered to treat the hypercoagulative status and severe hypofibrinogenemia， respectively. Since coagulopathy and her respiratory state improved， the ECMO therapy was terminated on day 15.\n\n【25】Conclusions：\n\n【26】We report a case of severe COVID-19 pneumonia in a pregnant woman urgently treated with ECMO in the post-partum period. Thus， this case highlights the importance of close monitoring and appropriate medical care for pregnant women with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n【27】MeSH Keywords： COVID-19·Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation· Puerperal Infection\n\n【28】Abbreviations：\n\n【29】COVID-19- novel coronavirus disease 2019； SARS-CoV-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavi-rus； ECMO -extracorporeal membrane oxygenation； RT-PCR - reverse transcriptase polymerase chain re-action； ARDS - acute respiratory distress syndrome； ICU - Intensive Care Unit； HD- hospital day；ID- ill-ness day； PEEP- positive end-expiratory pressure； Fio，-fractional inspired oxygen concentration；\n\n【30】FIB -fibrinogen； FDP-fibrin-fibrinogen degradation products； APTT - activated partial thrombin time； INR -international normalized ratio； ACT - activated clotting time； PICS - post-intensive care syndrome\n\n【31】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/927521\n\n【32】22044 25\n\n【33】The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging disease caused by the novel coronavirus called“severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\"(SARS-CoV-2)， with a rapid increase in cases since its first identification in Wuhan， China， in December 2019 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. In Japan， since the first diagnosis of COVID-19 on January 16hh， 2020， the number of domestic pa-tients has gradually increased and resulted in 75 218 cases and 1439 deaths 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【34】Generally， pregnant women are at high risk of developing viral infections such as influenza-A， H1N1， severe acute respirato-ry syndrome coronavirus， and the Middle East respiratory syn-drome coronavirus. Reports have indicated that SARS-CoV-2is highly contagious and can be transmitted through droplets， which can trigger a cytokine storm and affect the function-ing of multiple organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>. Nonetheless， it has been suggest-ed that intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【35】According to reports from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Centers for Disease Control(CDC)， compared with non-pregnant women， pregnant wom-en with COVID-19 in the US are at increased risk for severe symptoms and are more likely to be admitted to the inten-sive care unit (1.5% versus 0.9%) and to require mechanical ventilation (0.5% versus 0.3%). This suggests that pregnant women with COVID-19 should undergo careful follow-up to enable close monitoring and adequate management if symp-toms become severe. Moreover， a large-population study in the United States reported that pregnancy with COVID-19 in-fection was associated with increased risk for ICU admission and administration of mechanical ventilation， but was not as-sociated with mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. In contrast， another large study， in the United Kingdom， reported an increased risk of mortality(1.0%)， stillbirth (1.2%)， and preterm delivery (24.8%) in preg-nant patients with COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>.\n\n【36】It was reported that clotting function changes dramatically during pregnancy and postpartum， and the coagulation ac-tivity is approximately double that before pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Moreover， several studies have reported the existence of a hypercoagulable state in severe COVID-19 that leads to mul-tiple organ dysfunction and high mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. These com-bined pathophysiologies related to coagulation disorder might result in worsening outcomes of pregnant COVID-19 patients. Nonetheless， there are few reports on COVID-19 in pregnant women. Here， we report the case of a 30-year-old woman in the 36th week of pregnancy who needed immediate postpar-tum extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy for severe COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n【37】A 30-year-old woman at 36 weeks of gestation presented with fever and cough to a nearby general hospital where she was scheduled for delivery. Her symptoms started with 1 day of fatigue， followed by intermittent fever (38.0℃) and cough for3 days. A nasopharyngeal swab test was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) running on the cobas 6800/8800 system and negative for other common respiratory viruses. She had no underlying diseases and all previous scheduled pregnan-cy screening test results were within normal limits. Her con-dition during diagnosis was relatively stable. She was diag-nosed with mild pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 and was subsequently admitted to the isolation room in a respiratory ward . She had a pulse of 104 beats/min， a blood pressure of 114/80 mmHg， a respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min， and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. On day 8 after the onset of symptoms， her respiratory condition worsened， and she developed mild acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> . Given the potential risks of impend-ing respiratory decompensation and subsequent severe fe-tal hypoxia， an emergency cesarean section under combined spinal and epidural anesthesia was performed. A preterm fe-male neonate weighing 2.56 kg was delivered uneventfully with an Apgar score of 8 (on day 8 after the onset of symp-toms). The neonate was placed in isolation and observed at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. The result of RT-PCR test-ing for SARS-CoV-2 in the neonate was negative， and no other complications were observed. Several hours after the cesarean section， the mother was transferred to the general Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and intubated. The next day， she was trans-ferred to our Emergency and Critical Care Center with a diag-nosis of severe COVID-19 pneumonia (hospital day 1， day 9after onset of symptoms).\n\n【38】The initial physical examination revealed alert conscious-ness with a Glasgow Coma Scale of E4VTM6， body tempera-ture of 37.7℃， blood pressure of 102/70 mmHg， pulse rate of92 beats/min， respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min， and oxygen saturation of 89% under the mechanical ventilation setting including positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 and fractional inspired oxygen concentration (FIO，) of 50%. Her initial arterial blood gas analysis showed： pH 7.359， Paco，of41.7 mmHg， PaO， of 59.8 mmHg， HCO，of 22.9 mmol/l， and lac-tate of 1.9 mmol/l， suggesting profound hypoxemia and mod-erate ARDS . Other coagulation laboratory findings included fibrinogen (FIB)， D-dimer， and fibrin-fibrinogen degra-dation products (FDP) of 422 mg/dl， 4.42 pg/ml， and 8.8 pg/ml， respectively.

In addition， tocilizumab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>， which is a suggested treatment op-tion for COVID-19， was administered at a dose of 480 mg ev-ery 24 h on hospital days 4 and 5.\n\n【41】Her oxygenation gradually worsened after 6 days (hospital day7)； arterial blood gas showed pH of 7.404， PaO， of 74.7 mmHg， PaCO， of 47.2 mmHg under the mechanical ventilator setting， tidal volume of 333 ml (5.8 ml/kg predicted body weight)，re-spiratory rate of 24 breaths/min， PEEP of 16， and Fl02 of 80%(severe ARDS and Murray score 3.5). In this setting， the plateau\n\n【42】pressure increased up to 35 cmH，O. Transthoracic echocardiog-raphy excluded cardiogenic pulmonary edema resulting from a massive pulmonary embolism.

Several studies have reported that pregnant women with viral respiratory illnesses are at higher risk than non-pregnant women of developing various complications， including critical ARDS and perinatal adverse outcomes， pos-sibly due to changes in the immune system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Previous studies have reported that fibrinogen and D-dimer elevation are associated with the severity of COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Moreover， it was reported that the fibrin level was elevated in the lungs of the COVID-19 patients， and excessive fibrin accumulation in the alveoli led to acute inflammation and pulmonary fibro-sis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. It was reported that the coagulation system during pregnancy is complex， and standard coagulation tests such as INR and APTT have reported normal or slightly hypercoagula-ble states； however， some clotting factors (such as fibrinogen，\n\n【52】factor VIII， IX， X， XIl， and von Willebrand factor) are reported to be more than 2-fold higher during pregnancy than before pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，20\\]</u>. A large study reported an increased risk of mortality， stillbirth， and preterm delivery in pregnant patients with COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>. Therefore， it was speculated that preg nancy can affect the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia due to abnormalities in clotting function.\n\n【53】We encountered several challenging issues， especially in con-trolling the coagulation function to maintain ECMO therapy， although the relationship between coagulopathy and preg-nancy was unclear. During ECMO therapy， nafamostat mesyl-ate， which was reported to have increased in usage as a sub-stitute for heparin because of its very short half-life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> and thus potentially applicable for the treatment of COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>， was used in addition to high-dose heparin to maintain ACT and APTT within the therapeutic range. However， the pres-ent case showed severe hypofibrinogenemia， possibly caused by administration of coagulation factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>， tissue plasmin-ogen activator-induced hyperfibrinolysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>， or both， which can cause severe hemorrhage. Considering the risk of exces-sive fluid overload and lung edema， we used cryoprecipitate instead of fresh frozen plasma to prevent hemorrhagic com-plications related to COVID-19\\[13，14.\n\n【54】Additionally， in this case， the timing and the anesthesia ap-proach for cesarean section were considered to be debatable. The possibility of vertical transmission during vaginal deliv-ery remains unknown， and COVID-19 itself is not an indication for immediate cesarean section. However， emergency cesar-ean section should be performed if there is intrauterine fetal distress caused by hypoxia or other reasons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>， as was ob served in this case. To this end， multidisciplinary evaluation by an obstetrician， pulmonary physician， and an intensivist， would be required. Regarding the anesthetic approach， both neuraxial and general anesthesia have been reported to be safe in pregnant patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. However， a study recommend-ed that cesarean section under regional anesthesia should be avoided in COVID-19 patients with respiratory symptoms or hypoxemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>， since regional anesthesia could cause hypo-tension， possibly due to activation of angiotensin-converting enzyme Il receptor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. As our patient had already developed ARDS prepartum， cesarean section under general anesthesia with intubation and mechanical ventilation might have been a therapeutic option， with possible benefit from changes in cardiopulmonary physiology.\n\n【55】The relationship between pregnancy and the worsening of COVID-19 cannot be discussed without epidemiologic com-parison； however， in addition to a previous report of pregnant COVID-19 cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>， the present case has some remarkable implications regarding the progressive nature of COVID-19 in\n\n【56】References：\n\n【57】1\\.

Although surgical and catheter-based revascularization of ischemic myocardium can restore blood flow， improve perfusion， reduce clinical symptoms， and aug ment function of viable myocardium， the viability of severely ischemic myocardium， necrotic myocardium， or both cannot be restored. In some patients， cardiac transplantation may be an option， but because of the organ shortage and need for im-munosuppression therapy， its practical use is limited.\n\n【30】Cell therapy has recently emerged as a promising strategy for end-stage heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. Many publications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-8\\]</u> have demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of intramyocardial transplantation of autologous skeletal myoblasts for myocardi-al repair and functional improvement in experimental animals. The results of experimental studies encouraged Abraham et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> to perform the first autologous skeletal myoblast trans-plantation in a patient， a survivor of myocardial infarction， dur-ing CABG. We investigated the safety of this treatment in a canine heart model.

Therefore， starting in December 2002，we began a clinica. trial in patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10-12\\]</u>. Here， we present the 9-year follow-up results of a patient who received autologous skele-tal myoblast transplantation because of serious coronary heart disease. No ventricular tachyarrhythmias were detected after treatment. The patient had another myocardial infarction in April 2012 and was treated successful with PCI. Our results demonstrate the safety and efficacy of this treatment in isch-emic myocardial patients.\n\n【31】Case Report\n\n【32】In December 2002， a 63-year-old man with hypertension his-tory was admitted with chest pain lasting more than 2 days to our hospital emergency department. He had no history of smoking or diabetes mellitus. He had been experiencing chest discomfort during slight exercise during the previous 3 months. Troponin T levels were 0.17 U/ml (normal <0.1 u/ml). An elec-trocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm with ST elevation over leads Il， Ill， and aVF， revealing acute inferior myocardial infarction. He was admitted to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction and re-fractory heart failure (New York Heart Association class III). Echocardiographic left-ventricular mean ejection fraction (LVEF)\n\n【33】was 48%， with severe posterior wall hypokinesia. Coronary an-giography was performed 7 days later， after medical treatment. Tight stenosis in the left main coronary artery， serious anteri-or trigeminal lesions ， and serious stenosis at the proximal right coronary artery (RCA) were detected . These findings were a clear indication for myocardial revas-cularization. Because of the tight stenosis of multi-branches artery lesions， we decided to optimize the effects of bypass surgery by myoblast transplantation in his left ventricular pos-terior myocardium to improve heart function. This procedure was approved by our institutional review board. The patient received extensive information on the procedure and subse-quently gave his written informed consent.\n\n【34】A skeletal muscle biopsy was obtained， and myoblasts were iso-lated and grown in in vitro cell culture， as previously described通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. Three weeks after the biopsy sample was taken， the pa-tient underwent CABG surgery. A saphenous vein (SV)， divid-ed into 3 parts， was grafted with the LAD， LCX， and posterior descending artery (PDA) of the RCA. The area of scar was then easily visualized on the left ventricular posterior wall. A total of 1.2x106 skeletal myoblast cells divided into 10 suspensions were injected into and around the scar area while the heart still under hypothermic cardioplegia. The needle holes were sealed with fibrin glue before reversal of hypothermic cardiac arrest. No bleeding occurred from the puncture sites. No ven-tricular tachyarrhythmias were detected after treatment with bypass surgery and skeletal myoblast implantation during the hospitalization period. The patient had an uneventful recov-ery and was discharged 9 days after surgery.\n\n【35】At 6-month follow-up， the patient's clinical status improved， and he had stable New York Association class Il disease. He was pre-scribed aspirin， clopidogrel， beta-blocker， and captopril. There were no substantia. arrhythmias on 24-h Holter recordings. Echocardiographic studies showed a slight (2%) increase of LVEF.\n\n【36】At 4-year follow-up， the patient felt no chest discomfort and lived successfully by himself. He was routinely taking aspi-rin， beta-blocker， and captopril. In April 11， 2012， he sud-denly felt chest pain again and 10 days later he came to our hospital. Pathologic Q waves were determined in ll， Ill， and aVF leads on ECG. Troponin T levels were slightly increased. Echocardiographic studies showed LVEF 57% with severe infe-rior wall hypokinesia and 24-h Holter monitoring found no ven-tricular tachyarrhythmias. CAG was performed and examina-tion resu lts showed the RCA was totally occluded . A Runthrough@NS guidewire (Terumo Company， Europe) was eas-ily and successfully annulated through the occlude RCA， which indicating the artery was recently occluded. After the occluded RCA was re-opened，3.0x29mm and 3.0x18 mm Firebird 2si-rolimus-eluting stents (Microport Company， China) were suc-cessfully implanted in the RCA . No complications\n\n【37】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1. Coronary angiography showing a significant lesion in left coronary artery (A) and RCA (B).</u>\n\n【38】occurred during hospitalization. He remains free of angina symptoms and continues to do well at 3-month clinical fol-low-up. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel for at least 1 year was suggested.\n\n【39】Discussion\n\n【40】Myocardial infarction is the leading cause of death among peo-ple in industrialized nations. Although the heart has some ability to regenerate after infarction， myocardial restoration is inade-quate. Consequently， cardiovascular investigators are current-ly exploring the use of stem cells， including skeletal myoblasts， adult bone marrow stem cells， and cardiac progenitor cells， as possible new regenerative treatments for patients with myo-cardial infarction and heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Skeletal myoblasts local-ize at the basal lamina of the adult skeletal muscle and main-tain the regenerative potential of the muscle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Because they\n\n【41】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2. Coronary angiography before PTCA (A) and after stenting showing TIMI 3 flow and minimal residual stenosis in RCA (B).</u>\n\n【42】are natural skeletal myocyte precursors， they have a relative-ly good proliferative potential under appropriate culture con-ditions， an advanced stage of differentiation accounting for a myogenic-restricted lineage commitment and high resistance to ischemia， and a capacity to differentiate into myocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The possible use of autologous skeletal myoblast cells in clin-ical conditions is attractive because it avoids the need for im-munosuppression， the shortage of donor tissue， and the ethical dilemmas associated with the use of embryonic cells. Very re-cent reports in patients with myocardial infarction have shown that autologous skeletal myoblasts can survive after transplan-tation and form viable grafts in heavily scarred human myo-cardial tissue， thus providing a proof of principle.\n\n【43】The feasibility and efficacy of intramyocardial transplantation of autologous skeletal myoblasts for myocardial repair and functional improvement in experimental animals has been\n\n【44】demonstrated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The results of experimental studies encour-aged Menasche et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> to perform the first autologous skel-etal myoblast transplantation in a patient， a survivor of myo-cardial infarction， during CABG. We investigated the safety of this treatment in a canine heart model. Echocardiographic evaluation of cardiac function， blood tests， and local histo-logical findings of heart muscle did not demonstrate any evi-dence of systemic or local toxicity induced by this treatment in the acute or chronic phases. Therefore， we began a clinical trial of autologous skeletal myoblast transplantation for CAD patients， starting in December 2002 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. We believe this is the longest follow-up of patient with coronary heart disease who had received autologous skeletal myoblast transplanta-tion. In this 9-year follow-up case study， we found that trans-plantation of autologous skeletal myoblast cells in patients with depressed LV function because of CAD improved signifi-cantly and remain remarkably stable over time， which is most likely because of cell transplantation.\n\n【45】Arrhythmic risk potentially represents a fundamental limita-tion of cell replacement therapy. Using a unique， state-of-the-art optical mapping system， Abraham MR et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> examined the electrophysiological effects of skeletal myoblast integra-tion within a 2-D array of cardiac myocytes. They found that\n\n【46】References：\n\n【47】1\\. Zhang F， Yang Z， Chen Y et al： Clinical cellular cardiomyoplasty： technical considerations. J Card Surg， 2003； 18通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>：268-73\n\n【48】2\\.

Arrhythmic risk has also been ob-served in human clinical trials. Although the baseline arrhythmic risk in these patients is high， potentially obscuring any effect of replacement cells， trials involving skeletal myoblasts show increased risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmias 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The risk seems highest early after transplantation. However， the mechanisms of these presumed arrhythmias still remain to be elucidated， complicated by the lack of appropriate preclinical models and the fact that the underlying heart failure itself pre-disposes patients to rhythm abnormalities. However， it is very interesting that no ventricular tachyarrhythmias were detect-ed after treatment with bypass surgery and skeletal myoblast implant during 9-year follow-up in this patient.\n\n【53】Conclusions\n\n【54】In conclusion， our results suggest that autologous skeletal myo-blast transplantation with bypass surgery is associated with improvement in cardiac function and lack of adverse effects， thus resulting in a promising therapy for patients with heart failure.

Although commonly encountered in clini-cal practice， it rarely presents with extensive ossification and few cases have been described in the literature.\n\n【29】Casa Report：\n\n【30】Herein， we describe the case of a 51-year-old man who presented to clinical attention for persistent right na-sal obstruction. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRl) and computed tomography (CT) scans of the facial bones showed a lobated lesion with ossification occupying most of the right nasal cavity. The lesion was removed by endoscopic sinus surgery， leaving the surrounding bone structures intact. On pathological examination， mature bone tissue was found within an inverted papilloma. The pathologist contacted the surgeon， who confirmed that no healthy bone tissue was removed during the procedure. Therefore， a diagnosis of inverted papilloma with ossification could be made without the use of ancillary techniques.\n\n【31】Conclusions：\n\n【32】Inverted papilloma with ossification is a common lesion with a rare feature.

Herein， we report a case of ossifying IP arising in the right nasal cavi-ty of an otherwise healthy 51-year-old man. A particular focus will be placed upon differential diagnosis and multidisciplinary teamwork， which was of great value in the presence of a com-mon lesion with a striking although rare feature.\n\n【36】Case Report\n\n【37】A 51-year-old man presented with monolateral right nasal ob-struction， which had reportedly been present for some months. The worsening of this symptom led him to the attention of an Ear-Nose-Throat specialist， whose clinical evaluation sug-gested for a polypoid lesion of the right ethmoid sinus. The presence of a lesion was confirmed by a CT scan of the facial bones， which described a solid ossifying lesion occupying most of the right nasal cavity. Erosion of the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone， septal deviation， and partial dislocation of the medial wall of the right maxillary sinus were also described. On a subsequent MRI， the lesion proved to be hy-perintense on T2-weighted images and showed marked con-trast enhancement . Based on these findings， en-doscopic sinus surgery (ESS) was performed. On endoscopic examination， the lesion appeared to originate from the eth-moid bone， engulfing the middle nasal concha， and was firm and hard on manipulation. Antero-posterior ethmoidectomy\n\n【38】was performed and the lesion removed. After surgical remov-al， lamina papiracea， cribriform plate， and other bone surfac-es of the nasal cavity appeared intact and lined by normal mucosa. A frozen section of the lesion was performed， which showed chronically inflamed respiratory mucosa with foci of squamous metaplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【39】The remaining lesion was fixed in 10% neutral buffered for-malin and sent for definitive examination. On macroscopic ex-amination， the lesion was described as multiple fragments of bony tissue covered by grayish mucosa with a somewhat gelat-inous appearance， whose greatest dimension ranged between0.6 and 3.5 cm. After overnight decalcification， the lesion was sampled in 12 blocks， which were then processed and embed-ded in paraffin. H&E-stained 3-um-thick slides revealed an in-verted papilloma with extensive ossification .\n\n【40】Discussion\n\n【41】Inverted papilloma (IP) is a non-cancerous sinonasal tumor that mostly affects middle-aged men. It accounts for approximately0.5-4% of all nasal tumors and is most frequently encountered in patients aged 40-60 years， with a significant predilection for males (M： F ratio from 3： 1 to 5：1)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16，17\\]</u>. IP most commonly occurs on the lateral wall of the nasal cavity， most frequent-ly originating from the middle turbinate/middle meatus and maxillary ostium， although it can arise elsewhere in the nasal passage. As the mass enlarges， it results in bony remodeling and resorption. Extension into the maxillary antrum is a com-mon event 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Due to its non-specific clinical presentation， with symptoms such as nasal obstruction and chronic sinus-itis， the diagnostic process relies heavily on radiology， with CT and MRI scan of the facial bones as criterion standard first-line procedures. On CT scan， IP presents as a solid lobulated lesion causing opacification of the involved nasal cavities or sinuses. Bone involvement is common， in the form of thinning or erosion of bony structures and septal deviation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. MRI is slightly more specific than CT and reveals the following typi-cal features： isointense signal on T2-weighted images (T2WI) and so-called“cerebriform” configuration both on T2 and en-hanced T1WI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，19\\]</u>. Due to extensive bone involvement and to the possibility of malignant transformation， radical surgi-cal excision is mandatory， and is often achieved by endoscopic procedures. Definitive diagnosis is based on pathological ex-amination. On histology， IP typically presents as ribbons and nests of respiratory，transitional， and/or squamous epithelium with smooth outer contours. As suggested by its name，endo-phytic growth of the epithelium into the stroma is a striking feature，which may be misinterpreted as invasion， leading to an incorrect diagnosis of carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Although calcifica-tion has been described in up to 52% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>，mature bone formation and ossification are rare events in IP. To date， less\n\n【42】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

Conventional and enhanced MRI manifes-tations of 20 ossifying IPs and eight polyps， which were con-firmed histopathologically， were retrospectively evaluated by two doctors majoring in head and neck imaging with a signifi-cant difference was detected between the two entities for the involved sites. The largest case series has been published by Yang et al， who investigated the CT and MRI features of 20 IPs with ossification and 8 ossifying sinonasal polyps， with a focus\n\n【44】on their main differential diagnosis such as osteoma， ossify-ing fibroma， fibrous dysplasia， and calcified fungal balls 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In our case， the patient presented with a months-long history of right nasal obstruction， unaccompanied by other symptoms such as pain or fever， thus raising the suspicion of sinonasal polyps or chronic sinusitis. A CT scan of the facial bones was performed and revealed a solid ossified lesion almost entire-ly filling the right nasal cavity， with signs of bone erosion in the ethmoid region and nasal septum deviation. A subsequent\n\n【45】MRI showed hyperintensity on T2Wl， which， as previously de-scribed， is not a typical feature of IPs. Differential diagnosis included a sinonasal malignancy， a benign lesion with depo-sition of bone tissues such as osteoma， and a fibrous dyspla-sia of the facial bones. Due to the lack of specificity of these findings， a definitive diagnosis could not be reached on the basis of clinical and radiological data. Despite this uncertain-ty， the lesion was considered amenable to complete surgical resection， and the patient underwent endoscopic sinus sur-gery (ESS). During the procedure， the surgeon noticed that the lesion was hard and firm， suggesting the diagnosis of fi-brous dysplasia of the bone or osteoma. After successful re-moval of the mass， all nasal bone surfaces appeared smooth and intact on inspection. A frozen section was also performed on a sample， but failed to provide a diagnosis， revealing only inflamed respiratory epithelium with foci of squamous meta-plasia. On final examination， histology revealed an inverted papilloma characterized by a striking amount of mature bone tissue arranged in trabeculae within the stroma. This feature was so remarkable that the pathologist directly consulted the surgeon， asking whether normal bone tissue of the nasal cav-ity structures was sacrificed in order to remove the lesion in its entirety. Once a negative answer was provided， a definitive diagnosis of inverted sinonasal papilloma with multiple foci of heterotopic ossification could be made. Common lesions with rare features may be very difficult to diagnose and in this re-gard our case can be paradigmatic. IP should be kept in mind when a monoliteral sinonasal lesion with extensive ossifica-tion is evaluated on CT and MRl. Indeed， IPs have non-specif-ic features on imaging， and heterotopic ossification is so un-usual that the correct diagnosis could be easily missed， if not ruled out， in the presence of such a feature. Luckily， IP is readily recognizable on histology， and a definitive diagnosis was pos-sible on H& E slides without the use of ancillary techniques. In this context， communication between specialists again proved to be of fundamental importance in providing the correct di-agnosis. The identification of mature bone as heterotopic os-sification instead of normal facial bone structures was possi-ble only with direct communication between specialists. The radiologist identified a lesion with massive bone deposition，\n\n【46】References：\n\n【47】1\\. Lawson W， Ho BT， Shaari CM， Biller HF.

Mycoplasmal infection has been proposed for the etiology of KD but was not proved.\n\n【10】Case Report：\n\n【11】We report a case of KD coexistent with Mycoplasma preuorice infection， complicated by myocarditis and renal failure. A 12-year-old boy was admitted with high fever and maculopapular rash. He had nonpurulent conjunctival injection， redness on cheeks， erythema of oral mucosa with cracked lips， strawberry tongue and diffuse polymorphic maculopapular eruptions and bilateral crepitations oflungs. High C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were striking onlaboratory work-up. He developed prerenal acute renal failure， myocarditis， pericardial and pleural effusions on right side of the thorax with normal blood pressure. The pleural fluid was exudative and chest-tube thoracostomy was placed. His microbiological investigations were all negative except Mycoplasma pneumonide immunoglobulin M positivity. He received appropriate antibiotherapy. The patient was still febrile and KD was diagnosed because of typical concomitant characteristic features. His fever dis appeared afted intravenous immunoglubulin and aspirin therapy. Typical desquamation of hands was observed later on. Coronary arteries were not involved at follow-up. He is still without problems at the end of one-year follow-up.\n\n【12】Concluslons：\n\n【13】These two diseas es have been documented rarely in the same patient at the same time.

The diagnosis is established primarily on exclusion of other genuine etiologies causing the similar clinical presentation and fulfilling the following criteria. These include fever lasting for 25 days and at least four of the following features： polymorphous exanthem， bi-lateral nonpurulent conjunctival injection， changes in the lips or oral cavity， edema and erythema ofthe extremities and cervical lymphadenopathy. The most serious complications of the disease include inflam-mation of coronary arteries leading to aneurysm， thrombosis and rupture. Pulmonary manifestations通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-4\\]</u> and development of acute renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>have been documented sporadically during the course.\n\n【24】The etiology of KD remains unknown， although clini-cal and epidemiological data support an infectious cause. However， conventional bacterial and viral cultures and serologic investigations have failed to yield a causative agent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a respiratory pathogen observed in all pediatric age groups， but mainly seen after five years of age. The microorganism can lead to diverse clinical picture including arthritis， cardiac involvement， exanthematous rash and meningoen-\n\n【26】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

M. pneumoniae infection has been pro-posed for the etiology of KD but was not proved and the coexistence of two disorder has been reported rarely 7-91. We present a case where these diseases coexist together in the same patient.\n\n【28】CASE REPORT\n\n【29】A previously healthy 12-year-old boy with only a his-tory of adenotonsillectomy operation in the past and normal developmental milestones presented to our hospital with fever of 40°C for four days， abdominal pain and nonspesific maculopapular pink rash starting from the feet and spreading all over the body. He had received intramuscular penicillin therapy for three days prior to hospitalization. Physical examination revealed axillary temperature of 38.5°C， nonpuru-lent conjunctival injection， a butterfly redness on cheeks， erythema of oral mucosa with cracked lips， strawberry tongue and diffuse polymorphic maculo-papular eruptions . His blood pressure was normal. He had bilateral crepitations on lung auscultation， no lymphadenopathy， no abnor-malities in cardiovascular system and also abdominal examination was unremarkable on admission to our hospital.\n\n【30】Initial laboratory studies were as follows： white blood cell (WBC) count 8，600/uL with a preponderance for neutrophils (84%)， haemoglobin 11.3 g/L， plate-let count 151，000/uL， erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 57 mm/h， C-reactive protein (CRP) 144mg/L. Serum electrolytes， liver and kidney function test were unremarkable. Urinalysis was also normal. He had bilateral reticular images on chest radio-graph. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 65%and mild mitral regurgitation was demonstrated by echocardiogram.\n\n【31】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2. Diffuse polymorphic maculopapular eruptions.</u>\n\n【32】His parvovirus B19， Epstein-Barr virus， coxsackie A and B virus， cytomegalovirus， herpes simplex virus， adenovirus， chlamydia， Brucella and Rickettsia se-rologies were all negative. He was treated as acute mycoplasmal infection because of clinical features and clarithromycin was given with a dose of 15mg/kg/day. At the 48-72th hours of follow-up， he had oliguria and edema on hands and feet in addition to fever which had continued. His breath sounds were diminished on right lower chest and cardiac sounds were muffled. Serum sodium was 126 mEq/L， potas-sium 3.1 mEq/L， urea 75 mg/dL，creatinine 1.7 mg/dL with no abnormality in other biochemical tests. Chest roentgenogram and computed tomography showed pleural effusion and small atelectatic areas on right lung. On thoracentesis pleural fluid was clear and xanthochromic in appearence， glucose 121 mg/dL， protein 1736 mg/L， lactic dehydrogenase 141 IO/L， Gram stain showed abundant neutrophils.Chest-tube thoracostomy was needed in addition to intravenous teicoplanin therapy with a suspection of overwhelming staphylococcal infection. He also had minimal peri-cardial effusion， mitral and tricuspid regurgitations， mHo right ventricular pressure 35 mmHg and decreased ejection fraction on echocardiogram. Complicating myocarditis and dilated cardiyomyopathy with resul-tant hypervolemia and prerenal acute renal failure(ARF) was diagnosed. The patient received appropri-ate fluid therapy in addion to furosemide， dobutamine and captopril. Oliguria resolved， although edema at dorsum of hands and feet remained， and renal re-placement therapy was not required.\n\n【33】Chest tube drainage lasted for three days. He also experienced pleural effusion on left side that with no need of drainage. Nonspecific bacterial cultures of blood， pharyngeal， urine and pleural fluid were all negative on seventh day and teikoplanin was stopped. On tenth day，the result ofthe test for M. pneumoniae immunoglobulin M (IgM) was available and it was pos-itive by ELISA method (Platelia-Sanofi Diagnostica Pasteur). Polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) test of nasopharyngeal aspirate for M. pneumoniae was negative on 14h day of follow-up. Systemic lupus ery-thematosus was considered in differential diagnosis because of multisystemic involvement. This diagnosis was excluded as the autoantibodies were negative， C3 and C4 complement levels and skin biopsy were normal. Bone marrow aspiration exluded the mac-rophage activation syndrome.\n\n【34】On fourth day of the admission， KD was diagnosed because of fever lasting for more than five days unresponsive to antibiotic therapy， nonpurulent conjunctivitis， strawberry tounge and lip changes， polymorphic rash and changes of distal extremities.\n\n【35】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3. Typical desquamation of fingers.</u>\n\n【36】His platelet count rose to 510，000/mm'and ESR to81 mm/hour during the course of disease. He was treated with 2 gr/kg IVIG and high-dose aspirin(daily 100 mg/kg)， also resultant resolving fever within48 hours. Typical desquamation of fingers occured at the end of first week after the diagnosis of KD and aspirin was given at an antiaggregant dose after the second week. There was no evidence of coronary artery involvement at any time. All the laboratory and echocardiographic data returned to normal. He is still without problems at the end of one-year follow-up.\n\n【37】DISCUSSION\n\n【38】Kawasaki disease is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children in developed countries.The diversity of clinical manifestations on admission is a result of multisystemic involvement. Although clinical and epidemiologic features strongly suggest an infec-tious cause， the etiology remains unknown 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.Many pathogens， including Mycoplasma， have been accused but there is no definitely documented causative mi-crmobiologic agent to date. The affected children are mmostly young ones； 80% are younger than 5 years of age and KD is unusual after 12 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.On the other hand， pneumonia due to M. pneumoniae has been documented to have the highest incidence between 10-14 years of age. Our case was in an age range typical for M. pneumoniae， although his age通用删除7(英):<u>(12)</u> is at a证nl UuInlusual age for KD presentation.\n\n【39】Mucocutaneous manifestations in M. preumoniae infection are protean； including conjunctivitis. The presented case had been considered as KD on admis-sion due to high fever for four days， maculopapular rash， strawberry tounge， mild anemia and high acute phase reactants but the patient fulfilled the criteria for diagnosis inadequately. Furthermore IgM for M. pneumoniae was detected as positive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. On the other hand， the PCR test for M. pneumoniae was nega-tive because it was sought too late in the course of the\n\n【40】disease that it had became negative in nasopharynx. Rapidly progressive multisystemic involvement like pleurisy， pericarditis， myocarditis and acute renal failure strongly suggest a probable coexisting KD.On the other hand ARF due to M. pneumoniae infection and a need for hemodialysis has been reported to be extremely rarely 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Acute renal failure during the course of KD has also been documented rarely and suggested to be due to fluid imbalance， insufficiency of myocardial function reserve， or myoglobinuria dur-ing high fever 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13， 14\\]</u>. Our patient responded quickly to appropriate electrolyte and fluid therapy together with cardiotonic support； a renal biopsy was not ap-plied， as in some cases in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【41】Being a multisystemic vasculitic syndrome， KD can appear in a variety of pictures. Damage to coronary arteries is the most frightening complication and primarily responsible for mortality related to disease. Pericardial effusion， cardiomyopathy and conges-tive heart failure are other cardiac manifestations. Myocardial inflammation has been documented in 50-70% of patients using scintigraphic methods 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【42】Inflammation ofserous membranes including pleural effusion is a rare complication of KD. It has been postulated that lung changes are due to interstitial pneumonitis，lower respiratory tract inflammation and pulmonary arteritis， although the exact mechanism is unknown 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. More recently， it has been linked to elevated vascular endothelial growth factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Pleural effusion can be large and even need surgical interven-tion. Chronic interstitial pneumonitis was reported in a case with pleural effusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.Other radiological findings in children with KD have been reported as being reticulonodular pattern， peribronchial cuffing， atelectasis and air trapping 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【43】Pleural effusion due to mycoplasma infection are reported in 20% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Pleurisy concomit-tant with pericarditis and myocarditis on the third day of admission was evaluated as infectious since the diagnosis of KD was not established yet.\n\n【44】High fever， exanthem， eye and mouth changes， myo-carditis， pleurisy， hematologic and renal involvement\n\n【45】REFERENCES：\n\n【46】1\\.

But IVIG therapy has some limita-tions in practice such as a risk of adverse reactions， the need for intravenous cannulation， concern for possible adventitious agents， interference with the immune response to live vaccines， expense， and the fact that 2-4% oftreated children still develop coro-nary artery disease 6\\].\n\n【51】Although M. preumoniae is not in the repertoire of superantigen-producing bacteria， its relation to Mycoplasma arthritidis suggests yet an undefined superantigen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【52】As far as we know， there have been only three cases reported as the development of KD during the course of a respiratory infection due to M. pneumoniae 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-9\\]</u>. The diagnosis of KD， as in the third case reported by Merlin et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， has been postulated on admission but the development of pleural effusion in addition to myocarditis and acute renal failure diverted us initially from this diagnosis. The lasting high fever in addition to other clinical features， dramatic response to high dose immune globulin therapy and desquamation of fingers later on confirmed the diagnosis of KD in our patient. This emphasises the fact that high suspicion of KD should be kept even when there seems to be other etiologies for clinical presentation and that the hardness ofearly and correct diagnosis of KD before five-days course of fever has not lasted.\n\n【53】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【54】We report the coexistence of Mycoplasma infection and KD. The possibility of an early phase of KD should be taken into account during the course of Mycoplasma infection in cases in which the initial manifestations of infection are together with that of of vasculitis. This consideration should facilitate ap-propriate and urgent therapy， therefore can prevent coronary lesions in KD.\n\n【55】4\\. Hamada H， Terai M， Honda T， Kohno Y.

The quickly treat-ment based on angina pectoris symptoms may result in fatal consequence. The preliminary diversity of this pathology was very difficult particularly without magnetic resonance (MRI).

It is believed that the factors predisposing to SEH are clotting disturbances， vascular anomalies， discopathy， Paget\\`s disease， spinal diseases and probably arterial hypertension通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3，4\\]</u>. A typical and in fact the only symptom of increasing heamorrhaging to the spinal cord is abrupt back pain； neurological symptoms often develop several hours later. For these reasons prompt and proper diagnosis of SEH is not easy， especially if MRI is not available. Therefore SEH is often diagnosed when neurological lesions have developed， which hinders appropriate management. Special problems are connected with bleeding to the thoracic spinal cord， particularly when the first symptom is thoracic pain radiating to the neck and upper limbs， which is deceptively similar to the symptoms of ischaemic heart disease. Prompt differendiation of the disease and institution of appropriate management is likely to decide not only about the patient\\`s health but also his/her life.\n\n【25】The aim of the present paper was to analyse spon-taneous epidural haematoma in the thoracic region in a patient admitted to the hospital with the diagnosis of unstable coronary disease.\n\n【26】CASE REPORT\n\n【27】A 47-year-old patient was admitted to the hospital with the diagnosis of arterial hypertension accom-panied by retrosternal pain radiating to the neck and left arm. Till the day his complaints occurred the patient had not been treated for any other systemic diseases. On admission the patient complained of mild dyspnoea and general malaise. Due to the symptoms characteristic of coronary disease he was subjected to the examinations to confirm myocardial ischaemia， which revealed： creatynine - kinase (CK)1888U/l (n：24-195)， muscle -brain creatynin - kinase(CKMB) 17.1U/(n：0.0-25)， cardiac troponin 0.09ug/1(n：0.0-0.1)， ASPAT 190/ (n：0.42)， ALAT 18 (n：10-40). The remaining examinations performed also did not show any significant abnormalities. Since the com-plaints were not specific and myocardial ischaemia was not confirmed the patient was under observation at the Cardiology Department. During this obser-vation periodic， frequent rises inarterial blood pressurewere observed - upto200/110mmHg(26.26/14.14kPa). On the 3nd hospitalization day abrupt symptoms of tetraplegia developed accom-panied by neurological shock. The patient\\`s clinical\n\n【28】state markedly aggravated and he was referred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) where after neurological consultation and stabilization of his general condition MRI of the thoracic spinal cord was performed. The examination visualized epidural haematoma located in the C，-Th， segment with the symptoms of slight spinal compression. The extent of haematoma and neurological condition were accurately assessed and the patient was qualified for conservative treatment and further observation. The treatment consisted of：methylprednisolone infusions (Solu Medrol， Upjon， USA)， baclofel (Baclofel， Polfa， Pl)， tetrazepam(Myolastan Sanofi Winthrop)， ascorbic acid (Vit.C， Polfa， Pl) and wide antibiotic therapy. The patient\\`s condition gradually got normalized， however motor functions of the upper and lower limbs were not restored. The follow-up MR examinations (on the14th， 35th and 52nd day of hospitalization) showed gradual resorption of haematoma. After 90 days the patient was discharged and further rehabilitation was recommended.\n\n【29】DISCUSSION\n\n【30】A relatively low incidence of SEH in the thoracic region as well as its clinical picture very similar to coronary disease is likely to constitute an extreme hazard for the patient. According to Holtas et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> SEH occurs in 1/1000 000/vear cases， which hinders promt and proper diagnosis. What is worse， according to Fukui et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>SEH in the thoracic region occurs in25% of all cases! On the other hand， the similarity to the above-mentioned diseases may lead to the sus picion of unstablee coronaryCdisease or even myocardial infarction and thus to standard fibrinolytic treatment applied in such cases. Therefore it is dif ficult to define the management rules in the discussed case. It seems， however， that the only symptom weighing in favour of the diagnosis different than coronary disease was the lack of biochemical features of myocardial ischaemia， although the latter couldn\\`t have been fully excluded. The treatment of choice should be then urgent coronography although lack of conclusively confirmed myocardial damageand coronary disease would suggest planned examination.\n\n【31】Should the examination for SEH be performed urgently in such cases? Probably the answer may be“yes” because MRI of the spinal canal is likely to visualize any lesions in the initial stage of the disease. Many authors emphasize advantages of MRI in the diagnosis and control of SEH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，5-7\\]</u>. It may be supposed that lack of neurological symptoms and periodically increasing sternocardial complaints may rather suggest ischaemic heart disease. Moreover， the\n\n【32】rises in arterial blood pressure in our case seem relevant as they also might have suggested some heart condtion. It is not difficult to imagine the effects of full， standard treatment of ischaemic heart disease. On the other hand， it is widely known that early treatment in the cases of ischaemic heart disease -especially fibrinolytic treatment gives beneficial results. It seems that a wait-and-see attitude in our case was right. Should， however， the operative pro-cedure have been performed once proper diagnosis was established? It is difficult to find an explicit answer to this question. Many authors stress the advantages of conservative treatment of SEH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，8，9\\]</u> According to Torres et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> surgical treatment is ben-eficial only during the first day following first symptoms of SEH； later this pathology should be treated conservatively. Duffil et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> who analysed 4cases of SEH also emphasize beneficial effects of con-ventional treatment with necessary observation of the\n\n【33】REFERENCES\n\n【34】1\\.

The conservative treatment was also applied in the discussed case although abrupt development of tetraplegia might have suggested decompressive laminectomy. It is difficult， however， to define the onset of SEH in our case. It seems that the first symptoms observed on admission resulted from the bleeding to the spinal cord and tetraplegia was not the SEH onset. It may be assumed that the diagnostic procedure in this case was appropriate although earlier MRI was likely to enable much earlier diagnosis of SEH， which would probably allow us to avoid tetraplegia.\n\n【46】CONCLUSION\n\n【47】Spontaneousepidural haematoma in the cervi-cothoracic region may be suggestive of coronary disease.

The investment law approved recently has good statements and rules on the above strategy in particular to pharmacy regulations. Under the pressure of the new privatisation policy， the government introduced radical changes in the pharmacy regulations. To improve the effectiveness of the public pharmacy， resources should be switched towards areas of need， reducing inequalities and promoting better health conditions. Medicines are financed either through cost sharing or fully private. The role of the private services is significant. A review of the reform of financing medicines in Sudan is given in this study. Also， it highlights the current drug supply system in the public sector， which is currently the responsibility of the Central Medical Supplies Public Corporation (CMS). In Sudan， the researchers did not identify any rigorous evaluations or quantitative studies about the impact of drug regulations on the quality of medicines and how to protect public health against counterfeit or low-quality medicines， although it is practically possible. However， the regulations must be continually evaluated to ensure the public health is protected against by high-quality marketing medicines rather than commercial interests， and the drug companies are held accountable for their conduct.\n\n【4】KEYWORDS Counterfeits medicines， drug importers， quality of medicines， regulatory authorities Sudan， Healthcare， Medicines， Regulatory authorities，Pharmacy Management.\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】The World Health Organisation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> has defined drug regulation as a process， which encompasses various activities， aimed at promoting and protecting public health by ensuring the safety， efficiency and quality of drugs， and appropriateness accuracy of information 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

To assure the quality of medicines， in most countries registration is required before the introduction of a drug preparation in the market. The manufac-turing， registration and sale of drugs have been the subject of restricts regulations and administrative procedures worldwide for decades 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Nobody would seriously argue drugs should be proven to be 100% safe. No set of regulations could achieve that goal argue， because it is impossible and all drugs carry some risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Stringent drug regulation was introduced across many coun-tries in the 1960s following the thalidomide disaster and had since been embraced by the industry as an essential commercial seal of safety and quality 5\\]. In spite of the measures， many countries， especially developing one face a broader range of problems. In several developing countries drug quality is a source of concern. There is a general feeling of the high inci-dence of drug preparations that are not of acceptable quality通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. For example， about 70% of counterfeit medicines were re-ported by developing countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Reports from Asia， Africa，\n\n【14】and South America indicate 10% to 50% to considering using prescribed drugs in certain countries may be counterfeit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. For instance， in Nigeria fake medicines may be more than 60 -70% of the drugs in circulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， and 109 children died in 1990 after being administered fake Paracetamol 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In the Gambia the drug registration and control system resulted in the elimination of 'drug peddlers' and certain 'obsolete and harmful' drugs， as well as a significant decrease in the percentage of brand and combination drugs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>). The percentage of drugs failing quality control testing was found to be zero in Colombia， but 92% in the private sector of Chad 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Hence， it is challenging to obtain accurate data. The proportion of counterfeit drugs in the USA marketplace is believed to be small -less than 1% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> reported two cases of counterfeit medicines that found their way into legitimate medicine supply chain in the UK in 2004.\n\n【15】Poor quality drug preparations may lead to adverse clinical results both regarding low efficacy and in the development of drug resistance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Regulations are the primary devices em-ployed by most governments to protect the public health against substandard， counterfeit， low-quality medicines， and to con-trol prices. Thorough knowledge of whether these regulations produce the intended effects or generate unexpected adverse consequences is critical. The World Health Organisation (WHO) undertook some initiatives to improve medicines quality in its member states and promote global mechanisms for regulating the variety of pharmaceutical products in the international mar-kets. There are not any WHO guidelines on how to evaluate the impact of these regulations. There are numerous reports concerning drug regulations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>， but the published work on the effects of these regulations on the quality of medicines moving in the international commerce has been scarce. Findings from most published studies lack comparable quantitative informa-tion that would allow for objective judging whether and by how the implementation of the pharmaceutical regulations has made much progress on the various outcomes. To ignore evaluations and to implement drug regulation based on logic and theory is to expose society to new measures in the same way patients were exposed to untested medicines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【16】The present policy of the national health-care system in Su-dan is based on ensuring the welfare of the Sudanese inhabitants through increasing national production and upgrading the pro-ductivity of individuals. A health development strategy has been formulated in a way that realises the relevance of health ob-jectives to the primary goals of the national development plans. The strategy of Sudan at the national level aims at developing the Primary Health Care (PHC) services in the rural areas as well as urban areas. In Sudan， 2567 physicians provide the pub-lic health services (554 specialists， 107 medical registrars，1544medical officers， 156 dentists， and 206 pharmacists).\n\n【17】Methods of preventing and controlling health problems are the following：\n\n【18】· Promotion of food supply and proper nutrition；\n\n【19】·An adequate supply of safe water and basic sanitation；\n\n【20】· Maternal and child health-care；\n\n【21】· Immunisation against major infectious diseases；\n\n【22】· Preventing and control of locally endemic diseases； and\n\n【23】·Provision of essential drugs.\n\n【24】This will be achieved through a health system consisting of three levels (state， provincial and localities)， including the referral system， secondary and tertiary levels. Pharmacy management should be coordinated and integrated with other various aspects of health. The following are recommended：\n\n【25】· The community must be the focus of benefits accruing from restructures， the legislature should protect community in-terest by equity and distribution， handover the assets to the community should be examined， and communities shall encourage the transfer the management of health schemes to a professional entity.\n\n【26】The private sector should be used to mobilise and strengthen the technical and financial resources from within and outside the country to implement the services， with particular emphasis on utilisation of local resources.\n\n【27】拿TThe government should provide the necessary financial re-sources to guide the process of community management of pharmacy supplies. The government should be a facilitator through setting up standards， specifications and rules to help harmonise the private sector and establish a legally independent body by an act of parliament to monitor and control the providers. The government should assist the poor communities who cannot afford service cost and alle-viate social-economic negative aspects of privatisation.\n\n【28】The sector actors should create awareness in the community of the roles of the private sector and government in the provision of health and pharmacy services.\n\n【29】·SSupport agencies should assist with financial and technical support， training facilities， coordination， development and dissemination of health projects， as well as evaluation of projects.\n\n【30】Aims and Objectives\n\n【31】The primary purpose of this study is to analyse and determine the opinion of a group of pharmacists who are the owners or shareholders of the Sudanese medicine importing companies， and their perception concerning the effects of the government's new Pharmacy， Poisons， Cosmetics and Medical Devices Act has had on the quality of medicines in Sudan. To achieve this purpose， the following questions would be answered：\n\n【32】1\\. Do the Sudan pharmacy legislations prohibit the marketing of low-quality medicines?\n\n【33】2\\. What is the impact of the transfer of veterinary medicines registration system to the Ministry of Animal Resources after the approval of the Pharmacy and Poisons Act 2001?\n\n【34】3\\. Does a pre-marketing analysis of medicines help to detect the counterfeit medicines?\n\n【35】4\\. Does importation of non-registered medicines by the gov-ernment and non- governmental organisations exacerbate the problem of low-quality medicine if any?\n\n【36】In Sudan， the researchers did not identify any rigorous eval-uations or quantitative studies about the impact of drug regu-lations on the quality of medicines and how to protect public health against counterfeit or low-quality medicines， although it is practically possible. However， the regulations must be contin-ually evaluated to ensure the public health is protected against fake medicines by providing the exclusive marketing of high-quality medicines rather than commercial interests， and the drug companies are held accountable for their conducts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【37】Medicines Legislation Framework in Sudan\n\n【38】Safety， quality and efficacy control the availability of medicines in Sudan. Thus， the government effects control by the Pharmacy，\n\n【39】Poisons， Cosmetics and Medical Devices Act 2001 and its instru-ments. The Federal or State Departments of Pharmacy (DOP) and directives issued orders. The primary objective of both Fed-eral and States' Departments of Pharmacy is to safeguard public health by ensuring all medicines and pharmaceuticals on the Sudan market meet appropriate standards of safety， quality and efficacy. The safeguarding of public health is achieved largely through the system of medicines'registration and licensing of pharmacy premises.\n\n【40】The first Pharmacy and Poisons Act was enacted in 1939. This Act had been amended three times since then. In 2001amendments， cosmetics and medical devices were also brought under its purview. Thus， the name was changed to Pharmacy， Poisons， Cosmetics and Medical Devices Act (hereafter the Act). The Act regulates the compounding， sale， distribution， supply， dispensing of medicines and provides different levels of con-trol for different categories， e.g.， medicines， poisons， cosmetics， chemicals for medical use and medical devices.\n\n【41】The Act makes provision for the publication of regulations and guidelines by the Federal Pharmacy and Poisons Board(FPPB)， the pharmaceutical regulatory authority and its execu-tive arm -the Federal General Directorate of Pharmacy (FGDOP). The FGDOP regulates mainly four aspects of medicines use：safety， quality， efficacy and price. Traditionally， governments in many countries， primarily developed nations have attempted to ensure the efficiency， protection， rational prescribing， and dispensing of drugs through pre-marketing registration， licens-ing and other regulatory requirements 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. When applying to register the medicine manufacturers and importers are required to furnish the FGDOP with a dossier of information including among others， the indication of the medicine， its efficacy， side effects， contraindication， warnings on usage by high-risk groups， price， storage and disposal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The role of the FGDOP includes among others：\n\n【42】1\\. Regulation and control of the importation， exportation， manufacture， advertisement， distribution， sale and the use of medicines， cosmetics， medical devices and chemicals；\n\n【43】2\\. Approval and registration of new medicines -the Act re-quires FGDOP should register every medicine before being sold or marketed. Companies are required to submit appli-cations for the registration of medicines for the evaluation and approval；\n\n【44】3\\. Undertake appropriate investigations into the production premises and raw materials for drugs and establish rele-vant quality assurance systems including certification of the production sites and regulated products；\n\n【45】4\\. Undertake inspection of drugs’ whole and retail sellers owned by both the public or private sectors；\n\n【46】5\\. Compile standard specifications and regulations and guide-lines for the production， importation， exportation， sale and distribution of drugs， cosmetics，etc.\n\n【47】6\\. Control of quality of medicines： Regular inspection and post-marketing surveill ance will do this；\n\n【48】7\\. Licensing of pharmacy premises (i.e.， pharmaceutical plants， wholesalers and retail pharmacies)；\n\n【49】8\\. Maintain national drug analysis laboratories for the pre-and post-marketing analysis of medicines；\n\n【50】9\\. Coordination with states departments of pharmacy to en-sure the enforcement of the Act and its rules and directives.\n\n【51】Health and Pharmacy Systems\n\n【52】The health system in Sudan is characterised by heavy reliance on charging users at the point of access (private expenditure on health is 79%)， withless use of prepayment system such as health insurance. The way the health system is funded， organised， managed and regulated affects health workers’ supply retention， and the performance. Primary Health Care was adopted as a leading strategy for health-care provision in Sudan， and new strategies were introduced during the last decade， including：\n\n【53】·Health area system.\n\n【54】· Polio eradication in 1988.\n\n【55】· Integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) initia-tive.\n\n【56】·Rollback malaria strategy.\n\n【57】·Necessary developmental need approach in 1997.\n\n【58】·Safe motherhood， making pregnancy safer initiative， eradi-cation of harmful traditional practices and emergency ob-stetrics' care programmes.\n\n【59】The strategy of price liberalisation and privatisation had been implemented in Sudan over the last decades and had had a positive result on the deficit. The investment law 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> approved recently has good statements and rules on the above strategy in particular to health and pharmacy areas. The privatisation and price liberalisation in health fields have to re-structure (but not fully). Availability and adequate pharmacy supplies to the major sectors. The result is that the present situation of pharmacy services is far better than ten years ago.\n\n【60】The government of Sudan has a great experience in the pri-vatisation of the public institutions， i.e.， the Sudanese free zones and markets， Sudan telecommunications (Sudatel) and Sudan airlines. These experiences provide useful lessons about the efficiency and effectiveness of the privatisation policy. Through privatisation， the government is not evading its responsibility of providing health-care to the inhabitants but merely shifting its role from being a provider to a regulator and standard set-ter. Drug financing was privatised early in 1992. Currently， the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) has privatised specific non-medical services in hospitals such as catering services， security and cleanings.\n\n【61】The overall goal of the CMS ownership privatisation is to im-prove access to essential medicines and other medical supplies to improve the health status of the inhabitants particularly in far states (e.g.， Western and Southern States).\n\n【62】Establishment of alternative ownership for the CMS can be achieved by selling the majority of shares to the private sector. This will accomplish the following objectives：\n\n【63】·High access to essential medicines of good quality and af-fordable prices to the states' population and governments.\n\n【64】· Efficiency and effectiveness in drug distribution system to avoid the severe pitfalls and incidences that were reported during the last ten years in the CMS.\n\n【65】·Equity by reaching all remote areas currently derived from the formal drug distribution channels.\n\n【66】· Improvement of the quality and quantity of delivery of medicines to the public health facilities.\n\n【67】The above objectives are expected to：\n\n【68】· Increase geographical and economic access to essential medicines in all states (i.e.， in both rural and urban areas) to reach at least 80% of the population (currently， less than50% of population have access to essential medicines).\n\n【69】· The tax collection from the new business becomes more effi-cient and will increase after privatisation. The tax revenues could be used to finance other health-care activities.\n\n【70】· If the government reserves some shares (not more than 50%) in the new business， then its shares’ profit could be used to finance free medicines project in hospitals outpatients'clinic， and other exempted medicines， e.g. renal dialysis and haemophilic patients' treatment.\n\n【71】The privatisation of Public Pharmaceutical Supplies\n\n【72】The term privatisation has generally been defined as any pro-cess that aims to shift functions and responsibilities (entirely or partially) from the government to the private. More broadly meaning， it refers to the restriction of the government's role and putting forward some methods or policies to strengthen the free market economy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Privatisation can be an ideology (for those who oppose government and seek to reduce its size， role， and costs， or for those who wish to encourage diversity， decentrali-sation， and choice) or a tool of government (for those who see the private sector as more efficient， flexible， and innovative than the public sector) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. In 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> contends that “the invisible hand of the market is more efficient and responsive to the consumer needs and the public administrative budgets consume a large portion of tax monies that could otherwise be used for service delivery\". The emphasis is on improving the efficiency of all public enterprises， whether retained or divested. Privatisation may take many forms including：\n\n【73】·Elimination of a public function and its assignment to the private sector for financial support as well as delivery (po-lice， and fire departments， schools， etc.). Opponents charac-terise this as \"load-shedding\".\n\n【74】·Deregulation： the elimination of government responsible for setting standards and rules concerning goods or ser-vices.\n\n【75】· Assets sales： the selling of a public asset (city buildings，and sports stadiums) to private firms.\n\n【76】·VVouchers： are the government provided or financed cards or slips of paper that permit private individuals to purchase goods or services from a private provider (food stamps) or circumscribed list of providers.\n\n【77】·Franchising： the establishment of models by the public sector that is funded by government agencies， but imple-mented by approved private providers.\n\n【78】·Contracting： the government financing of services， choice of service provider， and the specification of various aspects of the services laid out in contracts with the private-sector organisation that produces or delivers the services.\n\n【79】·User fees： public facilities such as hospitals that maximise their income or finance some goods from private sources， either through drug sales or other services. This kind of privatisation has been applied in Sudan since the early1990s， as the health financing mechanism (especially for medicines).\n\n【80】In Sudan， the government has decided to distance itself from direct involvement in business， and thus divest most of its in-terests whether in loss or profit-making public enterprises. The public reform programme was set firmly in the context of the broader reforms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>， which were introduced in 1992. It had\n\n【81】become clear the previous policies had delivered led to poor re-sults. This reform based on the transfer of activities vested with the government institutions in the private sector. It signalled the government intends to reduce its presence in the economy， to reduce the level and scope of public spending and to allow market forces to govern economic activities. Privatisation also forms part of the government strategy of strengthening the role of the private in the development to achieve the vision of the25 years strategy in which the private sector will be the engine for economic growth. The privatisation started in 1992 by the liberalisation of the local currency， foreign exchange transac-tions， internal and external trade， prices and health services (e.g. user fee as a mechanism of drug financing and other services). This reform had led to greater reliance on individual initiative and corporate accountability rather than on government as a decision-maker in business matters.\n\n【82】The privatisation policy goal is to improve the performance of the public sector companies so that they can contribute to the growth and the development of the economy by broaden-ing ownership， participation in management， and stimulating domestic and foreign private investment.\n\n【83】The following are the primary objectives， which have been defined in the government's policy statement on public sector reform 19\\]：\n\n【84】· Improve the operational efficiency of enterprises that are currently in the public sector by exposing business and services to the most significant competition for the benefit of the consumer and the national economy.\n\n【85】· Reduce the burden of public enterprises on the govern-ment's budget by spreading the shares’ ownership as widely as possible among the population.\n\n【86】·正Expand the role of the private sector in the economy (permit-ting the government to concentrate on the public resources) on its role as a provider of essential public services，includ-ing health， education， social infrastructure， and to compact the side effects of the privatisation.\n\n【87】· Encourage wider participation of the people in the owner-ship and management of the business.\n\n【88】In pursuing the primary objectives， the privatisation policy aims to transform the performance of most significant enter-prises in the public sector and ensure liquidation of all viable and non-viable public enterprises as soon as possible through commercialisation，restructuring and divestiture.\n\n【89】Public sector reform efforts are thus aimed at reducing gov-ernment dominance and promoting a more significant role for the private sector while improving government's use of re-sources. The movement towards those goals in some countries is supported by components of a structural adjustment loan， which helped initiate the programme and establish the legislative and institutional base.\n\n【90】Opponents argue that the original objectives of state owner-ship were to ensure the corporate sector of the economy was in national hands rather than being controlled by either foreign investors or the minorities that enjoyed business dominance upon independence. A further objective was to use investment in state firms to accelerate development in a situation， in which private sector was reluctant to take risks.\n\n【91】Medicines Legislation Framework in Sudan\n\n【92】The availability of medicines in Sudan is controlled by safety， quality and efficacy. Thus， the government effects control by the Pharmacy， Poisons， Cosmetics and Medical Devices Act2001 and its instruments. The Federal or State Departments of Pharmacy (DOP) and directives issue orders. The primary ob-jective of both Federal and States’ Departments of Pharmacy is to safeguard public health by ensuring all medicines and phar-maceuticals on the Sudan market meet appropriate standards of safety， quality and efficacy. The safeguarding of public health is achieved largely through the system of medicines registration and licensing of pharmacy premises.\n\n【93】The first Pharmacy and Poisons Act was enacted in 1939and has been amended three times since. In the 2001 amend-ments， cosmetics and medical devices were also brought under its purview. Thus， the name was changed to Pharmacy， Poi-sons， Cosmetics and Medical Devices Act (hereafter the Act). The Act regulates the compounding， sale， distribution， supply， dispensing of medicines and provides different levels of con-trol for different categories， e.g.， medicines， poisons， cosmetics， chemicals for medical use and medical devices.\n\n【94】The Act makes provision for the publication of regulations and guidelines by the Federal Pharmacy and Poisons Board(FPPB)， the pharmaceutical regulatory authority and its execu-tive arm - the Federal General Directorate of Pharmacy (FGDOP). The FGDOP regulates mainly four aspects of medicines use：safety， quality， efficacy and price. Traditionally， governments in many countries， primarily developed nations have attempted to ensure the efficiency， safety， rational prescribing， and dispens-ing of drugs through pre-marketing registration， licensing and other regulatory requirements. When applying to register the medicine manufacturers and importers are required to furnish the FGDOP with a dossier of information including the indica-tion of the medicine， its efficacy， side effects， contraindication， warnings on usage by high-risk groups， price， storage and dis-posal\n\n【95】Sudan Medicines'Quality Measures\n\n【96】The following summarises the quality measures of all medicines.\n\n【97】Registration of Medicines\n\n【98】The FGDOP is responsible for the appraisal， and registration of all medicines and other pharmaceuticals for both human and veterinary use on the Sudan market. It is also responsible for the verification of the competence of manufacturing companies， the manufacturing plants， the ability to produce substances or products of high quality before registering these companies and allowing them to apply for registration of their products in Su-dan. When necessary， visits conducted to those companies and their manufacturing units， to verify their compliance with good manufacturing practice recommended by the WHO. The appli-cant for registration of pharmaceutical product must submit all prescribed data and the certificates required under the WHO certification scheme for a pharmaceutical product is moving into international commerce， and any other information that is necessary for assuring the quality， efficiency and stability of the product through its shelf life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【99】Licensing of Pharmacy Premises\n\n【100】The licensing is a registration exercise to provide the DOP at the state level (Federal level in case of local manufacturing plants) with the information necessary for the full implementation of the Act. Licenses are granted for a period of one year and may\n\n【101】be renewed at the end of December every year (applications to the relevant DOP before the expiry of the current license). To improve the effectiveness of the public pharmacy，resources should be switched towards areas of need， reducing inequalities and promoting better health conditions. Medicines are financed either through cost sharing or fully private. The role of the private services is significant. The present policy of the national health-care system in Sudan is based on ensuring the welfare of the Sudanese inhabitants through increasing national production and upgrading the productivity of individuals. The strategy of price liberalisation and privatisation had been implemented in Sudan over the last decade and had had a positive result on the deficit. There are three significant licenses as follows：\n\n【102】a) License A (Wholesaler License)\n\n【103】The pharmaceutical importing companies have subjected to two broad categories of regulation. Those are the registration and administrative process， and the regulation of quality manufac-turing standards， efficacy and information disclosure.\n\n【104】License A authorises the holder to sell a registered medicine to a person who buys the medicine for sale or supply to someone else under the direct supervision of a registered pharmacist or licensed medical doctor. Licensing of the wholesalers involves identification of the wholesaler and suitability of the premise. There are 175 wholesalers in Sudan. The majority (162 whole-salers) are local agents for the goods manufactured from abroad. The rest are 13 “local manufacturer”wholesalers at Khartoum State (KS) and distribute the medicines to the whole country. The state DOP inspects wholesalers before a license is granted and after that at least once per year\n\n【105】b) License B (Retail Pharmacy License)\n\n【106】Authorises the holder to sell a registered medicine to a patient on a prescription or over-the-counter basis under the direct supervi-sion of the registered pharmacist. The pharmacies are inspected before a license is issued and after that at least twice per year.\n\n【107】c) License D (Manufacturer's License)\n\n【108】Manufacturing includes many processes carried out in the course of making a medicinal product. A manufacturer’s li-cense covers all aspects-bulk drug， product manufacture， filling， labelling and packaging- under the supervision of a registered pharmacist. There are 13 generic manufacturing sites at Khar-toum State (KS). The Federal DOP inspects each one. Good manufacturing practice (GMP) is the basis of the inspection. Ef-fective control of quality requires a manufacturer possess， and the appropriate facilities concerning premises， equipment， staff， expertise and useful well-equipped quality control laboratory. Frequently，before a license is granted， inspection of premises is made， and Federal DOP takes this into account. The local manu-facturers produce 65 pharmaceutical dosage forms of essential drugs and cover 60% of the Central Medical Supplies Public Organisation (CMSPO) purchases. In Sudan there are two types of retail pharmacy：\n\n【109】Commercial Private Pharmacies\n\n【110】These are private establishments retailing registered drugs and medical supplies at a markup of 18%. The source of the drugs and pharmaceuticals is private wholesalers. In 2002， though unlawful， the CMSPO sPStarted to sell its non-registered medicin es to the private pharmacies. By the end of 2004， there were 779private pharmacies in Sudan.\n\n【111】These are quasi-public establishments retailing drugs and med-ical supplies below the market prices to improve access and availability of pharmaceuticals. They were founded in the early1980s as a pilot study for a drug cost recovery system. Those differ from the private commercial pharmacies. Firstly， in hav-ing access to the CMSPO drugs， i.e.， generic and large pack products， also the brand products from the private wholesalers. Secondly， the peoples' pharmacies are only owned by public organisations (e.g.， hospitals， peoples' committees， trade unions and Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs)). The markup on cost for drugs from the CMSPO (35%)， and from private drug wholesalers (profit margin is 10%). However， they have become commercialised now and operate in a similar way to private pharmacies. The total number of such pharmacies was approximately 200 in Sudan.\n\n【112】Public Sector Medicines Supply System\n\n【113】In Sub-Saharan Africa countries， discussions about medicine distribution system reform have concentrated on ways to im-prove sustainability and quality of access to essential medicines. These discussions also include debate on the impact of privatisa-tion of public drug supply organisations on effectiveness， effi-ciency， quality and cost of medicines in the public health facili-ties， as well as on the respective role of the public and private sectors.\n\n【114】Until the mid-1980s， some governments in Africa (i.e.， Mali and Guinea) assumed responsibility for providing drugs to their citizens. The private distribution of all drugs including aspirin was illegal. In many countries， including Sudan there were two parallel government distribution systems. The public health network of hospitals and health centres gratuitously distributed drugs. In the public sector pharmacies， the drugs were sold to the public at subsidised prices.\n\n【115】LDuring the 1990s， Sudan initiated some initiatives to establish drug-financing mechanisms as part of the health reform process and decentralised decision-making at a state level. In 1992 when a law was passed， medicines were no longer free of charge (i.e.， privatised) in the public health system. The government aims to increase equitable access to essential medicines， especially at the states'level. As a result of the Central Medical Stores， which was responsible for medicines supply system of the public health facilities， became an autonomous drug supply agency and was renamed as the Central Medical Supplies Public Corporation(CMS) and operated on a cash-and-carry basis. It was capitalised， and an executive board was installed. Since states and federal hospitals have to buy their medicines and other medical supplies. They organised their transport means and distribution to their primary health-care facilities and hospitals. Also， all hospitals became financially autonomous entities and had had to organise their medicines procurement system.\n\n【116】The public drug supply system has not been working well throughout Sub-Saharan Africa， and this includes Sudan. There are severe shortages or no medicines at all， particularly in rural areas. A study in Cameroon found the rural health centres re-ceived only 65% of the stock designated for them， and 30% of the medicines that arrived at the centres did not reach the clients. The loss rate after arrival in hospitals was estimated at 40%.In Sudan， Graff and Evarard 通用删除7(英):<u>(2003)</u> who visited the country on a WHO mission reported，“Although the cash-and-carry system took off well， lack of sufficient foreign exchange hampered the\n\n【117】CMS procurement activities and resulted in low stock levels of all medicines and even stock out of life-saving products. Hos-pitals had to purchase the medicines from elsewhere and often had to buy from the private sector. Overall hospitals' budgets were tied to allocate drug budget， and sales income was not sufficient to cover the purchase of needed medicines supplies. This resulted in the medicines were not available most of the times. The in- or outpatients with their prescriptions were di-rected to the private pharmacies. In 2003， Khartoum Teaching Hospital-the biggest hospital in Sudan (not further than 5 km away from the CMS) had a medicine stock of only LS 83，000(US$ 31). This would not fill one prescription for an anaemic patient as a result of renal failure. This is a common practice that patients or their relatives are given prescriptions to buy any pharmaceutical supplies that are needed including drugs and other disposables from private sector pharmacies.\n\n【118】Many ministries of health，services' providers and researchers have identified many characteristics that lead to poor perfor-mance in Africa public drug supply systems. These characteris-tics include：\n\n【119】1\\. The absence of competition： Competition is the best way to ensure the goods and services desired by the consumer are provided at the lowest economic cost. Given the customers(i.e.， public health facilities) freedom of choice enables mar-ket forces to provide sustained pressures on companies to increase efficiency. Privatised companies generally operate in a competitive market environment.\n\n【120】2\\. Insufficient funding： For example in Sudan except for Khar-toum， Gezira and Gedaref states， all other states do not have enough funds to establish an efficient drug supply system. In spite of being a profit-making organisation， the CMS failed to avail such funds during the past 14 years.\n\n【121】3\\. Inefficient use of available resources： Since CMS was es-tablished in the early 1990s working as a profit-making organisation. Due to the absence of privatisation， the CMS engaged in an instalment of repackaging joint venture phar-maceutical factory in 1999 and recently announced its com-mitment to building a pharmaceutical city with not less than US$ 20 million， despite the lack of life-saving medicines in the public health facilities. Such an amount could be suffi-cient to establish a reliable supply system for all states of Sudan. The lack of prioritisation is a typical symptom and sign of most public organisations.\n\n【122】4\\. Poor management：\n\n【123】There are some constraints inherent in operating govern-ment drug supply service.\n\n【124】These constraints comprise：\n\n【125】·Civil servants are hired， rather than persons with busi-ness experience and skills. Managers confront differ-ent challenges in a public setting. They are not easily hired or fired. The lack of accountability results from the lack of shareholders， who would be free to remove incompetent administrators.\n\n【126】· Even if the services can recruit outside of civil service， the wages are often too low to attract experienced man-agers. Also， the managers do not share in dividends， or other monetary activities as do private managers and incentives for doing well are often attenuated in a bureaucracy.\n\n【127】· There are cultural and structural conditions that pro-mote corruptions including the enormous pressure of wages earners to support an extended family and a strong incentive to more than their fixed government wage， traditional gift-giving practice and a proprietary view of public offices.\n\n【128】The privatisation of the CMS's Ownership\n\n【129】The public sector drug supply institutions have not succeeded(CMS is not exceptional) so far in organising a reliable and regu-lar essential drug supply for the public health facilities (Huss，1996). One of the most criticisms of the public drug supply sys-tem generally in Africa and particularly in Sudan is how poorly they are internally managed. There are those who agree the more significant amount of real pharmaceutical resources could be made available to the public health-care system and the ac-cess to essential medicines could be significantly increased，if the managerial efficiency of the system improved (Akin，1987). Given the limitation of the public sector - due to constraints in-herent in operating a government drug supply organisation even after autonomous experience-and the stabilised role of the pri-vate sector organisations such as private pharmaceutical sectors organisations (rapid increase in importing companies， manu-facturers and pharmacies). Telecommunications， e.g.， Sudatel is one of the apparent solutions of choice for the government pharmaceutical policy would be to privatise the ownership of the CMS to the extent possible.\n\n【130】Advantages of Private Agencies\n\n【131】There are many arguments in favour of privatisation of public institutions. Advocates of this method claim privatisation have the following advantages：\n\n【132】· Privatisation is efficient and effective because it fosters and initiates competition. The competition among firms drives the cost down. Empirical studies prove the cost of the services provided by the government is much higher than Dy when private contractors provide the services. For example， CMS's declared markup on cost (35%) amounted to 2.3times the private markup (15%). Also， the private sector pays taxes， customs and other governmental fees (CMS exempted).\n\n【133】· Privatisation also provides better management than the public management. Because decision making under pri-vatisation is directly related to the costs and benefits. In other words， the privatisation fosters proper management because the cost of the service is usually obscured.\n\n【134】·Privatisation would help to limit the size of government at least regarding the number of employees. On the other hand， it is a fact that overstaffing is common in publicly owned enterprises.\n\n【135】· Privatisation can help to reduce dependence on a govern-ment monopoly， which causes inefficiencies and ineffective-ness in seryices.\n\n【136】·The private sector is more flexible regarding responding to the needs of citizens. Greater flexibility in the use of personnel and equipment would be achieved for short-term projects， part-time work， etc. Bureaucratic formalities are very common when the government delivers the service. Less tolerance and strict hierarchy in the bureaucracy are the reasons of the inflexibility in publicly provided services.\n\n【137】Medicines Supply System\n\n【138】The Act， for the first time in Sudan， has given the responsibility of veterinary medicines to separate committees. The Ministry of Animal Resources took the law “in hand\"， and started the registration of veterinary medicines and the licensing of the veterinary medicines premises. The conflict in the shared au-thorities between the Ministry of Health and the chairman of the FPPB lead to the freezing of the Board since October 2002. The FGDOP continues in the process of medicines registration， inspection of the pharmaceutical premises and the licensing as before establishment of the FPPB.\n\n【139】The Act also obliges the states' governments to take all steps necessary to ensure compliance with the marketing of registered medicines in licensed premises. However， the weaknesses of the regulatory infrastructure and lack of political commitment at state levels， the leakage of low quality， unregistered medicines to those states are highly suspected. This left the door widely opened for the informal marketing of medicines particularly in far states. The states regulatory authorities should take advan-tage of the legal authority granted by the Sudan constitution and the Pharmacy， Poisons， Cosmetics and the Medical Devices Act 2001 to enforce the regulations and increase the frequency of the inspection visits to drug companies and retail pharmacies.\n\n【140】Experience has shown the poor regulation of medicines can lead to the prevalence of substandard， counterfeit， harmful and ineffective medicines on the national markets and the inter-national commerce. The Sudanese pharmaceutical， the legal framework was described as one of the strictest pharmaceutical systems in the region. One of the great loopholes in this sys-tem was found to be the increased number of non-registered medicines-governmental sources such as the Central Medical Supplies Public Organisation (CMSPO) and not-for-profit， Non-governmental Organisations (NGOs). Respondents were hope-ful the double standard of rules enforcement would be lifted after the new national unity government take over， arguing the current situation in which public organisations (such as the CM-SPO) sell non-registered medicines to the private pharmacies could enhance trading of counterfeit medicines and create the unfair competitive environment.\n\n【141】One of the respondent reported， “It is disturbing， in spite of the existence of appropriate legislation， illegal distribution of medicines by the CMSPO. The CMSPO continues to flourish， giving the impression the government is insensitive to a harmful effect on the people of medicines distribution unlawfully， and some are of doubtful quality\". During the past three years， the CMSPO started to sell unregistered medicines to the private pharmacies. The CMSPO practice (he added) will undermine the inspection and medicines control activities and ultimately jeopardise the health of the people taking medication.\n\n【142】Not surprisingly all respondents strongly agreed the in-creased number of sources of non-registered medicines would lead to the entrance of low-quality medicines. This result is inline with the WHO recommendation， which encourages the regulatory authorities and state members' government to regis ter all medicines before the marketing. The medicines imported by public sector organisations are not excluded.\n\n【143】The FGDOP should define the norms， standards and speci-fications necessary for ensuring the safety， efficacy and quality of medicinal products. The availability， accuracy and clarity of drug information can affect the drug use decisions. The FG-DOP does not have a well-developed system for pre-approval of medicines labels， promotional， and advertising materials. The\n\n【144】terms and conditions under， which licenses to import， manu-facture and distribute will be suspended，revoked or cancelled. This should be stringently applied to public， private and not-for-profit NGOs drug supplies organisations.\n\n【145】The predominant view， shared between the medicines' im-porters is the current pharmacy legislation to some extent satis-factory and managed to prohibit the marketing of low-quality medicines. The recent post-marketing study carried by the Na-tional Drug Quality Control Laboratories suggested the power of the current regulation is overestimated. The finding of this com-munication indicates the application procedures for the current measures to ensure the quality of medicines should be revisited. The technical complexity of regulations， political， commercial and social implications， makes necessary a degree of mutual trust between concerned stakeholders (i.e.， suppliers， doctors， pharmacists， consumer representatives and government agen-cies).\n\n【146】Rationale for the Research\n\n【147】The drug distribution network in Sudan during the past few years was in a state of confusion. It consists of open market， drug vendors (known as home drug store)， community (private) pharmacies， peoples’ pharmacies， private and public hospitals， doctors' private clinics， NGOs clinics， private medicines im-porters (wholesalers)，public wholesalers (i.e.， Central Medical Supplies and Khartoum State Revolving Drug Fund) and local pharmaceutical manufacturers. It is a common phenomenon in far states (e.g.， Western and Southern states) to see street sell-ers or mobile sellers (hawkers) sell cigarettes， perfumes， orange and astonishingly medicines that range from Paracetamol and Aspirin tablets to antibiotics and anti-malarial drugs including injections. The medicines are usually left under the sun， and such conditions could facilitate the deterioration of the active ingredients.\n\n【148】The states' departments of pharmacy statutorily licensed com-munity and Peoples' pharmacies. A superintending pharmacist， who is permanently registered with the Sudan Medical Council and licensed， oversees the pharmacy any time it is opened for business 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. With such pharmacies， there should not be any serious of the sale of fake drugs. Unfortunately， however， many pharmacies are working without qualified pharmacists.\n\n【149】This study is significant because the people right to health includes the right access to a reliable standard of health care， and assurance the medicines received are not only genuine but also safe， effective， of good quality and affordable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. The Sudan government has designed various ways to protect the public against low-quality medicines. It is expected to equip the departments of pharmacy especially in remote areas， poor states with material and trained staff to effectively perform duties.\n\n【150】A recent unpublished post-marketing surveillance revealed that 35% of the CMSPO samples and 16% of the private com-panies (registered products) samples obtained from different pharmacy shops failed to pass the quality test 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. However， very few studies if any have been undertaken to evaluate the impact of the regulations put in place by the government a long time ago.\n\n【151】This study should reveal the strength and weaknesses of the legal pharmaceutical framework in Sudan from drug importers perspective. The findings of this investigation would be instruc-tive to regulatory authorities in the developing countries. It also highlights how systematically the drug companies perceived\n\n【152】the role of pharmacy regulations in assuring high quality of medicines and what suggestions (if any) they had to make to improve the regulatory framework.\n\n【153】Methodology\n\n【154】The study proposal was discussed to identify and improve the quality of medicines in Sudan. The survey was deliberately drug importers biased， as low-quality medicines from informal sources will affect their business 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. The authors then designed a self-administered questionnaire of 14 close-ended questions and one open question. The questionnaire was designed to address the main six issues：\n\n【155】·The quality of medicines.\n\n【156】· The consequences of the splitting of the regulatory authority functions between the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) and the Ministry of Animal Resources (MOAR).\n\n【157】Views on the role of the recently established Federal Phar-macy and Poisons Board， and Pre- and Post-Marketing Suryeillance.\n\n【158】Decentralisation， and\n\n【159】· Increased number of suppliers of non-registered medicines.\n\n【160】The final version of the questionnaire had been tested (three pharmacists working with drug companies in Sudan were asked to fill out the questionnaire and feed the authors back whether there was an unclear question or not). The questionnaire was tested to make sure all relevant issues were covered，pre-coded and adjusted before its distribution (Appendix 1).\n\n【161】The questionnaire was distributed to all forty participants at a seminar held in July 2004. Total numbers of drug importers companies were 175 in 2004. The seminar was organised by the FGDOP on the new proposal to limit (agree on a ceiling for each item) the number of a commercial brand product registered from each generic drug (the current situation is open). The owners and shareholders of drug companies were the participants. This was seen by the authors as a great opportunity to collect data on the drug importers' perspective on the quality of medicines. Hence， the study participants were so busy， and it was very difficult to devote a time to be interviewed by the authors. Also， the postal services in Sudan are poor (too slow and unreliable).\n\n【162】Before the beginning of the seminar， the participants were requested by the Secretariat to complete the questionnaire and hand it back to the secretariat before departure. The participants were informed it is an anonymous questionnaire. The reasons given to the participants for filling out the questionnaire was to enable academic research to assess the impact of the new Act on the quality of medicines. Finally， at the end of the seminar， the secretariat managed to get 30 questionnaires， representing 75%out of 40 distributed.\n\n【163】The information necessary to conduct this evaluation was col-lected from 30 pharmacists working with medicines' importing companies. Data gathered by the questionnaire were electroni-cally analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 12.0 for windows.\n\n【164】Result and Discussion\n\n【165】The drug distribution network in Sudan consists of open market， drug vendors (known as home drug store)， community (private) pharmacies， people's pharmacies， private and public hospitals， doctors' private clinics， NGOs clinics， private medicines im-porters (wholesalers)， public wholesalers (i.e.， Central Medical\n\n【166】Supplies and Khartoum State Revolving Drug Fund) and local pharmaceutical manufacturers.

With such phar-macies， there should not be any serious of the sale of fake drugs. Unfortunately， however， many pharmacies are working without qualified pharmacists 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>.\n\n【167】Table 1 Pharmacists labour market 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>\n\n| Institutions  | 1989  | 2003  | Increase in (%)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Faculties of Pharmacy  | 1  | 7  | 600%  |\n| Registered Pharmacists  | 1505  | 2992  | 99%  |\n| Public Sector Pharmacists  | 162  | 300  | 85%  |\n| Hospital Pharmacies  | 205  | 304  | 48%  |\n| Community Pharmacies  | 551  | 779  | 41%  |\n| Drug Importing Companies  | 77  | 175  | 127%  |\n| Drug Manufacturers  | 5  | 14  | 180%  |\n\n【169】During the last decade， the pharmacy workforces have wit-nessed a significant increase in the number of pharmacies， drug importing companies and pharmaceutical manufacturers as shown in Table 1. In the public sector， adoption of cost-sharing policy as a mechanism of financing for essential medicines at full price cost requires far more expertise than simply distributing free medicines. This policy increases the demand for pharma-cists in hospitals. The new concept of pharmaceutical care and recognition pharmacists as health care team members will boost the demand for the skilled pharmacist registered (PHRs). The Federal Ministry of Health (MOH) faces two major issues with the PHRs： first， the current shortage of pharmacists in the public sector； secondly， the future role of pharmacists within the health cares system.\n\n【170】Around 3000 pharmacists are registered in Sudan. Only 300(10%) works with the public sector. 25，25，20 pharmacists were employed in Khartoum， KhartoumNorth and Omdurmanhospi-tals respectively. Some states (e.g.， Southern states has only two pharmacists) were not included in Table 2. This anomaly seems to imply the number of pharmacists in the public sector (has not only been insufficient in absolute terms but also has been inefficient in its distribution). This number will be depleted，and the situation may be getting worse. One reason is a migration to the private sector. The results are described in Figure 1.\n\n【171】In the absence of past baselines data， decisive conclusions should not be drawn from this article regarding the impact of the pharmaceutical regulations on ensuring good quality medicines. Nevertheless， the survey did serve to confirm the general impres-sion about medicines of good quality on the Sudanese market.\n\n【172】89% of respondents considered the medicines on the Su-danese market are generally of good quality. Although 55%of the study population either strongly agree (21%) or agree(34%) with the statement the drug legislation in Sudan prohibit the marketing of low-quality medicines. 35% believe the transfer of authority to recently established the Federal Pharmacy and Poisons Board (FPPB) will undermine on medicines quality as-\n\n【173】surance system. 38% of the participants thought the replacement of the FGDOP by the FPPB would improve the medicines quality control system.\n\n【174】Only one-fourth of respondents were not very confident in current systems and safeguarded to ensure the quality of medicines. 69% of respondents were somewhat confident in the FGDOP regulates and monitors the quality of medicines. The majority 79% of respondents agree with the statement \"decentral-isation of licensing and inspection of pharmaceutical premises will improve the pharmaceutical control\".\n\n【175】After the approval of the Pharmacy and Poisons Act 2001， the Ministry of Animal Resources (dominated by veterinarians) took the responsibility of registration of veterinary medicines and the licensing of the whole and retail sellers of veterinary medicines. As expected， 91% of respondents thought， the splitting of drug registration between the MOH and the MOAR weakens the medicines control， compared with only 9% who thought the arrangement would improve the quality of medicines. One of the respondents added： “The splitting of the drug authority between MOH， which according to the Sudan constitution is fully responsible for the public health and MOAR will create a contradiction in lines of commands， and public health would be compromised\". 84% of respondents agreed with the state-ment“This new arrangement could cause conflict between two regulatory authorities.\"\n\n【176】93% of participants either strongly agree (73%) or agree (20%) the increased number of non-registered medicines distributors will facilitate the marketing of low-quality medicines (Figure1). When asked about updated requirements of medicines registration， only 25% of respondents thought the updated re-quirements are not sufficient to prevent the marketing of low-quality medicines. Nearly three-quarters (71%) agreed the pre-marketing surveillance is not enough to ensure the quality of medicines. The law regulating medicines was judged by the respondents as generally adequate (68%).\n\n【177】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1： The increased numbers of non-registered medicines importers will facilitate the marketing of low-quality medicines.</u>\n\n【178】Medicines Supply System\n\n【179】The Act， for the first time in Sudan， has given the responsibility of veterinary medicines to separate committees. The Ministry of Animal Resources took the law “in hand\"， and started the registration of veterinary medicines and the licensing of the veterinary medicines premises. The conflict in the shared au-thorities between the Ministry of Health and the chairman of the FPPB lead to the freezing of the Board since October 2002. The FGDOP continues in the process of medicines registration， inspection of the pharmaceutical premises and the licensing as before establishment of the FPPB.\n\n【180】The Act also obliges the states' governments to take all steps necessary to ensure compliance with the marketing of registered\n\n【181】Table 2 Pharmacists' distribution at state levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>\n\n| State  | Number of pharmacists  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Department of Pharmacy (DOP) Khartoum State \\  | 8  |\n| DOP-North Darfur  | 7  |\n| DOP-Sennar  | 2  |\n| DOP-North Kordofan  | 5  |\n| DOP-South Kordofan  | 7  |\n| DOP-White Nile  | 2  |\n| DOP-Kassala  | 7  |\n| DOP-River Nile  | 3  |\n| DOP-Northern State  | 3  |\n| DOP-Al Gezira\\  | 6  |\n| Total\\\\  | 50  |\n| \\ The Pharmacists who work with Revolving Drug Funds are not included.  |  |\n| \\\\ Information about other.  |  |\n| States is not available (10 Southern states， 2 Darfur states， 2 Eastern states， 1 Blue Nile state， and 1 West Kordofan state).  |  |\n\n【183】medicines in licensed premises. However， the weaknesses of the regulatory infrastructure and lack of political commitment at state levels， the leakage of low quality， unregistered medicines to those states are highly suspected. This left the door widely opened for the informal marketing of medicines particularly in far states. The states regulatory authorities should take advan-tage of the legal authority granted by the Sudan constitution and the Pharmacy， Poisons， Cosmetics and the Medical Devices Act 2001 to enforce the regulations and increase the frequency of the inspection visits to drug companies and retail pharmacies.\n\n【184】Experience has shown the poor regulation of medicines can lead to the prevalence of substandard，counterfeit， harmful and ineffective medicines on the national markets and the interna-tional commerce. The Sudanese pharmaceutical， the legal frame-work was described as one of the strictest pharmaceutical sys-tems in the region. One of the great loopholes in this system was found to be the increased number of non-registered medicines-governmental sources such as the Central Medical Supplies Pub-lic Organisation (CMSPO) and not-for-profit， Non-governmental Organisations (NGOs). Respondents were hopeful the double standard of rules enforcement would be lifted after the new na-tional unity government take over， arguing the current situation in which public organisations (such as the CMSPO) sell non-registered medicines to the private pharmacies could enhance trading of counterfeit medicines and create unfair competitive environment.\n\n【185】One of the respondent reported，“It is disturbing， in spite of the existence of appropriate legislation， illegal distribution of medicines by the CMSPO. The CMSPO continues to flourish， giving the impression the government is insensitive to a harmful effect on the people of medicines distribution unlawfully， and some are of doubtful quality\". During the past three years， the CMSPO started to sell unregistered medicines to the private pharmacies. The CMSPO practice (he added) will undermine the inspection and medicines control activities and ultimately jeopardise the health of the people taking medication.\n\n【186】Not surprisingly all respondents strongly agreed the in-creased number of sources of non-registered medicines will lead to entrance of low quality medicines. This result is inline with the WHO recommendation， which encourages the regula-tory authorities and state members' government to register all medicines before the marketing. The medicines imported by public sector organisations are not excluded 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.\n\n【187】The FGDOP should define the norms， standards and speci-fications necessary for ensuring the safety， efficacy and quality of medicinal products. The availability， accuracy and clarity of drug information can affect the drug use decisions. The FG-DOP does not have a well-developed system for pre-approval of medicines labels， promotional， and advertising materials. The terms and conditions under， which licenses to import， manu-facture and distribute will be suspended，revoked or cancelled. This should be stringently applied to public， private and not-for-profit NGOs drug supplies organisations.\n\n【188】The predominant view， shared between the medicines' im-porters is the current pharmacy legislation to some extent satis-factory and managed to prohibit the marketing of low-quality medicines. The recent post-marketing study carried by the Na-tional Drug Quality Control Laboratories suggested the power of the current regulation is overestimated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. The finding of this approach indicates the application procedures for the current measures to ensure the quality of medicines should be revisited. The technical complexity of regulations， political， commercial and social implications， makes necessary a degree of mutual trust between concerned stakeholders (i.e.， suppliers， doctors， pharmacists， consumer representatives and government agen-cies).\n\n【189】Worldwide there are different systems for providing phar-macy services. Most countries have some element of state assis-tance， either for all patients or selected groups such as children PS and some private provisions. Medicines are financed either through cost sharing or fully private. The role of the private services is therefore much more significant. Nationally， there is\n\n【190】a mismatch between the numbers of pharmacists and where are they worked and the demand for pharmacy services. The po-sition is exacerbated locally where in some areas of poor； there is a real need for pharmacy services， which is not being met and where pharmacists have the little spare capacity. Various changes within the health-care system require serious attention be given to the pharmacy human resources need. To stem the brain drain of pharmacists， it is， however， necessary to have accurate information regarding the reasons that make the phar-macists emigrate to the private sector. Such knowledge is essen-e P tial in the making of informed decisions regarding the retention of qualified， skilled pharmacists in the public sector for a long time. There are currently 3000 pharmacists registered with the Sudan Medical Council of whom only 10% are working with the government. The pharmacist： population ratio indicates there is one pharmacist for every 11，433 inhabitants in Sudan， compared to the World Health Organisation (WHO) average for industrialised countries of one pharmacist for 2，300 inhabitants. The situation is particularly problematic in the Southern states where there is no pharmacist at all. The distribution of pharma-cists indicates the majority are concentrated in Khartoum state. When population figures are taken into consideration， all states except Khartoum and Gezira states are underserved compared to the WHO average. This mal-distribution requires serious action as the majority of the population is served in the public sector. This study reveals the low incentives， poor working con-ditions， job dissatisfaction and lack of professional development programmes as the primary reasons for the immigration to the private sector. The objective of this article is to highlight and provide an overview of the reasons that lead to the immigration of the public sector pharmacists to the private sector in Sudan. The survey was carried out in September 2004. Data gathered by the questionnaires were analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 12.0 for windows.\n\n【191】The result has been evaluated and tabulated in this article. The data presented in this paper can be considered as nucleus information for executing research and development for phar-macists and pharmacy. More measures must be introduced to attract pharmacists into the public sector. The emerging crisis in pharmacy human resources requires significant additional effort to gather knowledge and dependable data that can inform rea-sonable， practical， and coordinated responses from government， industry， and professional associations.\n\n【192】Discussions\n\n【193】In Sudan， with more than ten million people don’t have ade-quate access to health care； twenty million inhabitants are with-out access to pharmacy and a deficient proportion of people being treated in hospitals. The investment， which is needed to fund the extension and improvement of these services， is sub-stantial. Most governments in developing countries are ready to admit that they lack the financial resources for proper health and pharmacy schemes. Moreover， historically， bilateral and multi-lateral funding accounts for less than 10% of the total investment needed. Thus the need for private financing is imperative.\n\n【194】Many healthy utilities in developing countries need to work in earnest to improve the efficiency of operations. These im-provements will not only lead to better services but also to en-hanced net cash flows that can be re-invested to improve the quality of service. Staff productivity is another area where sig-nificant gains can be achieved. Failure of subsidies to reach\n\n【195】intended objectives is due， in part， to lack of transparency in their allocation. Allowances are often indiscriminately assigned to support investment programmes that benefit more middle and high-income families， which are already receiving accept-able service. Consumption subsidies often benefit upper-income domestic consumers' substantially more than low-income ones. Many developing countries (Sudan is not an exception) are en-couraging the participation of the private sector as a means to improve productivity in the provision of health and pharmacies services. Private-sector involvement is also needed to increase financial flows to expand the coverage and quality of services. Many successful private-sector interventions have been under-taken. Private operators are not responsible for the financing of works. Nonetheless， they can bring significant productivity gains， which would allow the utility to allocate more resources to improve and extend services. Redressing productivity， sub-sidy and cross-subsidy issues before the private sector is invited to participate has proven to be less contentious.\n\n【196】Despite the constraints， over the last decade， the rate of im-plementation of rural and peri-urban pharmacy supplies and healthy programmes has increased considerably， and many peo-ple are now being served more adequately. The following are\n\n【197】Sudan experience in pharmacy supply and healthy projects：At community level：\n\n【198】· Participatory approaches in planning， implementation and monitoring.\n\n【199】·Establishment and training of reliable financial and mainte-nance management.\n\n【200】· The sensitive timing of health and hygiene education.\n\n【201】At the state and nationallevel：\n\n【202】· Integrated multi-sectoral approach development.\n\n【203】· Training approach and material development for state and extension staff.\n\n【204】·CContinuing support from integrated multi-sectoral exten-sion team.\n\n【205】· Establishment of technical support system.\n\n【206】·A multi-sectoral advisory group including training and research institutions.\n\n【207】· Development and dissemination of relevant information for state and extension staff.\n\n【208】Table 3 Reasons for choosing public sector (N=26)\n\n| Reasons  | Percent  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Tob satisfaction  | 80.8  |\n| Sense of ownership  | 65.4  |\n| Training programme  | 46.2  |\n| The feeling of doing a public job  | 38.5  |\n| Pensions and other benefits  | 7.7  |\n\n【210】The respondents recommended continuing pharmacy pro-fessionals' development to assure the role of the pharmacists in the healthcare， creation of new jobs， increase the salaries of public sector pharmacists and activation of federal pharmacy and poisons board.\n\n【211】Table 4 Why do you intend to leave the public sector?'(N=16)\n\n| Reasons  | Percent  |\n| --- | --- |\n| High wages and incentives in the private sector  | 87.5  |\n| The private sector offers vehicles  | 56.3  |\n| The private give full treatment when feeling ill  | 50.0  |\n| Job satisfaction in the private  | 6.3  |\n\n【213】Table 5 Reasons discourage you from continuing with the public sector (N=26)\n\n| Reasons  | Percent  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Monetary issues  | 69.2  |\n| Lack of recognition of what I have done  | 57.7  |\n| Dim vision  | 53.8  |\n| Sense of instability  | 53.8  |\n| Those who work and those who don't are equal  | 53.8  |\n| Policy-makers don't care about pharmacy  | 53.8  |\n| Lack of job satisfaction  | 34.6  |\n| Political issues  | 15.4  |\n\n【215】Public Sector Pharmacists\n\n【216】The total number of respondents from the public sector was 26pharmacists (53.8%) of them were males. The majority (73%) of respondents graduated within or after 1991. Most (69%) of them had studied in Sudan. Surprisingly，(57%) of pharmacists(53.8% male) were employed in private at some time in the past before joining the public sector. This is due to the fact some of the current pharmacy managers in Federal and Khartoum State Departments of Pharmacy had private sector experience. The top three reasons that de-motivate pharmacists who had expe-rience with the private were lack of ownership feeling (21.4%)， sense of working for a specific person (21.4%) and job dissatis-faction (14.3%). Most (80.8%) of respondents joined the public sector due to job satisfaction and feeling of ownership (65.4%) as illustrated in Table .3. In answering the question： Do you have the intention to leave the public sector at some time in the future?'(61.5%) Of respondents answered Yes’. The vast major-ity (87.5%) of them owing to their intention to leave for better benefits in the private sector compared with the public sector as given in Table .4. Table .5 shows (69.2%) of the respondents mentioned monetary issues as one of the reasons discourages them from continuing with the public sector.\n\n【217】Private Sector Pharmacists\n\n【218】The number of respondents from the private sector was 54(80%) of them were male.

In answering the question Why did you leave the public sector?(51.4%) Of respondents had left the public sector because policy-makers did not care of pharmacy . The main reasons for choosing the private sectors mentioned by respondents are the salaries (61.8%)； the job satisfaction (52.9%) and the vehicle (26.5%) are shown in Table .6 and Figure 2.\n\n【220】A substantial percentage (78.4%) of the respondents answer yes\" to the question： thinking about your job；could you leave the private and join the public sector at some time in the future?

Without motivated， competent，and well-funded pharmacy workforces， there is a dangerous infu-sion of money for establishing drugs revolving funds in different states. To address the national problem of access to essential medicines will be either misused or wasted or both.\n\n【234】Challenges concerning pharmacy human resources varied significantly between and within states and associated with the political commitment of the states' government and their min-isters of health. The public sectors' pharmacists in many states are adversely affected by severing under-investment from the states and national funds， as well as external sources. For exam-ple， pharmacy budget from World Health Organisation (WHO) reduced from US$ 200，000 in 2003 to only US$ 93，000 in 2004. Driven by financial limitations， pharmacy workforces planning at federal and states ministries of health has been unable to match pharmacists requirements， the needs of the community and the health system as a whole.\n\n【235】It has been quite evident the civil service management sys-tem is detrimental to the retention of skilled pharmacists. Like other disciplines， the service affair authority determines the number of pharmacists' jobs in the public sector. It also sets salary scale and other incentives schemes in coordination with the Federal Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning. Al-though health professionals in hospitals tend to work in shifts and have to face different working conditions， the incentive sys-\n\n【236】Table 9 What encourages you to join the public sector?(N=43)\n\n| Reasons  | Percent  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Monetary issues  | 64.5  |\n| Dim vision  | 51.6  |\n| Instability feeling  | 38.7  |\n| Lack of job satisfaction  | 19.4  |\n| Political issues  | 12.9  |\n| Others\\  | 1.5  |\n| \\Government neglects pharmacists and the domination of doctors.  |  |\n\n【238】tem was not flexible enough to cope with differences between health professionals and other civil servants. Notably， the gap in the pharmacy workforces doesn’t generally relate to phar-macists， but to pharmacy assistants who constitute the bulk of the workforces. The difficulties caused by low pharmacy staff numbers are compounded by morale problems， skill balances and geographical mal-distribution， most of which are related to poor human resources management. How can the ministry of health grapple successfully with the demands of pharmaceutical care crises and the requirements of the transformed pharmacy profession， if it lacks the very foundation of pharmacy care -motivated， trained and supported pharmacists?\n\n【239】Mal-Distribution\n\n【240】Around 3000 pharmacists are registered in Sudan. Only 300(10%) works with the public sector. 25， 25， 20 pharmacists were employed in Khartoum， Khartoum North and Omdurman hos-pitals respectively. Some states (e.g.， Southern states has only two pharmacists) were not included in Table .9. This anomaly seems to imply the number of pharmacists in the public sector(hasn't only been insufficient in absolute terms， but also has been inefficient in its distribution). This number will be depleted， and the situation may be getting worse. One reason is a migration to the private sector.\n\n【241】Working Conditions\n\n【242】Sudan like many developing countries， the essential work-ing conditions are not met. Social or personal development opportunities are limited. Therefore， it is difficult for health pro-fessionals in general and pharmacists， in particular， to remain satisfied. The poor working conditions， remuneration and other factors pushed pharmacists out of the public sector.\n\n【243】To be successful， user fee mechanisms must generally be accompanied by perceived quality improvements in services. The World Bank suggests the increase in the quality of services would compensate the negative impact of prices. This implies that improved supply mechanisms for drugs are both prereq uisites and outputs of successful programmes. The adequately designed cost recovery programmes can encourage higher de-mand for modern health care and， as a result， a higher level of utilisation. If all are true， it is unsurprising the usage of Sudan health services in the public sector was low during the 1980s and personnel， especially in peripheral health facilities， idle most\n\n| State  | Number of pharmacists  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Department of Pharmacy (DOP) Khartoum State\\  | 8  |\n| DOP-North Darfur  | 7  |\n| DOP-Sennar  | 2  |\n| DOP-North Kordofan  | 5  |\n| DOP-South Kordofan  | 7  |\n| DOP-White Nile  | 2  |\n| DOP-Kassala  | 7  |\n| DOP-River Nile  | 3  |\n| DOP-Northern State  | 3  |\n| DOP-Al Gezira\\  | 6  |\n| Total\\\\  | 50  |\n| \\The Pharmacists who work with Revolving Drug Funds are not included. \\\\Information about other States is not available (10 Southern states， 2 Darfur states， 2 Eastern states， 1 Blue Nile state， and 1 West Kordofan state).  |  |\n\n【245】of the time. In 1992， Sudan had introduced cost recovery mea-sures as a part of its programme of economic reforms， following a course is taken by many developing countries. During the1990's， Sudan initiated some initiatives to establish medicine financing mechanisms as part of the health reform process and decentralised decision-making at the state level. In 1992， the government abolished the constitutional right to free health care. There is interest by the states to introduce a medicine financing mechanism based on the Revolving Drug Fund (RDF) experi-ence of Khartoum State(KS).\n\n【246】Conclusion and Recommendation\n\n【247】The study reveals the need for further research to find out how competent the regulatory authorities at both federal and state levels are. The research also needed to discover whether or not counterfeit medicines are sold on the Sudanese market. From the data obtained in this article some general inferences could be made：\n\n【248】1\\. The brad outlines remain intact， but preventing drug smug-gling across national borders (Sudan shares frontiers with nine countries) is hard to police.\n\n【249】2\\. The enforcement of the Act and its regulation governing the manufacture， importation， sale， distribution and expor-tation of medicines are not adequate to control the illegal importation and sale of medicines in Sudan.\n\n【250】3\\. The splitting of the drug regulatory authority between two ministries and the marketing of unregistered medicines by public drug suppliers (namely the CMSPO， and RDFs)，and NGOs undermine the quality of medicines and ultimately jeopardise the health of the people taking medication.\n\n【251】In the light of the findings the following recommendations could be useful at various levels：\n\n【252】1\\. There is an urgent need for the government to implement the provisions of the existing Act.\n\n【253】2\\. The government should adequately equip and fund the National drug Analysis laboratories to start active post-marketing surveillance.\n\n【254】3\\. A more spirited effort need to be made by the FGDOP and the States'Departments of Pharmacy to ensure all the medicines on the pharmacies' shelves are registered and come from legal sources.\n\n【255】4\\. The states' departments of pharmacies are not in existence should be re-established and invigorated. They should be adequately funded to be able to acquire the necessary facilities for their operations.\n\n【256】5\\. The CMSPO should stop the importation， manufacture and distribution of unregistered medicines. It should also cease selling the tenders' product to the private pharmacies. The latter practice undermines the inspection outcomes because it makes inspectors task too difficult (i.e.， cannot identify the source of medicine whether it is CMSPO or not).\n\n【257】The public sector is rigid， bureaucratic personnel-management practices，low incentives， poor job satisfaction and unsupportive work environment compared to the private sector. Such situa-tion demoralised pharmacists and encourages them to join the private sector. Many (65%) of surveyed private-sector pharma-cists claimed they were public sector pharmacists migrated to the private sector. Although information on migration is sparse， anecdotal evidence persuasively underscores the problem. In-ternal flow of pharmacists plagues all states since pharmacists move from poorer states to wealthier ones and from the pub-lic sector to the private. Strategies to meet current and future challenges in pharmacy human resources are urgently needed. Approaches that focus on the training of individuals， which do not take into account the job satisfaction (i.e. the nature of\n\n【258】the work itself) and pharmacists' mobility， can enjoy only lim-ited success. Increased production alone cannot compensate for weak motivation， high attrition and increasing mobility. To reverse decades of neglect， policy-makers in both (state and fed-eral level) should begin now， first by recognising the problem and secondly by fixing it through the immediate implementation of potentially effective strategies. Although we do not advocate the creation of new barriers to the movement of pharmacists between private and public sectors， steps should be taken to redress the unbalanced situation.\n\n【259】Ten immediate steps are recommended：\n\n【260】·Large-scale advocacy is needed to achieve heightened polit-ical awareness within states and at the federal level. One potential outcome of large-scale movement would be the beginnings of the introduction of pharmacy care concept， which reshapes the pharmacy services around the patients in hospitals and community pharmacies. This concept will benefit the healthcare system users and motivate pharma-cists to do a good job to their clients and employers. The em-ployers need to foster an organisational culture that recog-nises and values staff contribution. Central to the delivery of effective recognition are employees'immediate bosses， where a participative and considerate management style is shown as a significant predictive factor of retention.\n\n【261】·The Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) needs to learn from the experience of Khartoum， Red Sea， Northern， and the Al-gadarif States and current Gezira State then， identify success stories. Pharmacists and their organisations， and Ministries of Health have not remained passive in confronting the crisis in pharmacy workforces. The goodwill and commit-ment of public sector pharmacists to provide quality care despite low wages (30% of the average private salary) and medicines supply shortages at times of appalling conditions should not be overlooked.\n\n【262】· Pharmacist job satisfaction： Job satisfaction is how people feel about their jobs. Experiencing job dissatisfaction leads to withdrawal cognition and employee turnover. Job dis-satisfaction can be caused in many ways， including high centralisation， routinisation， low integration， low commu-nication and policy knowledge. Pharmacy education has a crucial role in preparing pharmacy student for practice and must anticipate the changing professional role. New strategies need to be developed with the participation of pharmacy professionals associations， unions， universities and ministries of health and higher education representa-tives to meet both； the short-term and long-term needs of pharmacists as pharmacy care providers. Technology will， no doubt give the opportunity to join postgraduate studies(e.g.，P.G. diploma or M.Sc. courses) from overseas via e-learning or continuing pharmacy professional development programmes.\n\n【263】·Salaries and incentives structure： This includes the pro-cess of creating new jobs， addressing low wages， as well as developing incentives structure that supports pharmacists over the course of their working lives. To stem the flow of pharmacists to the private sector and increase their per-formance， the Ministry of Health needs to pay incentives to its pharmacy staff on a semi-private basis. Introduc-tion of the employment contract and the application of the incentive budget line opposite performance proved to be effective in Khartoum State experience. The obligations of each part (employer and employee) should be written in a\n\n【264】non-ambiguous language， and transparent reward system should be in place. When transparency of reward system is poor， its credibility will be questioned， and pharmacists might not respond to the explicit incentive system at all. IDS， 2000 pointed out the lack of training， and potential ca-reer development is a particularly significant contributor to voluntary resignations. Uncompetitive pay is often debated as a reason for employee turnover. The perception of receiv-ing a fair salary is a determinant of retention. It seems to be essential both at the recruitment stage and subsequently as a determinant of retention rates is the perception that employees are receiving a fair salary. It is important to note this doesn't necessarily equate to a large salary since people often compare themselves with peers in the same occupa-tions or with friends and family rather than with better paid or higher skilled workers. Also， when promises are broken， and expectations are perceived (haven’t been met)， employees take actions to withdraw from the organisation， which may include quitting jobs.\n\n【265】· Pharmacy staff motivation： In addition to financial incen-tives， the Ministry of Health should continue to invest in improving the working conditions to ensure the suitably qualified and skilled pharmacists are retained for longer periods. Recruitment of qualified pharmacists (which may include looking outside the public services). A clear def-inition of job assignments (staff at hospitals' level enter into written contracts to perform according to MOH guide-lines) and regular supervision will assist MOH to achieve a good staff performance. MOH should provide transport to pharmacists (senior and specialised pharmacists could be offered private vehicles) from their residence to the place of work to increase their motivation. Company-paid pri-vate medical insurance and a company car for senior staff， child day care facilities， pension and retirement plans are the most desired and lead to employee retention.\n\n【266】·Redistribution of Pharmacy workforces： To address the problems of the pharmacy profession in Sudan， an increase in access to essential medicines is insufficient. Far more important is the need to strengthen the pharmacy workforce in localities， states and federal health institutions to address the challenges and to use the resources and interventions for the provision of effective pharmaceutical services.\n\n【267】· A small staff and efficient teamwork： The pharmacy work-forces are divided into two levels 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Department of phar-macies at the Ministry of Health， and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Hospitals. The Department of Pharmacy at the state level should consist of 6 pharmacists at maximum and 25 at the federal depart-ment of pharmacy including drug analysis laboratory. The hospitals' department of pharmacies classified as follows：(i) Group A includes big hospitals (e.g.， Khartoum and Om-durman hospitals). The numbers of pharmacists in Group A hospitals are 15 pharmacists in addition to pharmacy assistants and other support staff to cover all shifts. One manager， three pharmacist work in Drug Information Cen-tre， three for internal hospital pharmacy， two in outpatient pharmacy， three in people pharmacy and one in clinical pharmacist；\n\n【268】(ii) Group B includes medium hospitals and capital cities hospitals (e.g.，Ibrahim Malik， and Medani Hospitals). The Hospital Pharmacy Department (HPD) this group managed by 4 to 6 pharmacists；\n\n【269】(iii) Group C includes small and rural hospitals. Two phar-\n\n【270】macists could run the HPD in these hospitals. Paying atten-tion to create more flexible and efficient system for PHRs management in the government institutions might help improve the condition of shortages of pharmacists in the public sector. The advantages of small staff can be easily managed， trained and financed， and teamwork could be developed. This also improves the performance and pro-ductivity of the public sector pharmacists thereby reduce the number of PHRs needed to provide satisfactory pharma-ceutical services in the public sector institutions. The best indicators of staff retention are the fostering of friendships at work， and managers in health cares should take time to get know people and foster opportunities for friendship and socialising.\n\n【271】·National leadership at the highest level is essential and will only come to heighten the awareness of the fundamental importance of pharmacists in health care in general and in the pharmaceutical care in particular， and the development of new methods and strategies.\n\n【272】·Continuing pharmacy professional development： The es-sential element of National Drug Policy (NDP) and 25 years pharmacy strategy has yet to be tackled. MOH should fully recognise its 25 years pharmacy strategy goals could be achieved through people's (especially pharmacists) exper-tise. Appropriate training and development is the key to reach those goals and make strategy visions become a real-ity. A wide variety of external (e.g.， distance or e-learning in the developed world) and internal training and develop-ment programmes for pharmacists should be introduced. A pharmacist’s career or pathway should be developed. A policy for active selection of training fields should be formu-lated according to the priorities of health care needs. The career development relies on individual training and devel-opment to enable employees to move into more challenging roles and can provide enhanced rewards for those who are promoted.\n\n【273】·PPharmacy staff discipline and accountability system： Dis-ciplinary procedures， which provide a range of possible responses (from warnings through dismissal， depending on the severity and frequency of the offence should be clearly stated in the new work contracts). Pharmacy managers and team leaders in different settings (administration or care provided， at both state and federal levels) should be trained to invoke disciplinary procedures and to bring criminal charges when necessary.\n\n【274】Improving the effectiveness of the public pharmacy is by switching resources towards areas of need， reducing inequalities and promoting better health. Unless there are clear incentives for pharmacists， they can move away from the public sector.\n\n【275】Findings innovative approaches to stop the brain drain of the pharmacists from the public sector and to increase their produc-tivity and performance might be more appropriate strategies to solve the problem in Sudan. These strategies comprise， for instance， monitory incentives， continuing professional devel-opment， working condition and job satisfaction of civil service PHRs.\n\n【276】The study may help the Ministry of Health to formulate more relevant and useful policies better and plans to retain qualified and skilled pharmacists in the public sector on a solid evidence base. Monitoring and evaluation of information provided to MOH.\n\n【277】The data must be accurate and up to date. The study revealed low salaries， job dissatisfaction about the pharmacy practice and bureaucracy， working conditions， lack of recognition for contribution at work， and lack of professional development training programmes are the main factors influencing the brain drain of the PHRs.\n\n【278】These factors affect PHRs immigration and retention concur-rently rather than in isolation.\n\n【279】Given the time constraints required to get the new contract-ing arrangements in place， there is a risk that good practice developments in options for change for change field sites may not be used effectively (continue to evaluate and disseminate the lessons that emerge from these sites).\n\n【280】Ethical Clearance and Data Protection Consent\n\n【281】Before starting the data collection， ethical clearance was ob-tained from the Federal Ministry of Health (MOH)-Research Ethics Committee. The first author signed the data protection consent， and the respondents were informed it was an anony-mous questionnaire and all the data collected are for the FGDOP assessment purpose. Nevertheless， the participants were also informed the data processing would not be used to support any decision-making and would not cause any damage， and distress them or to their business.\n\n【282】Research Limitations\n\n【283】The selection of one group of stakeholders and ignorance of the rest (such as the CMSPO， retail pharmacies， drug manufacturers， NGOs， consumers organisations， policy-makers，regulators， po-lice， customs， doctors， other healthcare professionals， and health professional unions， etc.) were not included. This means great caution must be exercised in any extrapolation to a country level statistical analysis， and percentage given must be regarded as rough estimates.\n\n【284】Reliability and Validity of the Research instrument\n\n【285】The sample chosen is indicative rather than fully representative and has been sized to be feasible in the time and resources available for the authors.

These changes typically cause pain and loss of exocrine and endocrine pancreatic function. Modified Puestow is the best available method to relieve the symptoms associated with chronic pancreatitis， especially pain. As a consultant， I performed my first modified Puestow in February 1993 and found excellent results without any consecutive 27 years. In a later era， I operated only on those patients who were failed in endoscopic management. Materials and Methods： From February 1993 to January 2019， we did multiple procedures as per case demand in chronic pancreatitis. Forty-nine cases of chronic pancreatitis were operated on for modified Puestow. All selected patients had haematological and radiological workup. MRCP of all patients showing dilated pancreatic duct more than 7mm. in size. Follow up after surgery was done from one year to 27 years. Results： All 49 patients in the short term to long term follow up were recovered well from pain and abdominal discomfort. Appetite improved，and weight gain noted in the patients after surgery. Conclusions： Modified Puestow is still a safe， timely and straightforward approved procedure for pain associated with chronic pancreatitis.\n\n【5】KEYWORDS chronic pancreatitis with lithiasis， Partington and Rochelle pancreaticojejunostomy Modified Puestow's\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】The most common symptom of chronic pancreatitis is pain， which can be severe and intractable in some patients.

Forty-three were men， and six were women.\n\n【24】Out of 43 men， 36 had alcoholic pancreatitis， and five had gall stone biliary pancreatitis remaining 2 had idiopathic aetiology. One male patient (65 years old) had the recurrent formation of pancreatic duct calculi after 18 yrs. of previously inadequately performed Puestow’s surgery by another institution.\n\n【25】Out of 6 female，5 had biliary pancreatitis， and 1 from Kerala had tropical pancreatitis.\n\n【26】All these patients were evaluated for aetiology characteristic of pain， abdominal discomfort and weight loss.\n\n【27】In all 49 patients， severe pain with hampered routine activity was the main symptom. Associated symptoms were loss of appetite， belching， gaseous distension and weight loss. Weight loss was significant 10 to 15% of body weight in 3 to 4 months in all patients.\n\n【28】The Wong-Baker FACES pain rating scale'system was used for assessment and improvement in pain.\n\n【29】A complete haematological check-up was done in all patients. Serum Amylase and Lipase were normal in 38 patients and mildly elevated in 11 patients. MRI (MRCP) was done in all patients， showing pancreatic ductal size from 7mm to 15mm. With multiple pancreatic ductal calculi. ERCP pancreatic ductal clearance tried and could not achieve complete clearance in 10patients， and they were remained symptomatic. Four patients were needed endoscopic bile duct clearance before surgery. All patients received conservative management for six months and not responded to it.\n\n【30】Modified Puestow (Longitudinal Pancreatico-jejunostomy)\n\n【31】Preparation for surgery\n\n【32】Standard preoperative medications are given before longitu-dinal (lateral) pancreaticojejunostomy (LPJ；Modified Puestow procedure) may include proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).\n\n【33】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1： ERCP showing large dilated pancreatic duct.</u>\n\n【34】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2： Recurrent pancreatic duct calculi at head.</u>\n\n【35】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3： Diagramatic representation of Modified Puestow surgery.</u>\n\n【36】Preoperative administration of a broad-spectrum antibiotic with adequate coverage against gram-negative enteric organ-isms is recommended. Commonly， prophylaxis takes the form of a third-generation cephalosporin (Injection Ceftriaxone 1 gm.) administered at the time of induction. Another dose was re-peated after the surgery. Patients with other risk factors or comorbidities were given a complete five days course of an-tibiotics.\n\n【37】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4： Patient with recurrent stones in the pancreatic duct.</u>\n\n【38】Incision and exploration\n\n【39】The preferred incisions were bilateral subcostal (chevron) or a midline. A chevron incision allows better exposure of the pancreatic tail in patients whose pancreas has a more vertical orientation. A midline incision was preferred in lean and thin individuals with a narrow coastal angle.\n\n【40】After the exploration first step is to confirm the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and rule out malignancy.\n\n【41】The pancreas of a patient with chronic pancreatitis had a firm fibrotic feel， which was evident throughout the gland. In addition， in some cases， parenchymal calcification was obvious， or pancreatic calculi are palpable in the dilated duct.\n\n【42】A wide Kocher manoeuvre is mentioned in modified Puestow's were never needed in our cases.\n\n【43】Exposure of anterior surface of the pancreas\n\n【44】After thorough exploration， the entire anterior surface of the pancreas was completely exposed. With care taken to spare the gastroepiploic vessels， the lesser sac was opened with ligation and division of the gastrocolic omentum. The gastrocolic liga-ment was divided as far to the left as possible (almost reaching the hilum of the spleen) in order to completely expose the tail of the pancreas. The transverse colon retracted down.\n\n【45】Complete separation of the pancreas from the stomach was achieved so that the stomach can be retracted up completely for placement of the sutures during the longitudinal pancreatico-jejunal anastomosis.\n\n【46】Special attention was paid to identifying the superior mesen-teric vein (SMV) within the fibrosed adhesions and avoiding avulsion of the branches of this vessel. The pancreatic head was palpated for stone. Identification and opening of the pancreatic duct\n\n【47】By palpation and aspiration with a 20-gauge needle yielding clear pancreatic juice. We took an incision over the needle to enter into the pancreatic duct.\n\n【48】In cases where stones were palpable， the pancreatic parenchyma is cut on the duct in the area of the stone to gain access to the duct. The stones are then retrieved from the open duct. Pancreatic calculi being retrieved from the dilated pancre-atic duct.\n\n【49】Complete pancreatic duct clearance was the main aim after ductotomy.\n\n【50】Final Anastomosis：\n\n【51】Roux-y wide and adequately long (minimal of 8cm. onwards) pacreatico-jejunostomy was done with 4/0 polyglactic acid ma-terial with interrupted or continuous sutures depending upon pancreatic tissue friability.\n\n【52】For patients who had biliary pancreatitis， additional cholecys-tectomies were performed. Single abdominal 28 number drain kept for all patients. One advantage of this procedure com-pared to Frey's procedure is that pancreatic tissue is preserved， which may be of critical importance in patients with exocrine or endocrine insufficiency from their chronic pancreatitis.\n\n【53】Postoperative care\n\n【54】Nasogastric decompression was continued postoperatively until bowel function resumes. Oral intake was resumed as after 3days.\n\n【55】Results\n\n【56】Table 1 clearly shows male predominance 83.67% with com-monest aetiological factor is alcohol 73.46%， followed by biliary calculi 20.40%， and other causes are 6.12%.\n\n【57】Table 2 shows symptomatology before and after surgery. The pain was relieved immediately postoperative in all 49(100%). The Wong-Baker FACES pain rating score was above 6 for all patients who improved to 0-2.\n\n【58】Weight loss was in 45 patients； after the surgery， 37 (82%) patients gain weight to normal.\n\n【59】Malabsorption related symptoms were present in 31 patients， out of which 26(84%) patients had a good recovery. Fluctuation in sugar levels observed in 12 patients despite regular adjust-ment of antidiabetic drug doses. However， after the surgery， it was easy to control their diabetes mellitus with suitable fix antidiabetic drugs.\n\n【60】22 (44.89%) patients had 7-9mm.，18 (36.73%) had 9-12mm.， 8(16.32%) had 12-15mm.and only one (2%) had 17mm pancreatic duct size. The complications rate was very low and were never life-threatening.\n\n【61】Discussion\n\n【62】Pain is the predominant symptom in chronic pancreatitis；80-90% of patients present with pain as the primary symptom either at the first attack of acute pancreatitis or as the main rea-son for hospital readmissions in the following months and years， as the disease progresses to what could be defined as chronic pancreatitis.\n\n【63】The formations of stones in chronic pancreatitis are caused by the crystallization and deposition of calcium carbonate as long as alcohol and CP cause hyper saturation of pancreatic juice with calcium. The diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis is set by clin-ical means and imaging modalities. On plain X-ray， pancreatic calcifications are detected in 30% of CP patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Abdom-inal ultrasound has limited value， but computed tomography(CT) scan provides detailed imaging of pancreatic stones. Endo-scopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and mag-netic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) are valuable ODancr adjuncts to evaluating the exact location of the calculi and duct system anatomy. Moreover， ERCP may be therapeutic if the stones are extracted.\n\n【64】Table 1 Gender and aetiology\n\n| Gender andaetiology  | alcoholic  | biliary  | others  | total  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| male  | 36  | 5  | 2  | 41  |\n| female  | 0  | 5  | 1  | 06  |\n| total  | 36  | 10  | 3  | 49  |\n\n【66】Table 2 Percentage of relief of symptoms post-operatively.\n\n| Gender and symptomatology  | Before painafter no pain  |  | Before weight loss/after weight gain  |  | Gaseous distensionand malabsorption Before yes after no  |  | Fluctuation in sugar levelbefore yes after no  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | before  | after  | before  | after  | before  | after  | before  | after  |\n| male  | 43  | 43  | 40  | 32  | 28  | 24  | 10  | 10  |\n| female  | 6  | 6  | 5  | 5  | 3  | 2  | 2  | 2  |\n| total  | 49  | 49  | 45  | 37  | 31  | 26  | 12  | 12  |\n\n【68】Table 3 Size of the pancreatic duct on MRCP.\n\n| Gender and size  | 7-9mm  | 9-12mm  | 12-15mm  | \\>15mm  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| male  | 20  | 15  | 7  | 1  |\n| female  | 2  | 3  | 1  | 0  |\n| total  | 22  | 18  | 8  | 1  |\n\n【70】Table 4 Complications of surgery\n\n| Complications  | Number of patients  |\n| --- | --- |\n| On table haemorrhages  | 4 -required blood transfusion  |\n| Pancreatic ascites  | 1  |\n| Wound site infection  | 5  |\n| Splenic vein damage  | l splenectomy done  |\n\n【72】Table 5 Surgical procedures performed in chronic pancreatitis\n\n| Decompression/drainage operations  | Resection procedures  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy(modifiedPuestow procedure)  | pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure)  |  |\n| Lateral pancreaticojejunostomy  | Beger procedure (duodenum-preserving pancreatichead resection)  |  |\n| Lateral pancreaticoduodenostomy  | Frey procedure (resection of the pancreatic head withlongitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy)  |  |\n| Pancreatic pseudocyst drainage  |  |  |\n\n【74】In older randomized trials is demonstrated that surgical ther-apy turns to have more durable results and results in pain re-lief for longer intervals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Due to further development of endoscopic techniques， endoscopic therapy is usually the first preferred option because of less invasiveness. Positive response to endoscopic treatment is a predictor of good surgical results when the operative approach is administered in the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Endoscopic stone removal is attempted when upstream pan-creatic duct dilatation is present. However， pancreatic stones are harder and speculated compared to bile duct stones， and these features explain why pancreatic stones imply difficulties for extraction. Endoscopic stone removal is successful in 50% of cases with standard techniques 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【75】The decision for surgical therapy depends on many factors：pancreatic duct diameter， duct strictures， pain severity indexes， malignancy concerns， associated biliary duct obstruction and operative risk. Resection， drainage and decompression and com-bination procedures have been described. Regarding surgical treatment，lateral pancreaticojejunostomy or modified Puestow procedure is the most common and well-studied surgical tech-nique for such cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. It is successful in chronic pancreatitis without an inflammatory mass in the pancreas head for pain relief in 90% of patients and is suited for pancreatic ducts>8mm \\[20J. The pancreatic leak is low (0.03-5%) in appropriately selected patients with a fibrotic gland 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Postoperative mor-tality rate and disease incidence of patients who underwent the Partington-Rochelle procedure were lower than among those who had the original Puestow procedure， at approximately 3%and 20%， respectively \\[21.22\\].\n\n【76】Surgical treatment of the pain of chronic pancreatitis：\n\n【77】Many operations have been described. They can be divided into decompression and drainage procedures and resection pro-cedures. The primary indication for surgical intervention in.11chronic pancreatitis is severe， unremitting pain resistant to other measures. Examples of the commonly used surgical procedures in the management of chronic pancreatitis are shown in Table 5.\n\n【78】Drainage procedures are performed when there is a widely di-lated main pancreatic duct (>6-7 mm)， and the most commonly performed operation is longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy (the modified Puestow procedure). Short-term pain relief is achieved in up to 80% of patients， with pain relief persisting for more than two years in 60% of patients.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> In our study， all patients had a pancreatic duct size of more than 7mm. We got instant relief in 100% of patients， weight gain in 82% of patients and relief from abdominal discomfort symptoms in 84% of cases. In a diabetic patient， sugar was controlled well with steady doses of antidiabetic drugs after surgery. Follow up from last one year to twenty-seven years without any pain and enjoying a comfortable lifestyle. Five elderly patients of age more than 65 died later due to cirrhosis of the liver and Five due to other reasons， but they never experienced pain due to chronic pancreatitis. We found that complication rates are very low and easily manageable.\n\n【79】Conclusion\n\n【80】Chronic pancreatitis， and the pain associated with it， is a com-plex clinical syndrome that has a devastating effect on those who suffer from it. Despite the numerous causes and multi-ple theories of pathogenesis， the common feature throughout a diverse group of patients is pain， pain that some describe as unbearable， relentless and all-consuming. It is a pain that\n\n【81】dominates every aspect of the life of a patient with chronic pan-creatitis. It is a disease process that commonly leads to multiple hospital admissions， associated complications (diabetes， mal-nutrition， pseudocysts). There is a wide range of treatments available to ameliorate the symptoms of chronic pancreatitis. Primary-care physicians， gastroenterologists， anesthesiologists， pancreatic surgeons， pain specialists all have important roles in its management. A multi-disciplinary approach is fundamental to improving treatment and outcome in this field.\n\n【82】However， when a patient does not respond to any conserva-tive management， some kind of drainage procedure could help the patient. In our series， we found that Modified Puestow’s lon-gitudinal pacreatico-jejunostomy gives excellent results from all symptomatology with improvement in lifestyle. Patients with the large pancreatic duct that failed the endoscopic approach should undergo Modified Puestow's surgery.\n\n【83】Funding\n\n【84】This research received no grant from any funding agency or any private sector.\n\n【85】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of interest</u>\n\n【86】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There are no conflicts of interest to declare by any of the authors of this study.</u>\n\n【87】通用结尾删除-1:<u>References</u>\n\n【88】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

Pregnancies in women with this disorder are of-ten associated with adverse outcomes， including miscarriage， premature labor， and hemorrhage during preg nancy and in the peripartum period. The literature on this disorder is sparse and shows a limited number of successful pregnancies in women with factor X deficiency.\n\n【17】Case Report： In this report， we present the case of a successful pregnancy and term delivery by elective cesarean section in a\n\n【18】39-year-old primigravida with congenital factor X deficiency. Medical management followed the recommenda-tions of an interdisciplinary team comprising specialists in obstetrics， anesthesia， transfusion medicine，hema-tology， and neonatology. This high-risk pregnancy was successfully brought to term， and a healthy male neonate was delivered by elective cesarean section at 39 weeks' gestation. The patient's factor X deficiency (0.19 klU/L) was treated using 4 units of solvent-detergent-treated fresh frozen plasma (SD-FFP) 1 h before the cesarean section， leading to hemostatic levels of factor X and an uneventful intraoperative course. Postoperatively， the patient's factor X levels were controlled daily and corrected using SD-FFP as needed， with no clinically signifi-\n\n【19】cant blood loss.\n\n【20】Conclusions：\n\n【21】SD-FFP can be used to manage congenital factor X deficiency in the peripartum period and maintain perioper-ative blood loss within normal limits.\n\n【22】MeSH Keywords： Factor X Deficiency · Pregnancy Complications， Hematologic· Pregnancy， High-Risk\n\n【23】Full-text PDE https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/920685\n\n【24】口2188 \\]2 山白 12\n\n【25】Factor X is a vitamin K-dependent serum protease synthe sized in the liver 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>.

Four of these 31 (13%) resulted in miscarriage， 4/31 (13%) were associated with vaginal bleeding during pregnancy， 6/31(22%) led to postpartum hemorrhage， and 8 of the successful preg-nancies (8/27； 30%) involved preterm delivery (<37 weeks) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【28】In the present report， we present a successful pregnancy and term delivery by elective cesarean section in a 39-year-old pri-migravida with congenital factor X deficiency whose peripar-tum factor X levels were increased using solvent-detergent-treated fresh frozen plasma (SD-FFP).\n\n【29】Case Report\n\n【30】A 39-year-old nulliparous woman was referred to our tertiary care center because she had a known history of factor X defi-ciency. Her coagulation disorder was diagnosed at the age of\n\n【31】18 years during a routine preoperative assessment for an elec-tive tonsillectomy. Once discovered， the elective surgery was postponed and molecular diagnostics were performed. These showed that the patient was heterozygous for 2 mutations：MTHFR C677T and PAI-1 4G/5G. Subsequently， other family members were also tested， and it was found that both the patient's sister and nephew were heterozygous for the same mutations； all of these patients had factor X levels of 0.5 klU/L and were therefore diagnosed with mild factor X deficiency.\n\n【32】When asked about her medical history prior to diagnosis of fac-tor X deficiency， the patient reported reoccurring heavy men-strual bleeding， without increased incidence of other signs and symptoms related to her factor X deficiency (i.e.，epistaxis， pete-chiae， hematoma formation， and bruising) and denied other chronic comorbidities. Moreover， no additional bleeding， apart from reoccurring heavy menstrual bleeding， was noticed between the time of diagnosis and the following medical procedures.\n\n【33】At the age of 37 years， the patient underwent a tooth extrac-tion， which was monitored by a transfusion specialist. During that procedure， her coagulation test showed a prothrombin time (PT) of 0.51， an international normalized ratio (INR) of1.4， an activated thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 37.06 s， and a factor X level of 0.25 kIU/L， which prompted the transfusion specialist to recommend administering 10 mL/kg of FFP be-fore the procedure. The procedure was then carried out un-der local anesthesia. No intra- or post-operative complications were reported， and the patient was discharged from the hos-pita! the following day\n\n【34】At the age of 38 years， the patient experienced her first preg nancy， which ended in miscarriage at 8 weeks. Due to heavy vaginal bleeding and lack of fetal cardiac activity， medical abortion was performed with 400 mg of misoprostol (Stada， VietNam-Singapore Industrial Park， Binh Duong， Singapore)， administered buccally. No bleeding complications were re-ported and the clinical course did not require administration of FFP or coagulation factors.\n\n【35】The patient's second pregnancy occurred at the age of 39years and was closely monitored by the obstetrician and he-matologists with regular follow-up appointments. No bleeding complications occurred during the pregnancy. However， poly-hydramnion and gestational diabetes developed， with the lat-ter being well controlled with an appropriate diet. During the third trimester， a multidisciplinary team comprising specialists in obstetrics， anesthesia， transfusion medicine， hematology， and neonatology met and devised a thorough plan for safe delivery and postpartum period. The plan included scheduled admission to the hospital at 39 weeks， daily assessments of factor X levels with therapy adjusted accordingly， and term de-livery of the high-risk pregnancy by elective cesarean section.\n\n| Haematology tests  | Reference range(Sex： F)  | Admission  | Postoperative day：5th  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Erythrocytes (x1012/L)  | 3.86-5.08  | 4.55  | 3.99  |\n| Haemoglobin (g/L)  | 119-157  | 143  | 123  |\n| Haematocrit (cb，vb) (L/L)  | 0.356-0.470  | 0.431  | 0.372  |\n| MCV (fL)  | 83.0-97.2  | 94.9  | 93.3  |\n| MCH (pg)  | 27.4-33.9  | 31.4  | 30.9  |\n| MCHC (gL)  | 320-345  | 331  | 331  |\n| RDW (%)  | 9.0-15.0  | 13.4  | 13.4  |\n| HDW (g/L)  | 22.0-32.0  | 26.6  |  |\n| Thrombocytes (x10/L)  | 158-424  | 171  | 140L  |\n| MPV (fL)  | 6.8-10.4  | 9.7  | 10.0  |\n| Leukocytes (x10°/L)  | 3.4-9.7  | 11.1H  | 12.6H  |\n| Neutrophil granulocytes (x10/L)  | 2.06-6.49  | 8.40H  | 10.6H  |\n| Lymphocytes (x10/L)  | 1.19-3.35  | 1.80  | 1.20  |\n| Monocytes (x10/L)  | 0.12-0.84  | 0.50  | 0.60  |\n| Eozinophil Granulocytes (x10/L)  | 0-0.43  | 0.10  | 0.00  |\n| Basophil Granulocytes (x10°/L)  | 0-0.06  | 0.00  | 0.00  |\n| LUC (x109/L)  | 0-0.40  | 0.20  |  |\n| Neutrophil Granulocytes (rel%)  | 44-72  | 75.9H  | 84.6 H  |\n| Lymphocytes (rel%)  | 20-46  | 15.9L  | 9.9L  |\n| Monocytes (rel%)  | 2-12  | 4.8  | 5.0  |\n| Eozinophil Granulocytes (rel%)  | 0-7  | 0.8  | 0.1  |\n| Basophil Granulocytes (rel%)  | 0-1  | 0.4  | 0.4  |\n| LUC (rel%)  | 0-4  | 2.2  |  |\n|  | Haematology tests  | Admission  | Postoperative  |\n| Percentage of hypochromic red cells (% HYPO) (%)  | 0-2.5  | 1  |  |\n| Segment indeks  | 1.90-3.00  | 2.40  |  |\n| Biochemical analysis  | Reference range(Sex： F)  | Admission  | Postoperative  |\n| Glucose (s) (mmol/L)  | 4.4-6.4  | 4.6  |  |\n| Urea (s) (mmol/L)  | 2.8-8.3  | 2.0L  |  |\n| Creatinine (s) (mmol/L)  | 49-90  | 45L  |  |\n| eGFR CKD-EPI(mL/min/1.73 m³)  | \\>90  | 122  |  |\n| Sodium (Na) (s) (mmol/L)  | 137-146  | 139  |  |\n|  | 3.9-5.1  | 4.3  |  |\n| Chlorides (s) (mmol/L)  |  | 104  |  |\n|  | 97-108  | 104  |  |\n\n| Urinalysis  | Reference range (Sex： F)  | Admission  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Chemical examination  |  |  |\n| Specific gravity (kg/L)  | 1.002-1.030  | 1.020  |\n| pH  | 5.0-9.0  | 6.0  |\n| Leukocyte esterase (/)  | Neg  | Neg  |\n| Protein (/)  | Neg  | Neg  |\n| Glucose (/)  | Norm  | Norm  |\n| Ketones (/)  | Neg  | Pos \\[+\\]  |\n| Urobilinogen (/)  | Norm  | Norm  |\n| Bilirubin (/)  | Neg  | Neg  |\n| Nitrites (/)  | Neg  | Neg  |\n| Erythrocytes/Haemoglobin (/)  | Neg  | Neg  |\n| Microscopic examination  |  |  |\n| Sediment  |  | Low RBC and LBC content， an increased number of epithelial cells and crystals Ca-oxylates arepresent，and few bacterias  |\n| Visual examination  |  |  |\n|  | Clear  | Slightly cloudy  |\n| Urine clarity (/)  | Pale yellow  | Yellow  |\n\n【38】As scheduled， the patient was admitted to the hospital at 39weeks， weighing 90 kg and with BMI of 32 kg/m2. At that time， the first set of laboratory investigations was made . The patient's coagulation parameters included a prothrombin time of 0.48， an INR of 1.45， an acti-vated thromboplastin time of 36.5 s， and a factor X level of0.19 klU/L. Her levels of fibrinogen， factor ll， and factor VII were slightly elevated， and thrombelastography showed val-ues within the normal range .\n\n【39】Based on the patient's factor X levels， risk of bleeding during obstetric procedures， and the fact that heavy bleeding cannot be fully predicted in cases like this， we decided that she should receive 4 units of SD-FFP 1h before the elective cesarean sec-tion. Two other therapeutic options were discussed： applica-tion of recombinant factor X or prothrombin complex concen-trate (PCC). Although recombinant factor X would have been our first choice， it is， unfortunately， not available in our coun-try. On the other hand， we decided against PCC due to its pos-sible thrombogenic effect， which is especially pronounced in pregnancy. Administration of SD-FFP resulted in factor X lev-els of 0.41 klU/L at the time of the procedure (Table 2， time\n\n【40】point： preoperative). In addition， 2 units of packed red blood cells and 6 units of SD-FFP were placed on standby in case she developed bleeding complications during the procedure.\n\n【41】Because the patient had hemorrhagic diathesis， neuraxial anes-thesia might have led to complications. For this reason， the pa-tient was given general anesthesia. Propofol (MCT Fresenius， Bad Homburg， Germany) and rocuronium (MSD， Kenilworth， NJ， USA) were administered intravenously， followed by anesthe-sia and rapid-sequence intubation. Sevoflurane (AbbVieNorth Chicago， IL， USA) was then used to maintain anesthesia， and the obstetricians proceeded with the delivery. Several minutes later， a healthy baby boy was delivered， with an Apgar score of 7/9 and a weight of 3450 g. After the baby was delivered， the anesthesia was augmented with i.v. sufentanil (Hameln， Germany). Intraoperatively， the patient received 15 IU of i.v. oxy-tocin (Syntocinon； Mylan， Canonsburg， PA， USA)， 0.2 mg of i.v. methylergometrine (Demergin； Demo， Germany)， and 800 mg of misoprostol (Stada，VietNam-Singapore Industrial Park， Binh Duong， Singapore)， administered rectally. The rest of the pro-cedure was performed as planned， with no bleeding compli-cations and no need to administer additional blood products.\n\n|  | Postoperative day Reference January TestsAdmission Preoperativerange 2019 1st 2nd 3rd 4th  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Postoperative day Reference January TestsAdmission Preoperativerange 2019 1st 2nd 3rd 4th  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 5th  |\n|  | Prothrombin time 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>  | 0.70-1.40  | 0.45L  | 0.48L  | 0.62L  | 0.64L  | 0.62H  | 0.65 H  | 0.66L  | 0.63L  |\n|  | Prothrombin time - INR (INR)  |  | 1.50  | 1.45  | 1.27  | 1.24  | 1.27  | 1.24  | 1.23  | 1.26  |\n|  | Activated partial thromboplastine25.00-40.00time (s)  |  | 32.95  | 36.51  | 32.38  | 32.72  | 36.52  | 37.79  | 35.83  | 38.14  |\n|  | Activ. partial thromboplastine time-0.80-1.20R通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>  |  | 1.01  | 1.12  | 1.00  | 1.01  | 1.12  | 1.16  | 1.10  | 1.17  |\n|  | Fibrinogen (g/L) 1.80-4.00  |  | 6.58H  | 5.94H  | 5.59H  | 5.69H  | 5.65 H  | 6.2H  | 5.75H  | 5.27H  |\n|  | D-dimeri Innovance (FEU) (mg/L) <0.50  |  |  |  |  |  | 2.69H  | 1.58 H  | 1.69H  | 1.52H  |\n|  |  |  | 0.97  | 1.03  |  | 0.94  | 0.96  | 0.99  | 1.0  | 1.0  |\n|  |  |  | 1.75H  | 1.46H  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  | 1.27  | 1.12  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  | 1.99H  | 1.83 H  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  | 0.22L  | 0.19L  | 0.41L  | 0.30L  | 0.27L  | 0.32L  | 0.34L  | 0.33L  |\n| Thromboelastogram-R\\[min\\] 4.00-8.00  |  |  | 6.80  | 5.80  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Thromboelastogram-K\\[min\\] 0.00-4.00  |  |  | 1.80  | 1.30  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Thromboelastogram-alpha\\[o\\]  | 47.00-74.00  |  | 65.00  | 70.80  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Thromboelastogram-MA\\[mm\\]  |  | 54.00-72.00  | 68.00  | 72.40H  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Thromboelastogram-CL\\[1/1\\] -3.00-3.00  |  |  | 0.40  | 2.22  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n【43】After an uneventful stay in the postoperative care unit， the pa-tient was discharged to the high-dependency unit (HDU) of the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

Post-operatively， the patient received a total of 15 units of SD-FFP， with no significant blood loss. She and her healthy son were discharged from the hospital on day 7， with subsequent ambulatory follow-ups.\n\n【44】Discussion\n\n【45】The perioperative blood management approach used by our multidisciplinary team resulted in a successful term delivery and uneventful peripartum period in a patient with factor X defi-ciency， without significant bleeding or thrombotic complications.\n\n【46】Factor X deficiency is a rare inherited coagulopathy， manifest-ed as various degrees of bleeding diathesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.

Although the patient’s syntax score was high， we performed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on each vessel based on his request and in consideration of his dementia. After PCI for the left circumflex and descending arteries， we performed PCI for the right coronary artery (RCA) using optical frequency domain imag-ing (OFDI).

In this case report， we present a patient with multiple channel structures in the proxi-mal right coronary artery (RCA) observed by optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI).

The focus of this report is to demonstrate the utility of RA in the treatment of multi-ple channel structures observed by OFDI\n\n【23】Case Report\n\n【24】A 71-year-old male was admitted to our hospital due to bronchial pneumonia. At the time of admission， he was undergoing medi-cal treatment for hypertension， diabetes mellitus， dyslipidemia， old cerebral infarction， and Alzheimer’s disease. His blood pres-sure was 151/81 mmHg， pulse rate was 81 beats/minute，and body temperature was 37.0C. Chest computed tomography re-vealed bronchial wall thickening. We diagnosed bronchial pneu-monia and initiated antibiotics administration.On post-admis-sion day 2， he experienced acute decompensated heart failure. We determined afterload mismatch and diastolic dysfunction as\n\n【25】the cause of heart failure， indicated by a blood pressure read-ing of 242/107 mmHg. An electrocardiogram revealed a sinus rhythm strain pattern in the l， aVL， and V4-V6 leads. The echo-cardiography examination showed preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (62.8%)， diastolic dysfunction， and mild hypo-kinesis of the inferior wall. Treatment for heart failure was ini-tiated with a noninvasive positive pressure ventilator， vasodi-lator drugs， and diuretics. After improvement of the patient's symptoms， myocardial stress perfusion scintigraphy enabled the determination of the redistribution of inferior and lateral walls. Coronary angiogram (CAG) revealed severe stenosis lesions with heavy calcification at the proximal RCA ， proximal-mid left descending artery (LAD)， and a sub-total lesion at the proxi-mal left circumflex artery (LCX) . Although his syntax score was high (44.5)， we performed multi-vessel PCI based on the patient's request and after our consideration of his de-mentia and old cerebral infarction. We first performed PCl on the LCX and then for the LAD. Finally， we performed PCI on the RCA. For this， a 7-Fr guiding catheter (ASAHI Hyperion SAL-1.0SH， ASAHI INTECC， Aichi， Japan) was inserted into the RCA， and the guidewire (SION blue， ASAHI INTECC) easily passed through the lesion. We observed the lesion by OFDI catheter (Fast View， Terumo， Tokyo， Japan) . The multiple channel struc-ture  was seen at the proximal RCA. Furthermore， the calcified nodules  were seen distal to the struc-ture. There were calcified plaques at the proximal and distal sites. We performed RA using an RA system (Rotalink Plus 1.75 mm， Boston Scientific Corporation， Natic， MA， USA) to ablate the multiple channel structure and calcified nodule after exchanging the guidewire (RotaWire Floppy， Boston Scientific\n\n【26】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2.

Burr speed was selected at 180 000 rpm and there was a drop of 5000 rpm at the multi-ple channel structure and again at the calcified nodule. After the RA passed the lesions， OFDI revealed that the multiple channel structure  and calcified nodule  were ab lated. The total number of ablations was 13， and slow flow or no flow was not observed. Part of the calcified nodule  could not be ablated due to guidewire bias. Especially in the multiple channel structure， the partition walls were ablated and thinned . The lumen area measured by OFDI before and after RA enlarged from 2.4 mm? to 4.8 mm. Then， we per-formed balloon angioplasty using a scoring balloon (NSE Alpha3.0/13 mm， Goodman，Aichi， Japan). The lumen area was en-larged， and we deployed a drug-eluting stent (Resolute Onyx3.5/30 mm， Medtronic Cardiovascular Inc.， Santa Rosa， CA， USA). After post-dilatation， we confirmed good coronary flow and stent expansion by CAG and OFDI .We determined that the PCI was successful in ablating the RCA le-sions. As there are no general recommendations for interven-tion of multiple channel structure， we report this rare treatment of multiple channel structure.\n\n【34】Discussion\n\n【35】The incidence of patients with multiple channel structures in the coronary artery observed by optical coherence tomogra-phy (OCT) has been reported in several studies. Based on histo-logic studies， a multiple channe. structure within the coronary artery is a feature of thrombus recanalization or neovascular-ization.Coronary lesions containing recanalized thrombus are characterized by multiple small channels on OCT， with most showing functional significance. Multiple channel structures have been described as having a “lotus root-like appearance\"，“honeycomb-like appearance”， or“Swiss cheese pattern”通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>. Previous reports indicate that such complex lesions can limit functional coronary flow and can be successfully treated by routine PCI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. According to the literature， most cases of mul-tiple channel structure are functionally significant and require intervention. Favorable outcomes of treatment with drug-elut-ing stents， drug-coated balloons， or bio-resorbable vascular scaffolds have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【36】In the present case， several mechanisms of multiple channel structure formation could be considered. We speculate that this structure might have been due to an organized ruptured plaque，recanalization of a thrombus， or substituted tissue af-ter a spontaneous coronary artery dissection. In addition， OFDI findings suggested calcification on the partition walls. Precise recognition of calcified plaque morphology by OFDI may serve to determine the treatment strategy for patients with athero-sclerotic coronary disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. However， previous reports have not revealed the relationship between RA and calcified nodules.\n\n【37】Regardless of the mechanism， the possibility of distal embo-lism was considered low based on the OFDI findings， and we performed RA for the proximal RCA. Because of the possibility of insufficient stent expansion due to inflexible partition walls， we decided that RA was an appropriate procedure for this le-sion. Consequent to performing the procedure， partition walls of the multiple channel structure were ablated and became thin， allowing good expansion of the drug-eluting stent.\n\n【38】Generally， partition walls can be penetrated using a stan-dard balloon or scoring balloon. We believe that RA will be the optional choice in case of a bifurcation lesion， in which the partition walls cannot be penetrated by a balloon due to the presence of hard tissue. Partition walls of multiple chan-nel structures in a bifurcation lesion should be considered as a risk for side branch occlusion. In some cases， a part of the channel flows into a side branch. In cases where the partition walls on a side branch cannot be cut or a guide wire cannot be inserted into the side branch cavity， the possibility of side branch occlusion is high.\n\n【39】Currently， there are no general recommendations for inter-vention because multiple channel structures are complex and rarely diagnosed. However， there have been several advanc-es in treatment modalities. In instances where lesions prevent wires from passing through， double-lumen catheter and par-allel wire techniques have been useful for entering adjacent cavities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In addition， scoring and cutting balloons might be effective for penetrating partition walls. One case study re-ported treatment of a honeycomb-like structure using a scor-ing balloon and deployment of a drug-eluting stent. However， the structure could not be fenestrated completely even with the buddy wire technique 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. When balloons are not able to penetrate partition walls due to the presence of hard tissue， RA might be an effective treatment option for multiple chan-nel structure lesions.\n\n【40】Conclusions\n\n【41】OFDI demonstrated a multiple channel structure in the proxi-mal RCA. We performed RA and ablated partitions of the mul-tiple channel structure. After this procedure， we acquired good stent expansion at the proximal RCA.\n\n【42】Department and Institution where work was done\n\n【43】Department of Cardiology， Tokyo Metropolitan， Tokyo， Japan\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of interest</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

This study measures the dynamics of Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin serum in malignant subjects treated with chemotherapy. Method： Analytical research with a cohort design. The research subjects were subjects aged >18 years treated with chemotherapy at Dr Wahidin Sudirohusodo Hospital， Makassar， Indonesia. Serum level of Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin measured before and 24 hours after chemotherapy. Results： Post-chemotherapy Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin serum level was significantly higher than pre-chemotherapy(280，330 ng / ml vs. 204，453 ng / ml， p <0，001). The increased percentage of Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin serum level was significantly higher in subjects with a serum creatinine level > 1.3 mg/dl compared to subjects with serum creatinine level <1.3 mg/dl (185% vs 52%， p<0， 05). The increased percentage of Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin serum level was found to be higher in subjects with diabetes and hypertension than those without diabetes and hypertension (160% vs 48%，p<0.05). Discussion： This study found overall increased of Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin serum level in malignant patients 24 hours after chemotherapy，especially in patients with serum creatinine> 1.3 mg/dl and with diabetes and hypertension. A possible explanation is previous kidney injury， hypertension，and diabetes Mellitus makes kidney vulnerable to nephrotoxic substances.\n\n【6】KEYWORDS Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin， acute kidney injury， malignancy， chemotherapy\n\n【7】Copyright @ 2019 by the International Sci Ink Press Ltd\n\n【8】DOI：10.5455/IJMRCR.neutrophil-gelatinase-associated-lipocalin-serum-malignancy\n\n【9】First Received： November 28，2018\n\n【10】Accepted： January 24， 2019\n\n【11】Manuscript Associate Editor： Ivon Ribarova (BG)\n\n【12】1Department of Internal Medicine， Faculty of Medicine； E-mail：dennymmoniaga@yahoo.com\n\n【13】Phone： +6282119750150\n\n【14】Introduction\n\n【15】Acute kidney injury (AKI) in malignant subjects can be caused by the process of the malignancy itself or its therapy in this case， chemotherapy. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> Risk factors for acute kidney injury are older age (> 65 years)， previous chronic kidney disease (CKD)， comorbidity (diabetes mellitus and hypertension)， decreased intravascular volume， type and dose of chemotherapy. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>\n\n【16】Traditionally， the parameters for diagnosing AKI are de-creased urine volume and increased level of serum creatinine(SCr).

Nevertheless， the side effect of chemother-apy including nephrotoxicity is still a problem， because it can reduce the quality of life for the malignant subjects.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> Nephro-toxicity of chemotherapy drugs depends on its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Elderly age， the presence of comorbidi-ties such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension， the presence of CKD， and hypovolemia， are risk factors for AKI in a malignant subject treated with chemotherapy.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> Increased NGAL serum level due to chemotherapy can be caused by several mechanisms such as thrombotic microangiopathy， acute glomerular disease， acute tubular necrosis， crystalline nephropathy， or interstitial nephritis， depending on the chemotherapy drug used.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>\n\n【36】In this study， NGAL serum level after chemotherapy in-creased compared to before chemotherapy. Kos et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> in34 subjects who received chemotherapy with cisplatin found an average NGAL serum level increased after chemotherapy compared to before chemotherapy (139.4 vs 125.5 ng/ml).\n\n【37】In this study， we found a significant increase in post-chemotherapy subjects with sCr> 1.3 mg/dl. Maghsoudi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> compared ten subjects with CKD and five subjects with-out CKD gave cisplatin chemotherapy， found that NGAL serum level and NGAL urine level were higher in subjects with CKD compared with those without CKD (p 0.024； p0.011). Peres et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> measured NGAL serum level in 50 subjects with head and neck malignancies， found that an increase in NGAL serum level was higher in subjects with CKD than without CKD， and although without CKD， NGAL serum level could be detected to increase earlier (3 hours after exposure compared to SCR， which increased after 48-72 hours).\n\n【38】In this study， there was a significant increase in NGAL serum in subjects with comorbid diabetes mellitus and hypertension compared to those without diabetes mellitus and hyperten-sion. In uncontrolled hypertension， increased renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activity results in chronic vasocon-striction of renal afferent arteries， which results in kidney hypop-erfusion， leading to kidney damage.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) formed in subjects with diabetes mellitus can damage podocyte cells， resulting in proteinuria and increased intraglomerular pressure which will cause fibrosis in the kid-ney. Both are risks for the occurrence of AKI even with minimal triggers. Lacquaniti et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> studied the correlation of NGAL with the incidence of diabetic nephropathy. In this study， 56 sub-jects with type 2 diabetes mellitus were collected， then catego-rized into three groups (normoalbuminuria， microalbuminuria and diabetic nephropathy). Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin serum increases in line with the severity of diabetic nephropathy. Hypertension and diabetes mellitus make the kid-ney susceptible to injury because this chronic disease decreases the number of healthy nephrons， which makes even the slightest exposure to the injury can manifest into acute kidney injury.13，14\\]\n\n【39】This study concluded that there was an increase in NGAL serum level in malignant subjects 24-hour after treated with chemotherapy， especially in subjects with level sCr> 1.3 mg/dl and those with diabetes mellitus and hypertension.\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of interest</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The author states that there is no conflict of interest in this study.

Purpose： This sfudy aims to characterize patients with syndromic OFCs that attend the Cleft Lip/Palate multidisciplinary group clinic at Centro Hospitalar Universitario de Sao Joao， Porto-Portugal. Methods： A retrospective analysis of medical records from a cohort of patients observed between January 1992 and December 2018 was performed. The OFCs types were listed according to the Spina classification modified by Silva-Filho et a1. OFCs laterality， family history， associated syndromes and identified gene anomalies were collected. Results： The group included 617 patients， of which 57.3% were males. From the total， 18.6% had a cleft lip， 38.1% had cleft lip and palate， and 42% isolated cleft palate， which was the most frequent. The least frequent was the group of atypical clefts (1.3%). One hundred and fifty-seven patients (25.4%) had a family history of clefting. Syndromes were identified in 149 of the patients： Pierre Robin sequence was the most common (n=48； 32.2%)， followed by 22q11.2 deletion syndrome， Van der Woude， Goldenhar and oral-facial-digital syndrome. Pierre Robin sequence occurred with additional syndromes in 18 cases (12.1%). Discussion： This cohort has 24.1% of an identifiable syndrome， a number higher than described in the literature. The importance of monitoring the OFCs and associated syndromes is a key element not only to tailor the approach and management of the OFCs， the possible complications and to provide accurate and insightful genetic counselling.\n\n【5】KEYWORDS Genetic syndromes， Orofacial clefts， Syndromic Orofacial Clefts\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Orofacial clefts (OFCs) are a common congenital malformation of the lip or palate (hard and/or soft palate) with variable dys-morphological severity due to the complexity of genetic and environmental factors. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>\n\n【8】OFCs are associated with neonatal morbidity and mortality， which may impose a large burden on patients' quality of life and their relatives.

The oldest patient followed-up by this group was born in 1955. According to the Spina classification modified by Silva-Filho et al.，18.6% had CL， 38.1% had CLP 42% isolated CP the most frequent， against the 1.3% AC， the least type.

The knowledge of anomalies associated with OFCs， epidemiology， and dysmorphology will provide nec-essary treatment and follow-ups for these children and future adults. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> Also， the long-term data collected from this group of patients may allow diagnosis in the future， benefitting from the new genetic study techniques， recognising new pathological variants and the importance of the variants， actually classified\n\n【42】as uncertain significance.\n\n【43】A multidisciplinary team is highly recommended in the man-agement of patients with OFC. This team must offer the neces-sary help and care， supporting them to have a better life， with rigorous diagnosis， treatment planning， and adequate proce-dures for OFCs and their anomalies or syndromes， when present.6\n\n【44】It is important that families， since prenatal diagnosis， receive medical information and psychological monitoring to under-stand their baby's congenital disability， anticipate future expec-tations and the range of issues that might arise during the child's life and have genetic counselling information to plan future re-productive options. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>\n\n【45】Besides that， the teams need to report their data to the surveil-lance systems that will allow them to measure prevalence， di-agnostics， treatments，and prognosis by geographic region and worldwide.\n\n【46】In Portugal， there are few studies about the prevalence and surveillance data of OFCs. According to the European Network for the Epidemiological Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies report， OFCs’ prevalence was 13.6 per 10000 live births 通用删除7(英):<u>(1992-2017)</u> in Southern Portugal. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> Other Portuguese OFCs centre reports similar data to the present study. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>\n\n【47】Portugal has few centres to treat OFCs and a homogeneous population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， which can help implement a surveillance system.

Most of the time， extradigital glomus tumors are difficult to diagnose， and symptoms can persist for a long time. The usual clinical presentations consist of pain， tenderness at the site of the tumor， and hypersensitivity to cold.\n\n【22】Case Report： We report a case of a GT of the proximal thigh in a 39-year-old man with left thigh pain without palpable mass for several years， without clear diagnosis. He had pain and hyperesthesia exacerbated by running.

A percutaneous biopsy was done through ultrasound guidance， followed by ex-cisional biopsy and immediate pain relief.\n\n【23】Conclusions： Glomus tumors of the thigh are a rare neoplasm， especially in the proximal thigh； they are difficult to diagnose and are associated with morbidity. Diagnosis can be made through a systematic approach and simple investi-gation， such as via ultrasonography A percutaneous biopsy can help in drawing up a management plan， and malignancy must be considered if the lesion is suspicious. Symptoms can persist in case of incomplete resec-tion or unrecognized synchronous satellite lesions； thus， symptomatic neuroma should be considered.\n\n【24】Keywords： Glomus Tumor · Musculoskeletal System·Surgical Oncology\n\n【25】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/938726\n\n【26】Publisher's note： All daims expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of their affiliated\n\n【27】AP\n\n【28】organizations， or those of the publisher the editors and the reviewers.

Most glomus tumors occur in the hand， especially in the subungual region， as it is rich in blood vessels. Glomus tumors can occur in oth-er regions of the body， and this is considered a very rare sit-uation. The usual clinical presentations consist of pain， ten-derness at the site of the tumor， and hypersensitivity to cold. Most of the time， extradigital glomus tumors are difficult to diagnose， and symptoms can persist for a long time. A few similar cases for glomus tumors around the knee region have been reported with similar presentation. Transformation to a malignant tumor is rare. However， a deeper location and larger size could have a role in this malignant transformation. We re-port a case of an extradigital glomus tumor of the left proximal thigh.

The pain was exacerbated with activity， particularly going up and down stairs， playing football， and running. The pain also became more intense while stretching after waking up. The pain started 3years ago， and had been gradually increasing since that time.

The plain radiographs were unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast was performed and showed a well-defined intramus-cular lesion in the tensor fascia lata， isointense in T1 as well as high signal intensity in T2 via weighted and STIR imaging. It was around 9x9 mm in size . Then， a percutane-ous biopsy was done through ultrasound guidance for diagnos-tic purposes. Ultrasound imaging revealed a round， solid， hy-poechoic， homogeneous mass in the left upper thigh . Histopathology revealed that the tumor cells were round in shape， with indistinct borders and a rounded， sharply punched-out nucleus in the amophilic to eosinophilic cytoplasm. No ev-idence of atypia， necrosis， the spindling of cells or malignancy was seen . Immunohistochemistry showed positivi-ty with vimentin， SMA， muscle-specific actin， and Caldesmon.

A longitudinal skin incision was made along the biopsy entry point. This was fol-lowed by dissection of subcutaneous tissues focused and di-rected toward the biopsy tract until the lesion was identified within the tensor fascia lata . Finally， a marginal ex-cision of the mass was performed. The patient was seen in the clinic 2 weeks later and the symptoms had resolved completely. Informed patient consent was signed for publication purposes.\n\n【40】Discussion\n\n【41】Wood was the first to report glomus tumors， in 1812， de-scribing them as “painful subcutaneous tubercles\"， followed by Masson， who termed them glomus tumors in 1924 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3，7\\]</u>. Glomus tumors are derived from the glomus body， a thermo-regulatory structure that regulates blood circulation to adja-cent skin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The classical triad presentations are pain， ten-derness， and sensitivity to cold.\n\n【42】Generally， the hand is the commonly seen affected site. However， occurrence in the gastrointestinal tract， mediastinum， trachea， mesentery， bone， cervix， and vagina is also possible but less com-mon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Diagnosis is always challenging for physicians， partic-ularly given that the mass is deep and non-palpable， but it can be accurately identified through precise history and clinical ex-amination followed by appropriate investigations. Although a glomus tumor is a benign neoplasm， malignant glomus tumors must be identified if the tumor arises in a deep area and is larg-erthan 2 cm in size 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In our case， the tumor was non-palpable， and imaging revealed that the tumor was deep under the skin and within the tensor fascia lata.

Diagnosis can be made through a systematic approach and simple investigation， such as via ultrasonogra-phy. A percutaneous biopsy can help in drawing up a manage-ment plan， and malignancy must be considered if the lesion is suspicious. Symptoms can persist in case of incomplete re-section or unrecognized synchronous satellite lesions； thus， symptomatic neuroma should be considered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【45】Department and Institution Where Work Was Done\n\n【46】All figures submitted have been created by the authors who confirm that the images are original with no duplication and have not been previously published in whole or in part.\n\n【47】References：\n\n【48】1\\.

The report is of a case of polyarticular amy-loid arthropathy and myopathy in a 56-year-old man with multiple myeloma and includes a description of the radiographic， computed tomography (CT)， and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings.\n\n【25】Case Report：\n\n【26】A 56-year-old man with multiple myeloma presented with chronic polyarticular pain and swelling. Soft tissue thickening of the wrist and knee were found on MRI to be of intermediate T1 weighted imaging (T1Wl) and low to intermediate T2 weighted imaging (T2Wl) signal intensity. Denervation muscle edema seen in the the-nar muscles on the MRI of the right wrist were associated with carpal tunnel syndrome secondary to amyloid deposition. Soft tissue lesions in the periarticular regions of both hip joints were contiguous with subchon-dral bone lesions. Diffusely scattered myeloma lesions were shown as hyperintense on short tau inversion recovery (STIR) MRI imaging throughout the appendicular and axial skeleton， with vertebral compression frac-tures. Bilateral iliopsoas involvement with hypertrophy and abnormal surrounding fat reticulated signal inten-sity was consistent with amyloid myopathy. The patient had a pathological fracture of the right femoral neck and underwent surgical fixation. Histology of the right femoral head confirmed amyloid deposits.\n\n【27】Conclusions：\n\n【28】Because the clinical presentation and imaging findings of musculoskeletal amyloidosis can be nonspecific， they can result in delay in diagnosis and treatment. Early radiologic identification of polyarticular amyloid arthrop-athy and myopathy should prompt confirmatory biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【29】MeSH Keywords： Amyloid·Amyloidosis· Multiple Myeloma\n\n【30】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/911212\n\n【31】Amyloidosis is characterized by the extracellular deposition of amyloid protein and protein derivatives， and can be localized to single organs， or can be systemic. Amyloid proteins pos-sess an affinity for Congo red histochemical staining by light microscopy and demonstrate apple-green birefringence when viewed under polarized light microscopy. The Nomenclature Committee of the International Society of Amyloidosis clas-sifies amyloidosis based on the fibril protein of the amyloid deposit. Primary amyloidosis is caused by the accumulation of monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains (or， more rarely， heavy chains) and is termed amyloid light chain (AL) amyloi-dosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Primary amyloidosis is associated with monoclonal plasma cell dyscrasias， including multiple myeloma. Secondary amyloidosis is characterized by the accumulation of the acute phase protein serum amyloid A (SAA)， and is associated with chronic inflammatory conditions， including Reiter's syndrome， ankylosing spondylitis， Crohn’s disease， and rheumatoid ar-thritis， chronic infection， including tuberculosis and chronic osteomyelitis， and malignant disease， including renal cell car-cinoma， and Hodgkin's disease 1-3\\]. Amyloidosis due to the accumulation of beta-2 microglobulin occurs in patients with chronic renal failure on long-term hemodialysis.\n\n【32】Amyloid deposition may occur in various organs， including the gastrointestinal tract， heart， lungs， and skin. Involvement of the musculoskeletal system is not uncommon although these patients are rarely symptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. There are varied and non-specific imaging findings in amyloid arthropathy and myopathy， which may present a diagnostic challenge to radiologists.

The diagnosis was confirmed with bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy and histology. The patient was subsequently commenced on chemotherapy. He gave a history of long-standing polyarticular pain and swelling， involving the shoulders， wrists， hips， and knees. There was no history of trauma. The patient underwent left hemicolectomy for a stage T1 N1 MO descending colon tumor a year previously. Other significant co-morbidities included chronic kidney dis-ease， rheumatic heart disease， and hypertension.\n\n【35】The patient's vital signs were stable.

Amyloid arthropathy is more commonly seen in older patients， which can distinguish it from rheumatoid arthritis.

Periarticular soft tis-sue masses correlating with nodular synovial hypertrophy are often seen， and amyloidosis with bony involvement demon-strate lytic lucency within the cortical or medullary bone， usually with fine sclerotic margins， often located in the periarticular bone and at the site of ligamentous insertions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Bony me-tastases and deposits of multiple myeloma are other differen-tial diagnoses， although these do not show a periarticular pre-dilection.

Periarticular erosions as-sociated with diffuse nodular synovial thickening with low to intermediate T1 weighted imaging (T1Wl) and T2 weighted imaging (T2WI) signals on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may suggest a diagnosis of amyloid arthropathy in the right clinical setting. Amyloid myopathy is associated with muscle hypertrophy with subcutaneous fat reticulation on fluid-sen-sitive MRI sequences， which is often associated clinically with induration of the extremities. Early radiologic identification of polyarticular amyloid arthropathy and myopathy should prompt a confirmatory biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【58】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of interest</u>\n\n【59】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

This acute illness is caused by a novel Coronavirus first identified in Wuhan， China， with a zoonotic origin， which has spread internationally from person-to-person through travelling to nearly 213 countries. No specific vaccines and treatments have been yet approved， and therefore presently the best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus and to strictly comply with the restrictions on travel， movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with these disease control efforts will reduce the risk of catching or spreading the virus. Measures to prevent transmission should be implemented in populations at risk， contacts as well as health care providers. Those practising social distancing or under quarantine may feel lonely and depressed should keep themselves occupied with a hobby， doing something constructive and adopting an attitude of learning something new daily. People should monitor themselves and remain alert for relevant symptoms. Health care facilities should be equipped with triage and isolation facilities and workers should be trained for management of patients. WHO has focused on contact tracing，rapid testing and identification for Coronavirus. Proper information should be communicated regularly to reduce assumptions regarding the disease in public. As containment of COVID 19 pandemic is extraordinarily difficult， this article is an attempt to emphasize the importance of social responsibility of individuals and government which can together play a significant role to act in the best interests of the environment， health and society as a whole.\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】As on April 13， 2020， the World Health Organization (WHO) reports around 1.77 million confirmed cases， 1， 11， 000 deaths and 211 countries affected by the current Coronavirus Disease(COVID 19) pandemic causing huge negative social and eco-nomic impact 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【6】This acute illness caused by a novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 virus was first identified in Wuhan， China， with a zoonotic\n\n【7】Copyright @ 2020 by the Bulgarian Association of Young Surgeons\n\n【8】DOI：10.5455/IJMRCR.NOVEL-CORONAVIRUS-PANDEMIC\n\n【9】First Received： April 15， 2020Accepted： May 14，2020Associate Editor： Ivan Inkov (BG)；\n\n【10】Professor Dr. Syed Esam Mahmood， Department of Family and Community Medicine，\n\n【11】King Khalid University， Abha， KSA； Email： semahmood@gmail.com，\n\n【12】smahmood@kku.edu.sa； Mobile： +966-550484344\n\n【13】origin， which has spread from person-to-person internationally through travelling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Patient of any age may develop mild to severe respiratory illness， and those having chronic diseases are more susceptible.\n\n【14】The virus is transmitted from an infected person through respiratory droplets produced while coughing or sneezing to an-other person who comes in close contact. Transmission through fomites like a thermometer， stethoscope， metal coins， clothes， plastics and steel is also possible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The zoonotic origin may be possible as the virus was identified in the environmental samples from a live animal market in Wuhan， and some human cases were epidemiologically linked 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Challenges\n\n【16】No specific vaccine and treatment have been yet approved. Few candidate vaccines are under development and will en-ter human trials in future. Drugs like Hydroxychloroquine and\n\n【17】Lopinavir/Ritonavir used need more supportive high-quality researches 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Scaling-up of research and development of thera-peutics， vaccines and diagnostics is an essential pillar for 2019-nCoV Strategic preparedness and response plan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The bot-tleneck to contain COVID-19 globally has been the shortage of laboratory supplies and protective equipment needed to support the health workers on the frontlines of the response.\n\n【18】Global concern\n\n【19】COVID-19 has raised many global concerns and actions. WHO strategic preparedness and response plan outlines the available public health measures to be provided to support countries to prepare for and respond to COVID-19. WHO has also released guidelines to maintain essential health services during the pan-demic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【20】The first 425 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infected pneu-monia reported in Wuhan in December 2019 and January 2020were analyzed. Based on the observations， the mean incuba-tion period was 5.2 days (95% CI， 4.1 to 7.0)， and the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days in its early stages. It also became evident that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts and measures to prevent transmission should be implemented in populations at risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【21】The Australian Modeling projects that if less than 70 percent of the population adopts social distancing measures， then the control shall be difficult and it could go into vain. However， if nearly 90% population follows social distancing， then control can be achieved in about three months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Social distancing causes less exposure to cases and can buy time； during this period， contacts are to be searched， identified and treated. China has been successful in controlling the COVID-19 epidemic through measures like social distancing， quarantine and isolation of infected populations. This is encouraging for the countries where COVID-19 is beginning to spread. However， the potential economic impact of self-isolation or mandated quarantine could be substantial， as occurred in China 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Preventive measures\n\n【24】The best way to prevent illness presently is to avoid close contact and to strictly comply with the restrictions on travel， movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with these disease control efforts will reduce the risk of catching or spreading the virus. Quarantine of populations and the suspension of transport links at local and international levels are needed. Frequent， thorough hand-washing and good respiratory hygiene are to be practised. Good respiratory hygiene means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze fol-lowed by proper disposal of the used tissue immediately.\n\n【25】Close contact is being within 2 meters of a COVID-19 case for a prolonged period. This can occur while caring for， living with， visiting， or sharing a healthcare waiting area or room with a COVID-19 case or having direct contact with infectious secretions of a COVID-19 case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Social or physical distancing prevents people from interact-ing closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious dis-ease. People are encouraged to stay home while schools and public places like malls and movie theatres close， and sports events， conferences and religious services are cancelled. Online classes and meetings via video conferencing or phone calls are held from home. One can interact with family and friends us-ing phone， video chats and email 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Maintaining a healthy\n\n【27】lifestyle through proper diet， sleep and exercise are necessary. Frequent disinfection of all household surfaces such as tables， washbasins and doorknobs along with increased indoor ven-tilation by opening windows or adjust the air conditioning， is recommended.\n\n【28】Those practising social distancing or under quarantine may find the situation hard to defeat the infection. Loneliness may lead to higher levels of the hormone cortisol， indicating stress； weaker immune responses to pathogens； and increased risk for premature death. Isolation can lead to depression and suicidal thoughts. One should refrain from smoking， alcohol intake， and drug abuse to deal with such emotions. Smoking increases the chances of virus transmission from fingers to mouth. Keeping self-occupied with a hobby， doing something constructive and adopting an attitude of learning something new daily can do wonders.\n\n【29】Anyone visiting or working in animal markets should prac-tice general hygiene measures， and avoid contact with sick ani-mals， spoiled animal products and stray animals. The consump-tion of raw or undercooked animal products should be avoided. Self-monitoring by recording temperature twice daily and re-maining alert for cough and shortness of breath is required. If relevant symptoms develop during this period， one should self-isolate， limit contact with others， and seek advice for further medical evaluation by telephone from a healthcare provider or the local health department.\n\n【30】Fake news spreads largely via social media sites， in particular， Facebook， youtube and twitter. The sharing of and believing in false or misleading information is strongly discouraged. Some social media platforms have started providing more information about the source of news and articles. However， fact-checking necessarily takes more time and effort， and the social media ru-mours may mislead， hype the panic and affect the health-seeking behaviours of communities. Indeed， correcting misinformation and replacing it with the accurate one can diminish the contin-ued influence of misinformation.\n\n【31】Conclusion\n\n【32】Health care facilities should be equipped with triage and iso-lation facilities， and workers should be trained for supportive treatment and emergency management of patients. Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk， contacts and health care providers. Contact tracing teams should spring into action in current situation and find people who may have been in contact with and infected by the person confirmed to have the disease. WHO has focused on rapid testing for the novel coronavirus to track the disease spread. Individuals with mild to moderate symptoms should undergo self-isolation and care， while those with severe symp-toms require hospitalization and inpatient treatment. People who are at risk should be given instructions about what they need to do. Health care workers should use Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) like gowns， gloves and eye protection to lower the risk of exposure to infection. Proper information should be communicated regularly to reduce assumptions regarding the disease in public. Social responsibility of individuals plays a significant role to act in the best interests of their environment， health and society as a whole. \n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of interest</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Author declare no conflict of interests.

It is usually the re-sult of a combined glomerular and tubular dysfunction and is associated with a poor prognosis. No guidelines exist for treatment.\n\n【17】Case Report： We herein describe the case of a 78-year-old Caucasian man who presented with acute myeloid leukemia M5， leukostasis with a white count of 340 000/ml， and acute renal failure with a creatinine of 7.7/dL. The patient was initially treated with leukapheresis and 3 days of idarubicin in the setting of continuous renal replacement therapy that resulted in rapid reversal of his renal failure. He then received 7 days of continuous infusion cy-tarabine and went into a complete remission.\n\n【18】Conclusions：\n\n【19】Renal failure may complicate the presentation of AML but can be reversible with treatment. Dose adjustment of the chemotherapy is not needed and the treatment can be greatly facilitated with the use of continuous renal replacement therapy as indicated in our case report. In addition， we emphasize that organ dysfunction， even in elderly patients， is not necessarily a contraindication to aggressive treatment if it is felt to be disease-related and reversible.\n\n【20】MeSH Keywords： Acute Kidney Injury· Cytarabine· Hemofiltration · Idarubicin· Leukemia， Myeloid， Acute·Leukostasis\n\n【21】Full-text PDF http：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/890798\n\n【22】口1631\n\n【23】l Department of Internal Medicine， BethIsrael Deaconess Medical Center Boston MA， U.S.A.\n\n【24】2 Department of Hematology and Oncology， Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Boston， MA， U.S.A.\n\n【25】3 Department of Hematology and Oncology Cedars-Sinai Medical Center， Los\n\n【26】Leukostasis， acute renal failure， and extramedullary tissue in filtration are more likely to be present at diagnosis in patients with acute myelomonocytic and monocytic leukemias (M4 and M5) than in other subtypes of AML通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u> and have been asso-ciated with poor prognosis and death within the first week of presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The combination of acute renal failure， pro-teinuria，hypokalemia， and hypophosphatemia specifically ap-pears to be characteristic for patients with AML M4 and M5because it is not found in other subtypes and is the result of a combined glomerular and tubular dysfunction.\n\n【27】Although this is a relatively common presentation， there is no good data to guide initial treatment decisions in patients with AML and acute renal failure. In our review of the literature we identified 1 case report describing reversibility of renal fail-ure and tubule dysfunction with chemotherapy treatment in a patient with AML M5 who presented with leukostasis and did not require renal replacement therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In another case of a pediatric patient presenting with AML M4 and renal fail-ure， radiation therapy to the kidneys was attempted and ap-parently failed， and then dose-reduced chemotherapy in the setting of hemodialysis reversed the renal failure and induced remission of the leukemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【28】We report a case of a patient presenting with AML M5， leu-kostasis， acute renal failure， and hypophosphatemia. To our knowledge this is the first case describing complete revers-ibility of the renal failure and tubule dysfunction after treat-ment of the underlying leukemia with full-dose chemothera-py and in the setting of continuous renal replacement therapy.\n\n【29】Case Report\n\n【30】A 78-year-old Caucasian man with atrial fibrillation， hyperten-sion， and dyslipidemia presented to our service with 2 days of oliguria after a week of fevers， dyspnea， fatigue， and sore throat. Initial laboratory evaluation revealed abnormal blood counts： 340x10// white blood cells (98% blasts)，59x10/l plate-lets， and a 26.9% hematocrit. Serum chemistries were signifi-cant for the following values (in mg/dL unless otherwise not-ed， abnormal values are in bold)： sodium 140， potassium 4.0， chloride 101， bicarbonate 24， blood urea nitrogen 49， creat-inine 7.7， uric acid 16.2， calcium 11.6(11.9 corrected)， phos-phate 0.9， magnesium 2.4， and lactate dehydrogenase 1329IU/L. His urinalysis showed many cellular casts consisting of white cells that had the appearance of blasts.\n\n【31】Chest x-ray showed bilateral infiltrates suggesting leukemic infiltration or infection. A bilateral renal ultrasound showed normal-sized kidneys and no hydronephrosis.\n\n【32】A bone marrow biopsy was performed，showing that 99% of the aspirate cellularity consisted of large cells with large nu-clei， with irregular nuclear containing an open chromatin， prominent nucleoli， moderate nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio； ba-sophilic cytoplasm and occasional cytoplasm vacuoles， con-sistent with blasts. The marrow was packed， with overall cel-lularity approaching 100%. There was an interstitial infiltrate of immature cells consistent with blasts occurring in sheets occupying 99% of marrow cellularity. Cell marker analysis demonstrated that the majority of the cells isolated from the peripheral blood/bone marrow expressed immature an-tigens CD34， HLA-DR， myeloid associated antigens CD117， CD13 (dim)， CD15 (variable)， CD11c， CD64 (subset)，and CD71， whereas lymphoid-associated antigen CD7 and were negative for CD10 (cALLa)， B-cell antigens， other T-cell antigens CD2， CD3， CD5， CD4，CD8， as well as CD33， CD14， CD41， CD56， and Glycophorin A. Overall picture was consistent with AML， FAB subtype M5 without chromosomal abnormalities. FLT3 and NMP1 mutations were negative.\n\n【33】The gravity of his diagnosis was conveyed to the patient and palliative care was offered. The patient， highly functional and still productive in the community， opted for aggressive treat-ment and was admitted to the intensive care unit. He was started on aggressive intravenous hydration (initially 250 ml/hr and then 125 ml/hr of D5W with 150 mEg/L of sodium bicar-bonate)， antibiotics (cefepime)， and hydroxyurea at 1000 mg twice a day. He received rasburicase and underwent 3 ses-sions of leukapheresis. Continuous venovenous hemofiltra-tion with dialysis (CVVHD) was initiated. He was then start-ed on induction therapy with idarubicin at 9 mg/m2 on day 1and 12 mg/m2 on days 2 and 3. By day 4， his white cell count had returned to normal levels， his creatinine had improved to1.3 mg/dL and uric acid to 5.9 mg/dL， and CVVHD was dis continued. On Day 5 he was started on 7 days of cytarabine at 100 mg/m2/day as a continuous infusion. His day 14 bone marrow was ablated， his peripheral counts recovered by day28， and his day 28 marrow showed normal hematopiesis with-out an excess of blasts. His hospital course was complicated by enterococcal bacteremia，candidemia， pulmonary aspergil-losis， and a gastrointestinal bleed， but he recovered and was discharged to home on day 44.\n\n【34】He then underwent consolidation chemotherapy with 6 cycles of low-dose idarubicin and cytarabine. He relapsed 14 months after the time of first remission. He was subsequently rein-duced with clofarabine and cytarabine and went into a second remission. He underwent further consolidation with clofara-bine and cytarabine but relapsed 6 months later. He was re-treated with decitabine but developed a viral gastrointestinal infection that resulted in acute tubular necrosis requiring he-modialysis. Thereafter， he chose palliative care and died 22.5months after his original presentation.\n\n【35】Renal dysfunction and failure is a common presenting sign in patients with acute myelocytic and monocytic leukemia. The etiology of renal failure in patients with AML M4 and M5is multifactorial and the result is a combined glomerular and tubular dysfunction， which is a unique manifestation com-pared to the other types of leukemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. Older studies sug-gested that eventually all patients with M4 and M5 develop proteinuria and about 50% of them develop “azotemia”通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. A main cause for glomerular dysfunction is direct infiltration of the kidneys by blasts. Enlarged kidneys are a sign of leu-kemic infiltration but patients may also have microscopic in-filtration as indicated by autopsy series in which leukemic in-filtration of the kidneys was found in almost all patients with M4 and M5 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>.\n\n【36】In addition， patients with AML M4 and M5 have a high se-rum and urine level of lysozyme， thought to originate from the blast cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Lysozyme directly damages tubule cells， leading to proximal tubular acidosis similar to Fanconi's syn-drome and patients present with proteinuria and with hypo-kalemia and hypophosphatemia despite sometimes having a very high cellular turnover and/or renal failure. (“lysozyme kid-ney\") 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7，11\\]</u>. In addition patients with myelocytic and mono-cytic leukemia may have hypergammaglobulinemia (in contrast to the hypogammaglobulinemia seen in the other subtypes of AML)， which has also been implicated as a contributing factor to tubular dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【37】Spontaneous tumor lysis has in rare cases been described in patients with acute leukemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，13\\]</u> and can also lead to acute renal failure at presentation， but the characteristic electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia) associ-ated with the \"lysozyme kidney\" can help distinguish between the 2 syndromes. Another mechanism that can explain renal failure at presentation is leukemic thrombi in the renal vas-culature， but this seems to be rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【38】In our patient， the cause of renal failure was most likely mul-tifactorial. He had renal infiltration， as evidenced by the pres-ence of leukemic blast casts， but also had tubular dysfunction with hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia. We did not pursue a kidney biopsy because it would be a significant risk and un-likely to alter management. Instead we used rasburicase to control his uric acid level and initiated CVVHD. Continuous ve-novenous hemofiltration (CVVH) has been used successfully in patients with Burkitt's lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia both to prevent and treat tumor lysis syndrome and to allow for the safe administration of chemotherapy in the setting of renal insufficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15-17\\]</u>. In theory the slow， con-tinuous removal of metabolites achieved by CVH should be\n\n【39】physiologically superior and better tolerated compared to the intermittent forms of dialysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. If the hemofiltration provid-ed by CWH is not sufficient to remove the metabolites， then continuous dialysis can easily be started in the form of CVVH with dialysis (CVHD).\n\n【40】We decided to treat his underlying leukemia with idarubicin first (slightly dose-reduced only on day 1) because it is hepat-ically cleared and can be safely administered. The dose ad-justment for continuous infusion cytarabine in patients with renal failure has not been established but there is a concern for accumulation of its toxic metabolite Ara-U 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19，20\\]</u>. In ad-dition， cytarabine is a dialyzable small molecule (243.22 ki-lodaltons - KD) that can be easily removed by CVH， sharp-ly limiting its efficacy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Idarubicin， on the other hand， is a large (533.96 KD)， non-dialyzable molecule 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Lysozyme is also a small molecule (15 KD) and it is likely that CVVH con-tributed to the rapid reversal of our patient's renal failure by quickly lowering his lysozyme levels. In addition， a sharp de-cline in the number of lysozyme-producing leukemic cells was achieved with leukapheresis， hydroxyurea， and idarubicin. The end result was a rapid reversal of his renal failure and tubular dysfunction， indicating that the damage induced by leukemic infiltration and lysozyme can be temporary. The return of his renal function to normal allowed us to safely administer the cytarabine after the completion of idarubicin. Administering cytarabine out of sequence did not appear to negatively affect the day 14 or 28 marrow results or overall outcome.\n\n【41】Conclusions\n\n【42】Renal failure due to combined glomerular and tubular dysfunc-tion may complicate the presentation of acute myelocytic and monocytic leukemia but can be rapidly reversible with treat-ment. Dose adjustment of the chemotherapy is not needed and the treatment can be greatly facilitated with the use of contin-uous rena. replacement therapy， as indicated in our case re-port. Because anthracyclines are not renally cleared， they can be administered first， and cytarabine administration can be-gin after the reversal of kidney dysfunction and discontinua-tion of continuous renal replacement therapy. We emphasize that organ dysfunction，even in elderly patients， is not neces-sarily a contraindication to aggressive treatment if it is felt to be disease-related and reversible.\n\n【43】Statement\n\n【44】The authors did not receive any funding or support for this case report.\n\n【45】1\\.

We present a case of life-threatening bleeding caused by AHA， following trauma and complicated by multiple venous thrombi.\n\n【26】Case Report：\n\n【27】A 21-year-old man presented with multiple injuries secondary to trauma leading to extensive life-saving sur-gery. Two weeks post-operatively， he developed multiple deep venous thrombi and was started on anticoag-ulation. Twenty-four days post-operatively， he started bleeding from multiple mucosal sites and developed an abdominal hematoma. Anticoagulation was stopped， with administration of fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K. Diagnosis of AHA was made based on low factor VIll level and presence of factor VIII inhibitors after an ap-propriate battery of tests ruled out other possible diagnoses. He was started on steroids and recombinant fac-tor Vlla， leading to immediate improvement.Once stable， Rituximab infusions resulted in decreasing factor VIII inhibitor levels， with gradual normalization of PTT.\n\n【28】Conclusions：\n\n【29】AHA remains a diagnostic challenge because of its rarity leading to delay in diagnosis and causing significant morbidity and mortality. Elevated PTT relative to PT/INR is a strong clue which should be followed by mixing studies. Very few cases have been associated with surgery or trauma and relatively few arge， controlled trials have compared different treatment modalities for AHA. Growing evidence supports anti-CD20 (Rituximab) as an effective treatment option， as in this case.\n\n【30】MeSH Keywords： Factor Vlla · Hemophilia A· Venous Thrombosis\n\n【31】Full-text PDF http：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/895316\n\n【32】1635 H山白1 38\n\n【33】Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is estimated to occur in 1-4 peo-ple per million. Due to its low incidence， a potentially high mor-tality rate， and the high prevalence of anticoagulation in pa-tients today， AHA presents a diagnostic challenge.\n\n【34】AHA has a bi-modal peak， displaying prevalence in women ages 20-30 as a complication of pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>， and equally in men and women ages 60-67 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-4\\]</u>. In general， about 50%of all cases are associated with either peri/post-partum sta-tus， or rheumatological conditions. The other 50% of cases are idiopathic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，5-7\\]</u>. Post-partum hemophilia usually has a good prognosis， with favorable outcomes in up to 97% of cas-es 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u> compared to post-operative bleeding in known AHA cases， which carries a 22% risk of fatality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>，\n\n【35】Of the rheumatologic conditions， acquired factor defi-ciency is most highly associated with rheumatoid arthri-tis and SLE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10-12\\]</u>， accounting for about 18% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Associations have also been reported with solid tumors and certain drugs， including Penicillin， Ampicillin， TMP/SMX， Clopidogrel， and Phenytoin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. We present a case of life-threatening bleeding caused by acquired factor VIII deficien-cy， occurring 24 days post-op， and complicated by multiple ve-nous thrombi. While only a handful of cases have associated surgery with AHA， our case directly implicates trauma and/or surgery as a primary culprit， and was successfully treated\n\n【36】with Rituximab. Furthermore， as most reports cite AHA devel-oping peri-operatively， this case may be novel as it presented24 days following trauma and reparative surgery.\n\n【37】Case Report\n\n【38】A 21-year-old African-American man with no significant med-ical history presented with multiple abdominal organ injuries secondary to multiple gunshot wounds (GSWs). The coagula-tion panel was within normal limits upon admission. He im-mediately underwent an exploratory laparotomy with repair of the abdominal wall， colonic resection， splenectomy， and gastric repair.\n\n【39】At 14 days post-op， the patient developed right femoral vein and bilateral cephalic vein thrombi despite being on prophylac-tic doses of enoxaparin to prevent such thrombi. A therapeutic dose of enoxaparin was started， bridging him to warfarin until a therapeutic INR was achieved. At 24 days post-surgery， the patient started bleeding from multiple mucosal sites，including the Gl tract， and internally， resulting in an abdominal hema-toma . Continued massive bleeding caused he-modynamic instability， and warfarin was stopped， while mul-tiple units of erythrocytes， fresh frozen plasma， and vitamin K were transfused.\n\n【40】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1. (A) Showing transverse section and (B) showing coronal section of the abdomen with red arrows indicating a large abdominal wall hematoma displacing the intra-abdominal structures.</u>\n\n【41】The bleeding failed to improve， requiring routine infusions of blood products. Coagulation studies showed an elevated par-tial thromboplastin time (PTT) >100， with near-normal PT 通用删除7(英):<u>(16)</u>. Further hematological workup revealed the absence of lupus anticoagulant， ruling out SLE. A mixing study showed minimal correction of PTT， indicating the presence of a coagulation fac-tor inhibitor. Follow-up tests found factor VIII to be less than1% (normal range： 80-150% of expected). A Bethesda Assay quantified the strength of the Factor VIII inhibitor to be 12Bethesda units (BUs)， normal range：0-0.4.\n\n【42】The patient was started on methylprednisolone 40 mg Vq8h and recombinant factor Vlla， thereby bypassing any factor deficiencies， activating the clotting cascade， and leading to im-mediate improvement. Once stable， Rituximab infusions were started. Infusions were calculated from a dose of 375 mg/m?， resulting in an 825 mg infusion with normal saline，beginning at 50 mg/h and titrating up to a maximum rate of 400 mg/h until complete. Infusions were continued once weekly for 4weeks with a plan to continue unti! levels normalized. A re-peat Bethesda assay done 3 weeks later showed factor inhib-itor strength of 5.2 BUs (down from 12)， indicating success-ful treatment response.\n\n【43】Discussion\n\n【44】Clinical presentation\n\n【45】In terms of clinical presentation，hemarthrosis is the hallmark of congenital hemophilia， but it is rare in the acquired form. Patients with acquired hemophilia present more commonly with purpura， Gl bleeds， and soft tissue and sub-cutaneous bleeding， with large hematomas and hematuria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. While many patients live with congenital hemophilia A， acquired factor VII deficiency often results in severe， life-threatening bleeding， with mortality rates as high as 8-22%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，15\\]</u>.\n\n【46】Diagnosis\n\n【47】While many conditions can elevate both PT and PTT， the hall-mark of acquired factor VIII deficiency is a prolonged PTT. The differential diagnosis for prolonged PTT includes both congen-ital and acquired factor deficiencies， specifically factor ⅧIII(he-mophilia A)， IX (hemophilia B)， and von Willebrand disease， as well as the development of lupus anticoagulant， medication side-effects， and heparin contamination.\n\n【48】The initial work-up for prolonged PTT is to re-draw the coagu-lation panel， eliminating heparin contamination as a possible contaminant. Once eliminated， a medication history should be taken to rule-out iatrogenic causes. The next step is to order a mixing study， allowing the physician to differentiate between\n\n【49】the presence of an inhibitor such as the lupus anticoagulant， versus a factor deficiency such as congenital hemophilia or von Willebrand disease. If the coagulopathy was caused by a deficiency， the addition of normal blood will correct the PTT. If the PTT remains prolonged， the coagulopathy is being caused by an inhibitor， which will persist when mixed with the nor-mal blood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Follow-up testing can then be done to deter-mine presence/absence of lupus anticoagulants， which factor is defective， and the strength of an inhibitor/autoantibody us-ing a Bethesda assay.\n\n【50】Treatment\n\n【51】The following treatment recommendations are derived from literature searches and divided into management based on the presence or absence of active bleeding.\n\n【52】In the presence ofactive bleeding\n\n【53】In the setting of hemodynamic instability with active uncon-trolled bleeds， the first-line treatment is to bypass the defi-ciency altogether， and activate the clotting cascade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17-19\\]</u>. Activated prothrombin complex concentrates (aPCCs)， such as recombinant factor Vlla (used here) or FEIBA (factor VIII inhib-itor bypass agent)， have been shown effective in controlling over 80% of acute bleeds 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【54】Active bleeding in hemodynamically stable patients may be treated with desmopressin (DDAVP) at a dose of 0.3 mcg/kg/day subcutaneously for up to 5 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，21，22\\]</u> as a means to acti-vate the remaining quantities of factor VIII. Note that DDAVP is contraindicated in hemodynamically unstable patients be cause it is thought to hyperactivate autoantibodies. Alternative treatments include concentrated or porcine factor VIII adminis tered as a bolus until the desired response is achieved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，23，24\\]</u>. IIG has also shown limited， but potential， efficacy as an al-ternative for treatment refractory bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16，25\\]</u>. If avail-able， plasmapheresis with immunoabsorption is a fast-act-ing alternative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【55】In the absence ofactive bteeding\n\n【56】Once bleeding has stopped， the deranged cell line origi-nating antibodies to factor VIII must be suppressed. The mainstay of this treatment is prednisone 1 mg/kg/day for 3weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，27，28\\]</u>. For second-line treatments， either cyclo-phosphamide 1 mg/kg/day or a combination of cyclophospha-mide and prednisone for another 3 weeks has shown a 50%success rate in refractory cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. New alternative second-line treatments include rituximab， which was used with this case. Rituximab， when administered once per week at a dose of 375 mg/m² has shown tremendous efficacy in early trials， successfully treating 80% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29，30\\]</u>.\n\n【57】It should be noted that while the above treatments are com-mon， there is a paucity of research comparing the efficacy of different immunosuppressive regimens. Current guidelines are based upon literature reviews and clinical judgement， and not on large randomized trials 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>.\n\n【58】Post-operative/traumatic etiology of acquired factor VIII deficiency\n\n【59】There has been substantial research documenting the dan-gers of surgery in patients with undiagnosed， pre-existing ac-quired hemophilia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. Analyzing 15 case studies， Brack et al.通用删除7(英):<u>(2009)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u> emphasized the importance of following up irreg-ular coagulation panels and asking patients， even for minor surgeries， about any histories of abnormal bleeding.\n\n【60】However， documentation of trauma or surgery as eti-ologies themselves is rare. Alumkal et al. 通用删除7(英):<u>(1999)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u> and Theodossaides et al. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2001)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u> both published cases of pa-tients with no previous histories developing acquired he-mophilia immediately following surgery. Green and Lechner通用删除7(英):<u>(1981)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u> also found an association with trauma and/or sur-gery after reviewing 215 patients.\n\n【61】While both surgery and trauma have been sparingly document-ed as potential etiologies for acquired hemophilia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33-36\\]</u>，the burden and incidence of this severe complication remains un-clear. Furthermore， as our patient suffered multiple abdomi-nal organ injuries from GSWs， and as his surgery was equal-ly involved， it seems evident that the trauma， the surgery， or both could have caused his AHA.\n\n【62】Of note， while previous cases have shown acquired hemophilia developing immediately following surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33，34\\]</u>， our patient did not develop AHA until 24 days post-op. This lag seems to indicate the development of lgG autoantibodies. While IgM is produced rapidly after antigen exposure， substantial levels\n\n【63】References：\n\n【64】1\\.

This late peak and presentation loosely corresponds with our case’s timetable， and therefore extends the window period for life-threatening complications from days to weeks.\n\n【75】Conclusions\n\n【76】Because of its extreme rarity and a varied presentation， ac-quired hemophilia remains a diagnostic menace for post-op-erative bleeding， resulting in high mortality rates. While an isolated peak in PTT may be classic， a relative increase in PTT must also raise suspicion. Regardless of medical history， ac-quired hemophilia must be considered in cases of post-oper-ative bleeding. The link between trauma/surgery and acquired hemophilia must be illuminated if the mortality rate is to be controlled. This case adds to the small but growing body of work indicating trauma and/or surgery as etiologies， impli-cates lgG as a culprit， and highlights the need to expand the window of risk to 3-4 weeks post-op.\n\n【77】In the absence of treatment guidelines， current recommenda-tions are based mostly on literature reviews and clinical judg-ment. Acutely， restoring the coagulation pathway through aPCCs is paramount. Long-term treatment must suppress the cell lines producing the auto-antibodies. There is growing ev-idence for the use of rituximab， although further research is needed to determine its indications and contraindications. Increased research and awareness are needed to address AHA as a predictable and late complication of surgery/trauma，as it persists as an often fatal diagnostic dilemma.\n\n【78】Financial disclosure\n\n【79】No affiliation， no grants received.\n\n【80】9\\.

However， it is often difficult to avoid all these risks in the perioperative period of open heart surgery. Herein， we report hypokalemia-induced cardiac arrest in a postoperative cardiac patient with LQT1 on catecholamine.\n\n【26】Case Report：\n\n【27】A 79-year-old woman underwent surgical aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis. Although the ini-tial plan was not to use catecholamine， catecholamine was used in the Postoperative Intensive Care Unit with attention to QT interval and electrolytes due to heart failure caused by postoperative bleeding. Serum potas-sium levels were controlled above 4.5 mEq/l， and no arrhythmic events occurred. On postoperative day 4， the patient was started on insulin owing to hyperglycemia. Cardiac arrest occurred after the first insulin dose； the implantable cardioverter defibrillator was activated， and the patient's own heartbeat resumed. Subsequent ex-amination revealed that a marked decrease in serum potassium level had occurred after ins ulin administration. The electrocardiogram showed obvious QT prolongation and ventricular fibrillation following R on T. Thereafter， under strict potassium management， there was no recurrence of cardiac arrest events.\n\n【28】Conclusions：\n\n【29】A patient with LQT1 who underwent open heart surgery developed ventricular fibrillation after Torsades de Pointes， probably due to hypokalemia after insulin administration in addition to catecholamine. It is important to check serum potassium levels to avoid the onset of Torsades de Pointes in patients with long QT syndrome. In addition， the impact of insulin administration was reaffirmed.\n\n【30】Keywords： Arrhythmias， Cardiac ·Catecholamines· Death， Sudden， Cardiac ·Diabetes Mellitus\n\n【31】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/938609\n\n【32】日1 十1678 二 1 HLLn2 目国10\n\n【33】Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is one of the genetic dis orders characterized by prolonged QT interval on electrocar-diogram (ECG)， lethal arrhythmias such as Torsades de Pointes(TdP)， ventricular fibrillation (VF)， and a high possibility of sud-den cardiac death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

She had had 2 episodes of ICD actua-tion in the 3 months before admission. LQT1 syndrome with KCNQ1 gene mutation had been diagnosed. Her ECG showed remarkable QTc interval prolongation (Bazett formula，644 ms) and left ventricular hypertrophy (SV+RV， >35 mm， strain pat-tern on V) . Echocardiography revealed a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 0.65 (Teichholz method)， Dd/Ds of43/28， left ventricular posterior wall thickness of 12 mm，aor-tic valve area of 0.7 cm² (equation of continuity)， and peak ve-locity of 4.1 m/s.

To maintain the patient's BP， 0.25 to 0.4 pg/kg/min of phen-ylephrine was administered. A pulmonary artery catheter and a transesophageal echocardiograph probe were placed. An in-flow duct for the cardiopulmonary bypass was placed in the ascending aorta， and an outflow duct (2-stage) was inserted into the right atrium. After the surgery， she was weaned from the cardiopulmonary bypass without problems. After cardio-pulmonary bypass， her hemodynamics，including BP， heart rate， and cardiac index (CI)， were stable， without catecholamines. However， phenylephrine was administered to raise her BP. The operation time was 5 h and 23 min，anesthesia time was7 h and 10 min， and cardiopulmonary bypass duration was 2h and 34 min. The patient's serum potassium ion level was kept in the range of 4.5 to 5.0 mEq/L，serum glucose level un-der 200 mg/dl， and serum calcium level in the normal range.\n\n【41】In the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)， she was maintained under mechanical ventilation. The serum potassium level was kept in the range of 5.0 to 5.5 mEq/L . Two milligram per\n\n【42】hour of phenylephrine and 3 mg/h diltiazem were adminis-tered intravenously， and 8 mg bisoprolol tape was applied. Two hours after ICU admission， she showed signs of hemodynam-ic collapse， because of the decrease of cardiac preload due to hemorrhage from the surgical wound. Her deteriorated hemo-dynamics were not improved after intensive fluid replacement. The pulmonary artery pressure increased from 40 mmHg to50 mmHg， and the central venous pressure was elevated from14 mmHg to 20 mmHg， without an increase in BP. Furthermore， the cardiac index (CI) fell from 1.7 L/m? to 1.0 L/m2. We decid-ed to use catecholamines， namely 5 mcg/kg/min dobutamine and 0.03 mcg/kg/min noradrenaline. The phenylephrine was discontinued. The Cl increased to 2.2 to 2.7 L/m? On postop-erative day 4， the patient was started on insulin sliding ther-apy by a diabetes physician for hyperglycemia. Early in the morning of the postoperative day 4， 10 units of rapid-acting insulin were administered intravenously. One hour after ins u-lin administration， according to her ICD records， the patient had VF， and received ICD electric shocks. The VF was changed to sinus rhythm immediately. Her serum potassium level im-mediately after recovery was 3.2 mEq/L. The monitored ECG， which was checked after the event， showed a prolonged QTc interval of 643 m/s， and the VF occurred as R on T from the\n\n【43】intrusion of premature ventricular contraction . The hypokalemia was thought to have been caused by the insu-lin therapy initiated that day. In addition to potassium sup plementation， bisoprolol was restarted. She was discharged from the ICU on postoperative day 5 without event. Later，the RR interval and QT interval (from the onset of the QRS com-plex to the end of the T wave) were measured manually. The QT interval was adjusted for the patient's heart rate using the Bazett formula (QTc=QT/\\[RR/1，000\\]1/2).\n\n【44】Discussion\n\n【45】In the present case， VF following TdP occurred， probably due to hypokalemia and catecholamines， in a patient with LQT1 af-ter surgical aortic valve replacement. LQT1 is characterized by mutations in the KCNQ1 gene causing a loss of lks.\n\n【46】There are 2 key points in the perioperative management of patients with LQT1 syndrome： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> adrenergic stimuli， especial-ly β1 activation， should be avoided or β blockers should be used if needed， and 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> drugs that can prolong action poten-tial duration and consequently the QT interval on ECG or elec-trolyte disorders， particularly hypokalemia， should be avoided.\n\n【47】Cardiac events in patients with LQT1 syndrome are frequently triggered by adrenergic stimuli， such as physical or emotion-al stress. Cardiac repolarization is controlled by the outward current of rapidly (lkr) and slowly (Iks) activating delayed rec-tifier potassium current channels and the inward current of L-type Ca\"+ channel current Icap； thus， they are the most im-portant determinants of action potential duration. Unlike at rest， when Ikr， but not Iks， plays an important role in control-ling the action potential， Iks plays a dominant role in regulat-ing an action potential after adrenergic stimuli. In a state of activated adrenergic stimuli， including exercise， inward cur-rents of Ica increase due to L-type Ca’+ channel activation by cAMP-dependent kinase phosphorylation； however， the exces-sive inward currents can be suppressed by the activation of phosphorylated Iks channels. However， in a patient with LQT1syndrome， dysfunctional Iks channels are unable to suppress excessive inward currents， resulting in prolonged action poten-tial duration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.On the other hand， it has been reported that hypokalemia， a reduction in extracellular potassium， acutely decreases the amplitude of Ikr in cardiomyocytes and induc-es reduction in the cell surface Ikr channels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【48】In the present case， the patient had an ICD because of sever-al episodes of TdP and VF， and was administered bisoprolol and verapamil before surgery. In the operating room， we did not use β blockers but continuously administered diltiazem， a calcium channel blocker. In addition， we decided not to useβ stimulant drugs and， instead， used phenylephrine， a pure\n\n【49】o. stimulant， in order to maintain BP. Furthermore， we main-tained the serum potassium ion level in the range of 4.5 to5.0 mEq/mL. However， in the ICU， after the patient was pre-cipitated to hypovolemic shock due to hemorrhage from the surgical wound， the patient’s hemodynamics deteriorated： the BP decreased； pulmonary artery and central venous pressure increased； and there was a marked Cl decrease. Therefore， we administered dobutamine and noradrenaline. However， after insulin administration to correct the hyperglycemia， VF sud-denly occurred following TdP， probably due to hypokalemia(3.2 mEq/L) in addition to the catecholamines. Even though poorly controlled diabetes also increases the risk of fatal ar-rhythmias in patients with prolonged QT syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>， more attention should have been paid to insulin use. Specifically， to reduce potassium fluctuations， insulin boluses should have been avoided， or the number of units should have been re-duced， and continuous administration of insulin should have been considered. Serum potassium levels should have been monitored immediately after insulin administration. After cor-rection of the hypokalemia and bisoprolol use， lethal arrhyth-mias were not observed. It was imperative to use catechol-amines because the patient had heart failure after hypovolemic shock； however， we should have used a B blocker as well and carefully monitored serum potassium levels.\n\n【50】General anesthetics also affect the QT interval 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In general， volatile anesthetics， such as sevoflurane， isoflurane， and des-flurane， inhibit Ikr and prolong the QT interval. In contrast， propofol does not inhibit Ikr and does not induce QT prolon-gation. Theoretically， propofol is safer than volatile anesthet-ics in terms of anesthetic management of patients with LQTS. We used propofol in the present case. A review reported that128 of 158 (81%) patients with LQTS were anesthetized with volatile anesthetics and there was no correlation between gen-eral anesthetics and the chance of TdP， and 76% (120/158) of patients took β blockers in the morning of surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Based on this report， β blocker use is important for the anesthetic management of patients with LQTS通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【51】Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is a more reasonable option for the patient because， in most cases， patients do not need catecholamines during and after surgery and there is lit-tle chance of surgical bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>. At the time of our expe-rience with this case， our facility could not perform transcath-eter aortic valve replacement on this patient quickly enough， so we performed surgical aortic valve replacement. Today， we would have opted for transcatheter aortic valve replacement.\n\n【52】Conclusions\n\n【53】administration in addition to catecholamines. It is important to check serum potassium levels to avoid the onset of TdP in patients with LQTS.\n\n【54】References：\n\n【55】1\\. Mizusawa Y， Horie M， Wilde AAM.

It is commonly found incidentally on imaging and is usually benign but has significant potential to recur as a malignant tumor. Patients present as-ymptomatically or with pulmonary symptoms such as cough or shortness of breath. Cardiac invasion of an SFT can create an avenue for peripheral tumor embolization and critical limb ischemia， as in this case report. There is no prior published report of recurring malignant SFT presenting as critical limb ischemia.\n\n【20】Case Report： We report a rare presentation of malignant SFT recurrence in a 57-year-old woman with critical limb ischemia of both lower extremities secondary to bilateral tumor emboli. The patient's primary tumor was treated with surgical resection alone. Upon recurrence， the tumor growth was so extensive that it was no longer amenable to surgical resection at the time of her critical limb ischemia. The patient presented with bilateral numbness and tingling， without any pulmonary symptoms.\n\n【21】Conclusions：\n\n【22】Although it is sporadic， clinicians should know that an aggressive malignant SFT can embolize and present as critical limb ischemia. The possibility of tumor emboli provides a pressing reason to surgically resect SFT mass-es in their early stages before any cardiac invasion.\n\n【23】Keywords： Solitary Fibrous Tumor， Pleural· Embolism·Solitary Fibrous Tumors · Neoplasm Metastasis·Angiography， Digital Subtraction\n\n【24】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/935445\n\n【25】A solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is a rare mesenchymal tumor of fibroblastic origin that involves the pleura in 30% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. SFT usually presents in older adults between ages 60 and 70years old with pulmonary symptoms such as cough， short-ness of breath， chest pain， pneumothorax， or hemothorax 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Overall， most patients with SFT are asymptomatic， and thus most cases are discovered incidentally on imaging. Diagnosis is confirmed by pathology. Although mostly considered be-nign， up to 30% of these tumors transform to malignant， and thus early detection is vital 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Presenting symptoms of SFT are usually nonspecific and variable， especially since SFT can present with local disease， locally invasive disease， and meta-static disease in rare cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. This case presentation focuses on the sporadic presentation of critical limb ischemia caused by tumor emboli in a 57-year-old woman.\n\n【26】Case Report\n\n【27】A 57-year-old woman with a history of left-sided malignant thoracic SFT status after resection in 2018 with no histo-ry of chemotherapy or radiation treatment presented to the Emergency Department with sudden onset of bilateral lower extremity numbness and weakness. Her associated symptoms were notable for an ongoing non-productive cough， short-ness of breath， intermittent palpitations， and myalgias in the months leading up to her hospitalization. She was being eval-uated on an outpatient basis for a new left-sided 11-cm chest mass  that was presumed to be a recurrence of SFT but was still awaiting tissue diagnosis. Her past medical his-tory included hypertension， prediabetes， COVID-19， and epi-lepsy， with her last grand mal seizure occurring over 20 years ago. The patient was a nonsmoker， and her family history was noncontributory.\n\n【28】Physical exam findings were significant for a complete absence of left-sided lung sounds and decreased sensation in her bilat-eral lower extremities. Pedal pulses were intact， and the bilat-eral lower extremities were pink and warm. Blood pressure and heart rate were elevated at 241/134 mmHg and 145 beats per minute， respectively. Oxygen saturation was 94% on room air.\n\n【29】Several hours later， the patient's left toes appeared cyanotic， and her left lower extremity felt cool upon palpation. While the bilateral venous duplex ultrasound was negative， the arterial duplex showed probable obstruction of the popliteal arteries. An angiogram later confirmed bilateral popliteal artery occlusions ， which were likely acute in na-ture given the lack of other chronic vascular disease or collat-eralization. Due to significant pain， the patient could not tol-erate percutaneous thrombectomy during angiography. She\n\n【30】A\n\n【31】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

Imaging findings demonstrated that the tumor directly invaded the left ventricle， making this a site suspicious for the origin of the tumor emboli. Smaller meta-static foci in the contralateral lung and left superior phrenic mass were also seen.\n\n【38】Postoperative angiography revealed restored popliteal flow， corroborating the regained sensation in bilateral lower extremities.

The patient was discharged a few days later and transferred to a tertiary care facility for further evaluation and cardiovascular surgical considerations. The chest mass was ultimately deemed unre-sectable due to its size and local invasion， and the patient was given a 1 to 2-year prognosis pending immediate chemothera-py. She was referred to palliative care for further management.\n\n【39】40X\n\n【40】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4. (A) Hypercellular tumor emboli associated with organizing fibrin and red blood cells.

Peripheral arterial embolization of tumors is a rare etiology for limb ischemia and is an uncommon initial pre-sentation of cancer. This patient's lung mass was delayed and may have contributed to this advanced presentation. While most cases of SFT are asymptomatic， the possible generation of tumor emboli provides an important reason for immediate treatment via resection. While surgery is the mainstay of treat-ment， neoadjuvant radiation or chemotherapy and adjuvant ra-diation are included on a case-by-case basis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Anthracyclines are the chemotherapeutic of choice， although more data are needed to establish definitive outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Due to high vas-cularity， embolization is sometimes performed before resec-tion， and antiangiogenic treatments are also a new option.\n\n【45】Cases of tumor emboli as the presenting disease symptom have been documented for malignant melanoma， germ cell tumor， lung cancer， and other cancers. Tumor emboli gener-ally occur due to cardiac involvement of a pulmonary tumor， with few cases due to metastatic invasion of vessels or other\n\n【46】extracardiac involvement. In a similar case report， malignant fibrous histiocytoma presented as tumor emboli when part of the mass was directly attached to the thoracic wall， with aor-tic involvement creating a pathway for peripheral emboliza-tion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Similarly， a metastatic parotid tumor presented with acute limb ischemia from left ventricle involvement and sub-sequent embolization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【47】In this case， CT demonstrates the tumor invading through the left ventricle， particularly in the sagittal view . Nearby vasculature was recruited， including the pulmonary ar-tery and vein， inferior phrenic artery， and intercostal vessels. Cardiac involvement of the left ventricle prob-ably provided the pathway for peripheral tumor emboli， but the recruitment of the pulmonary vessels， as demonstrated by CT angiography， can provide alternative pathways as well.\n\n【48】It is crucial to consider tumor emboli as a severe consequence of malignancy in patients with a known history of thoracic ma-lignancy with evidence or potential for cardiac involvement. For patients presenting with symptoms of limb ischemia and typ-ical chest pathology symptoms， malignancy and tumor emboli should be included in the differential diagnosis to prevent de-lays in diagnosis and resection of the primary mass. Because tumor emboli are likely a late-stage presentation of malignant SFT， the primary mass may not be amenable to surgical treat-ment， as in this case report. New research about the molec-ular signaling mechanisms that drive malignant SFT growth paves the way for advanced treatment options 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【49】References：\n\n【50】1\\.

It is a multisystem disorder most commonly affecting the eyes， central nervous system， and kid-neys. These commonly manifest as congenital cataracts， intellectual disability， and proximal renal dysfunction(Fanconi-type). Epidermal lesions are an uncommon manifestation of this condition， and the association is not completely understood.\n\n【25】Case Report： Here we present a case of a 9-year-old boy with Lowe syndrome who presented with multiple cystic masses found in the perianal region. An excision was then performed to remove the masses and found that the le-sions were epidermal cysts， which are infrequently found in Lowe syndrome. After excision， the patient recov-ered uneventfully without complications.\n\n【26】Conclusions： While epidermal cysts are an uncommon manifestation that have been documented， our case remains unique given the location and associated symptoms of the lesions. At presentation， the constellation of pain and peri-anal masses was concerning for a malignant etiology However， after diagnostic imaging was performed， these lesions were found to be epidermal cysts， an infrequent manifestation of Lowe syndrome. Few previous case re-ports described cystic lesions in association with Lowe syndrome， and none， to our knowledge， have described multiple symptomatic perianal lesions. This case is important to consider because epidermal cystic lesions can be found with this presentation and should be considered on differential diagnoses for dermatologic findings in Lowe syndrome patients.\n\n【27】Keywords： Epidermal Cyst·Oculocerebrorenal Syndrome ·Pediatrics\n\n【28】Ful-text PDE https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/938248\n\n【29】Publisher's note： All daims expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of their affiliated\n\n【30】AP\n\n【31】organizations， or those of the publisher the editors and the reviewers.

It is a mul-tisystem disorder characterized by abnormalities in the eye， nervous system， and kidneys 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. These commonly manifest as congenital cataracts， intellectual disability， and proximal renal dysfunction (Fanconi-type). Other cardinal features in-clude isolated kidney dysfunction， severe progressive growth retardation， neonatal hypotonia， areflexia， seizures， arthrop-athy， and behavioral problems 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Less-commonly described manifestations of Lowe syndrome include epidermal cysts. In this case report we report multiple perianal epidermal cysts found in a 9-year-old boy， an uncommon presentation of Lowe syndrome， not previously described in the literature to our knowledge 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>.\n\n【33】This is a case of a 9-year-old boy with a history of Lowe syn-drome， congenital cataracts， hypotonic cerebral palsy， devel-opmental delay， epilepsy， congenital dysplasia of the hips， and neurogenic bowel and bladder who presented with multiple perianal masses that were suspected of being epidermal cysts， an uncommon manifestation in Lowe syndrome. The diagnosis of Lowe syndrome was confirmed in June of 2020 via whole-exome sequencing， which found a hemizygous variant in the classically associated OCRL1 gene. The mother reported that there had been a large perianal lesion for 2-3 years followed by 6-8 months of 2 smaller perianal lesions appearing. The le-sions caused intermittent pain and discomfort， but the mother denied any erythema， changes to skin， bleeding， or discharge. Physical exam revealed 3 bulging perianal masses with the largest being at the left inferior position and 2 smaller lesions superiorly， near the gluteal cleft .\n\n【34】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1. Gross and MRI images of 3 perianal cystic masses. A) Lesion located to the right of the coccyx. B) The most superior lesion located to the left of the coccyx.

(B) H&E stain at 200x magnification displaying epithelial lining of one of the cysts.</u>\n\n【36】A pelvis MRI with and without contrast was ordered to further define the masses. The imaging found 3 well-circumscribed， rounded lesions in the soft tissue adjacent to the gluteal cleft. The largest， most inferior lesion was found in the left perirectal region and measured 3.3×2.5×3.8 cm， with a cystic appearance. The most superior lesion was found to the left of the coccyx and measured 1.8×1.6×2.4 cm. The third lesion was found to the right of the coccyx and measured 2.4x2.0×2.4 cm. The 2relatively smaller lesions appeared to be marginally heterog-enous in comparison to the larger， simpler lesion . Given that the lesions appeared amenable to complete exci-sion， it was deemed reasonable to consider excisional biopsy rather than fine-needle aspiration， which may not have been helpful given the cystic nature of the lesions.\n\n【37】The patient was then scheduled for a surgical excision of the3 subcutaneous masses. Specimens consisted of an inferior perianal mass measuring 4.5x4x2.5 cm， a left gluteal mass measuring 3x2.5×1.5 cm， and a right gluteal mass measuring2.5×2×1.5 cm. Postoperatively， the patient had an unevent-ful course and was discharged to home in good condition on the same day.\n\n【38】The pathology report was significant for 3 epidermal (infundib-ular) cysts. The left inferior perianal mass weighed 29.4 grams， the left superior gluteal mass weighed 9.5 grams， and the right superior gluteal mass weighed 7.2 grams. All 3 masses were well-encapsulated cystic structures with a smooth outer sur-face， and upon opening revealed a hollowed cystic structure with a smooth inner lining. The masses were all filled with a thick gray keratinaceous material .\n\n【39】Two subsequent clinic follow-ups at 1 week and 2 months re-vealed 3 well-healing incisions with no signs of infection or le-sion recurrence. The patient’s mother was then informed that they could follow-up as needed.\n\n【40】The primary cause of Lowe syndrome is a mutation of the OCRL1gene localized at Xq 26. It is inherited in an X-linked recessive fashion but has also been attributed to de novo mutations at this locus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Normally， the gene encodes a lipid phosphatase known as phosphatidylinositol 4， 5-bisphosphate-5-phospha-tase (OCRL1) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. This phosphatase is localized in the Golgi net-work， with very diverse roles， dependent on the cell type it is localized in 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. These include membrane trafficking， phago-cytosis， cell adhesion and migration， cell polarity， ciliogenesis， cytokinesis， and intracellular signaling. A common theme ex-ists， in that most processes affected by the loss of OCRL1 pro-tein are actin-dependent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. This coincides with the primary underlying diagnosis of our patient due to the mutation in the OCRL1 gene being identified on a previous genetic analysis.\n\n【41】Manifestations of this condition are characterized by the tri-ad of abnormalities within the eyes， nervous system， and the kidneys. Skin lesions have also been associated with this syn-drome， but the relationship is poorly understood. Some cli-nicians have suggested that the mutation in Lowe syndrome also provokes cyst formation， but cysts are not currently con-sidered a clinical feature of Lowe syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. A single-insti-tution case series by Kim et al described the clinical features of 12 male patients with confirmed diagnosis of Lowe syn-drome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>； all 12 of their patients had growth failure and de-velopmental delay，and 11 ofthe 12 had congenital cataracts. Additionally， seizures occurred in 50% of their patients. Our patient also displayed these symptoms， supporting the under-lying diagnosis of Lowe syndrome.\n\n【42】The child described in our case had the classic triad of abnor-malities for Lowe syndrome， along with multiple epidermal cystic lesions， an uncommon manifestation of Lowe syndrome not previously described as localizing to the perianal area and\n\n| Article reviewed  | Presentation  | Signs and symptoms  | Location of cyst(s)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Won et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>  | 6-year-old male  | Asymptomatic  | Temporal and occipital scalp  |\n| Kim et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>  | 18-year-old male  | Not mentioned  | Back or buttocks  |\n|  | 16-year-old male  | Not mentioned  | Back or buttocks  |\n|  | 23-year-old male  | Not mentioned  | Back or buttocks  |\n|  | 24-year-old male  | Not mentioned  | Back or buttocks  |\n|  | 1-year-old male  | Not mentioned  | Back or buttocks  |\n| Nandedkar et al \\[91  | 20-year-old male  | Asymptomatic  | Midchest  |\n| Ikehara et al 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>  | 9-year-old male  | Asymptomatic  | Occipital scalp  |\n\n【44】being symptomatic  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4，9，10\\]</u>. Won et al reported a case of a 6-year-old boy with multiple asymptomatic cystic le-sions found on the temporal and occipital scalp 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The his-tologic description of the cystic masses described in their pa-per closely resemble the perianal cystic masses found in our case. Kim et al also found that 5 of the 12 patients they re-ported with Lowe syndrome developed epidermal cysts， but they did not report perianal manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Other report-ed cutaneous cystic lesions described in Lowe syndrome in-clude vellus hair cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Therefore，the presentation of mul-tiple symptomatic perianal cystic masses found in our case， to our knowledge， has not been previously described in the lit-erature  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4，8-10\\]</u>. This is important to consider due to the fact that the original presentation led our team to con-sider malignant etiologies. After diagnostic imaging was per-formed， however， it became clear that these masses were in fact benign-appearing cystic masses.\n\n【45】The exact mechanism of cystic lesions formation is unknown， but some studies have suggested that it is related to abnormal levels ofextracellular lysosomal enzymes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Nandekar et al reported a case of eruptive vellus hair cysts that displayed ab-normally high levels of these extracellular lysosomal enzymes. It is suggested that the loss of cellular control due to accumu-lation of PIP2 and extracellular release of lysosomal enzymes leads to cyst formation. The cysts are believed to appear as a local defense against destructive enzymes that accumulate as a result of extracellular lysosomal enzymes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【46】Akin to the technique described in Won et al， the epidermal lesions in this case were similarly removed via excision 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Despite cyst removal， a study suggested that recurrence of cu-taneous cysts to be as high as 42%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Of note， when excision is performed， hemostasis may be difficult to achieve due to platelet dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Recker et al reported that tranexam-ic acid improves platelet function in patients with Lowe syn-drome， so it can be considered perioperatively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Despite an increased risk of bleeding， our patient tolerated the procedure\n\n【47】well without the need for additional therapies to support he-mostasis. On follow-up with the patient， no evidence of recur-rence has been detected.\n\n【48】There are some reasons why these cysts with an unusual pre-sentation in Lowe syndrome should be considered. The first is that effective management through excision is available， as stated previously. Another is due to the fact that， although rare， malignant transformation is possible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Possible trans-formations include squamous cell carcinoma， basal cell car-cinoma， and Merkel cell carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Each of these malig-nancies carry its own set of risks， so identification of these cysts is important for effective management of patients with Lowe syndrome.\n\n【49】Therefore， epidermal cysts are an association of Lowe syn-drome. However， the perianal location and symptomatic na-ture of these cysts are rare. Our primary goal with this paper was to reiterate that unusual locations of epidermal cyst can be seen with this syndrome. Thus， epidermal cysts should be kept in the list of differential diagnoses if unusual cysts are encountered in patients with Lowe syndrome.\n\n【50】Conclusions\n\n【51】The novelty of our case is the presentation of multiple symp-tomatic perianal epidermal cystic lesions. At presentation， the constellation of pain and perianal masses was concerning for a malignant etiology. However， after diagnostic imaging was per-formed， these lesions were found to be epidermal cysts， which is an uncommon manifestation of Lowe syndrome. Previous case reports have described cystic lesions in association with Lowe syndrome， but none， to our knowledge， have described multiple symptomatic perianal lesions. This case highlights the effectiveness of excision in treating patients with cutane-ous manifestations from Lowe syndrome， with relatively low morbidity. Proper identification of epidermal cysts in patients\n\n【52】with Lowe syndrome can assist in effective management and treatment options and help prevent possible negative out-comes for similar cases. Therefore， it is important to consid-er these lesions in the differential diagnosis of unusual cystic masses in Lowe syndrome because， with timely identification and excision，patients may be relieved of discomfort in a safe and efficient approach.\n\n【53】References：\n\n【54】1\\.

The affected areas are generally re-stricted to the radiation field or to the nearby surrounding area.\n\n【24】Case Report：\n\n【25】A 67-year-old Japanese woman with a history of right breast cancer followed by adjuvant radiotherapy was referred our hospital because of 7-year history of symmetrical indurated erythematous plaques on her trunk. Three months after completion of irradiation， erythematous plaques developed on her right chest and gradual-ly spread accompanied tenderness. She did not have a history of trauma to her right chest. Laboratory testing was positive for antinuclear antibody test at 1： 640 but negative for anti-SS-A/B， anti-U1-RNP，anti-DNA， anti-Sm， anticentromere， anti-topoisomerase l antibodies， and Borrelia and cytomegalovirus infection. She had no Raynaud's phenomenon， sclerodactyly or nail-fold bleeding. She did not have interstitial lung disease or oth-er internal organ involvement. A biopsy specimen revealed reticular dermal fibrosis with thickened collagen bundles with superficial and deep perivascular infiltration of mononuclear cells. These findings were consis-tent with morphea. Furthermore， mucin deposition was present in the papillary dermis upon Alcian blue stain-ing， which has been reported to be observed in generalized morphea. Consequently， a diagnosis of generalized morphea induced by radiotherapy was made. She had been treated with oral hydroxychloroquine sulfate， re-sulting in the resolution of tenderness but the erythematous plaques remained.\n\n【26】Conclusions：\n\n【27】To the best of our knowledge， this is the first report of radiation-induced generalized morphea with prominent mucin deposition.

Morphea is different from systemic sclerosis in that it lacks acrosclerosis， internal organ involvement， and Raynaud's phe-nomenon. Generalized morphea， the most severe form， is char-acterized by multiple sclerotic plaques. Although the patho-genesis of morphea remains unknown， autoimmunity is one of the central features of morphea. Patients with morphea， especially generalized morphea， have various autoantibod-ies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Furthermore，trauma and infection with Borrelia burg-dorferi and cytomegalovirus have been thought to induce mor-phea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Radiation-induced morphea is a rare complication of radiation therapy that has been estimated to occur in 1 in500 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The majority of cases have occurred in pa-tients with breast cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Its onset ranges from 1 month to 3 years， although there is 1 reported case developing 32years after radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，5，6\\]</u>. The affected areas have gen-erally been restricted to the radiation field or to the nearby surrounding area in the majority of previously reported cases， whereas only a few previous cases have had skin lesions ex-tending beyond the irradiated area 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，7-9\\]</u>. We here describe a patient with radiation-induced generalized morphea with unique clinical features.\n\n【31】A 67-year-old Japanese woman diagnosed as having right breast cancer had undergone local excision of the right breast， followed by adjuvant radiotherapy to the right breast and ax-illa. Three months after completion of irradiation， erythema-tous plaques developed on her right chest. The lesions gradu-ally spread and became tender. She was initially treated with topical corticosteroids， tacrolimus， and narrow-band ultravio-let B irradiation at another hospital without any improvement. Seven years later， she was referred to us with symmetrical in-durated erythematous plaques on her trunk . She had a family history of autoimmune diseases； 2 of her 4sisters had systemic lupus erythematosus and 1 had rheuma-toid arthritis. She had no Raynaud’s phenomenon， sclerodac-tyly， or nail-fold bleeding. Laboratory investigations showed positive antinuclear antibody test (1：640， speckled)， but an-ti-SS-A/B， anti-U1-RNP， anti-DNA， anti-Sm， anticentromere， and anti-topoisomerase I antibodies were all negative. Chest computed tomography did not show interstitial lung disease or other diseases. She did no have renal or digestive diseas-es. A biopsy specimen obtained from the right upper abdo-men histologically revealed reticular dermal fibrosis with thick-ened collagen bundles with superficial and deep perivascular infiltration of mononuclear cells . Direct immu-nofluorescence was negative. These findings were consistent with morphea， although mucin deposition shown by Alcian blue staining was present in the papillary dermis .\n\n【32】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2. (A， B) Marked dermal fibrosis with thickened collagen bundles (hematoxylin and eosin). (C) Dermal perivascular infiltration of mononuclear cells (hematoxylin and eosin). (D) Presence of mucin deposition in the upper dermis (Alcian blue stain).</u>\n\n【33】She did not have any history of trauma on her right chest. Furthermore， she had negative results for Borrelia and cyto-megalovirus infection. Consequently， a diagnosis of generalized morphea induced by radiotherapy was made. She had been treated with oral hydroxychloroquine sulfate at 200 mg dai-ly for 6 months， resulting in the resolution of tenderness but the indurated erythematous plaques remained.\n\n【34】Discussion\n\n【35】Our case is unique because the skin lesions extended far be-yond the field of radiotherapy and showed symmetrical plaques， resembling systemic sclerosis rather than morphea. However， skin sclerosis normally begins from the fingers and advances towards the center of the body in systemic sclerosis， unlike our case. This is the first reported case of radiation-induced generalized morphea with symmetrical widespread lesions. Irradiated dermal fibroblasts showed increased mRNA expres-sion of transforming growth factor-p， tissue inhibitor of metal-loprotease-1， and Smad3 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>， which are thought to play key roles in the development of morphea and systemic sclerosis.\n\n【36】Furthermore， patients with systemic sclerosis have been re-ported to develop exaggerated skin fibrosis following radio-therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Our case had a positive antinuclear antibody with a strong family history of autoimmune diseases， suggesting that she was genetically susceptible to autoimmune diseases. Therefore， radiotherapy might have affected dermal fibroblasts， and initiated the development of skin fibrosis. Long-term fol-low-up is essential to determine whether our case develops typical clinical features of systemic sclerosis such as sclero-dactyly or Raynaud's phenomenon.\n\n【37】Prominent mucin deposition in the papillary dermis in our case is not considered a typical pathological feature of morphea. It is unclear whether mucin deposition is commonly seen in radi-ation-induced morphea， because none of the previous reports have mentioned the presence of mucin deposition. Interestingy， it has been reported that mucin deposition was observed in all of the 7 cases of systemic sclerosis， 3 cases of morphea， and 10 cases of generalized morphea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In addition， mucin deposition was seen in the deep dermis in 18 out of these 20cases， whereas 2 cases of generalized morphea exhibited mu-cin deposition in the upper dermis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>， suggesting that mucin\n\n【38】deposition in the upper dermis may appear in some patients with generalized morphea. Moreover， our case had tender-ness， which is not a typical feature of morphea. The presence of pain has been reported in several previous cases of radia-tion-induced morphea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6，8，13-16\\]</u>， indicating that pain may be a characteristic feature of radiation-induced morphea. It has been reported that 26% of patients with morphea expe-rienced pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>， although there are no other studies report-ing the presence of pain in patients with morphea. Therefore， further studies are required to assess the presence of mucin deposition and pain associated with morphea， including radi-ation-induced morphea.\n\n【39】Little is known about treatment of radiation-induced mor-phea. Although the natural history of radiation-induced mor-phea remains obscure， in some cases skin lesions have re-solved， without intervention， as morphea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，18\\]</u>. Topical or oral corticosteroids， topical tacrolimus， topical calcipotriol， sys-temic antibiotics， ultraviolet A irradiation， and methotrexate have been used with varying degrees of success 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-8，19，20\\]</u>. Although narrow-band ultraviolet B irradiation has been re-ported to resolve both sclerosis and tenderness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>， our case showed a poor response to not only topical corticosteroids，\n\n【40】References：\n\n【41】1\\.

It is crucial to investigate potential underlying causes of sudden neurological deficit in the Emergency Department (ED) to enhance better recog-nition and proper care.\n\n【20】Case Report： A 63-year-old man presented to the ED with left-sided weakness and headache of a 2-week duration.Ischemic stroke was preliminarily diagnosis in the ED. Brain computed tomography (CT) showed an abnormality in the right parietal lobe. A chest X-ray showed right lung opacity， suggesting a mass in the right upper lobe of the lung. Subsequently， malignancy was suspected. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRl) showed lesions in the right temporal and right parietal region. CT scans of the chest， abdomen， and pelvis were ordered to identify the primary source of malignancy. Multiple nodules within the lungs and liver were found； a biopsy was taken from the nodules and sent to the Pathology Laboratory. Final impression made after the results was primary lung adenocarcinoma with brain and liver metastasis. The patient was referred to Palliative Care team by the Oncology team after malignancy workup to get the proper attention.\n\n【21】Conclusions： A hypodense area in CT/MRI with unilateral weakness and headache does not necessarily mean that there is an underlying stroke.

The clinical manifestations of brain metastasis include in-creased intracranial pressure，headache， alteration of the lev el of consciousness， seizures， and focal neurological deficits. Left-sided weakness is one of the recognized symptoms of brain metastasis； however， it is uncommon as the first pre-sentation of lung adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The presentation of sudden focal weakness in the Emergency Department (ED) is more likely to be associated with stroke. We are herein report-ing a unique case report of a patient with left-sided weakness and headache as a first presentation of lung adenocarcinoma with brain metastasis.\n\n【26】Case Report\n\n【27】A 63-year-old Saudi man， with no medical history and a30-pack-year smoking history， presented to the ED with weak-ness involving the left upper and lower limbs as well as a headache for the previous 2 weeks. He reported unintention-al weight loss of 6 kg in the previous couple of weeks， asso-ciated with lack of appetite， and gave a history of subjective fever and night sweats. He had no cough， chest pain， short-ness of breath， dysphagia， or hemoptysis. He denied other neu-rological symptoms， including loss of consciousness， convul-sions， dysarthria， dysphasia， or memory loss， according to his son. The patient's brother died from laryngeal cancer. On the clinical examination， the patient was vitally stable， conscious， and coherent. He scored 15 of 15 on the Glasgow Coma Scale. The pupils were bilaterally equally reactive， at 3 mm. The cra-nial nerves were intact. On the hand examination， clubbed\n\n【28】fingers were identified. The patient had left-sided weakness in the upper and lower limbs， with grades 4 of 5 and 3 of 5， respectively. The results of his complete blood count， liver function tests， renal function tests， amylase， lipase， and se-rum calcium all were within the normal range. A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain showed lesions with vasogenic edema in the right parietal lobe . A chest X-ray showed right lung opacity， suggesting a mass in the right upper lobe of the lung . A CT scan of the chest showed a mass in the anterior segment of the right up-per lobe ， and CT scan of the abdomen showed mul-tiple hypodense liver lesions， indicating metastasis . The impression was a primary lesion in the lung with brain and liver metastasis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed evidence of 2 ring-enhancing lesions with-in the right temporal and right parietal region， with extensive perifocal edema showing mild diffusion restriction and mid-line shift towards the left side . A bronchoscopy was unremarkable. Endobronchial ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration was done， and the biopsy was taken from the 4R lymph node； a total of 6 specimens were taken. Three speci-mens were stained with Diff-Quik stain and 3 were prepared unstained. The slides were fixed by Spray-Cyte and sent to the Pathology Laboratory， which showed that the patient’s sam-ple was positive for malignancy， since there were clusters of malignant epithelial cells with enlarged hyperchromatic pleo-morphic nuclei with coarse chromatin. Cell-block immunostain-ing showed positive reactivity of the malignant cells to CK-7， TTF-1， and focally for Napsin-A. These findings indicated prima-ry lung adenocarcinoma. The patient had stage Ⅳ metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. The patient was admitted to the hos-pital for a malignancy workup with weakness in the left side of the body. Dexamethasone was started at a loading dose of\n\n【29】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

Lung， melanoma， and breast cancer most commonly me-tastasize to the brain by passing through the blood and crossing the blood-brain barrier 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The clinical features vary depending on the involved site of the brain and usually manifest as head-ache， nausea and vomiting， convulsions， vision disturbances， dysarthria， and weakness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Left-or right-sided weakness is\n\n【37】a less common primary presentation of brain metastasis from lung carcinoma， with a reported incidence of neurological pre-sentations and focal deficits of 61.3% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. It is important to note that studies regarding the incidence of focal neurologic deficits in patients with lung cancer are limited， and the true incidence cannot be accurately determined. A lower incidence of primary focal neurologic deficit in patients with undiagnosed lung can-cer makes it difficult to relate focal neurological deficits with the diagnosis of lung cancer， especially in the ED，where more often than not the primary objective is to rule out life-threat-ening conditions. Ironically， in the present case， the patient had visited a different hospital prior to his presentation， and he was given a diagnosis of headache and discharged.\n\n【38】A case was reported in 2013 of a male patient who was referred from the ED with a history of left-sided weakness， dysprax-ia， and dysarthria for a 1-month duration and was diagnosed with primary left-sided lung cancer with extensive metastasis.\n\n【39】Another case was reported in 2002 of a 66-year-old woman who was admitted to the Neurosurgery Department with a his-tory of dizziness， headache， and numbness of the left arm for1 month before admission. The left arm showed hypesthesia and mild hemiparesis. A diagnosis of lung cancer with multi-ple brain metastasis was made. Brain lesions were treated us-ing gamma knife radiology. After treatment， the patient was given oral administration of gefitinib.\n\n【40】In our case， the patient presented to the ED with a 2-week histo-ry of left upper and lower limb weakness and headache. Primary lung adenocarcinoma with brain metastasis was diagnosed.\n\n【41】In comparison，headache was a common symptom of the cases mentioned. However， treatment was different. The treatment for our case was dexamethasone and levetiracetam， while an-other case used gamma knife radiology and gefitinib. Our pa-tient was referred to palliative care， and other patients were able to recover\n\n【42】When lung cancer is suspected， there are some laboratory and radiological investigations to be done to confirm the diagno-sis and to exclude possible metastasis.Abnormal laboratory results， such as hypercalcemia， anemia， and electrolyte imbal-ance， could indicate possible underlying malignancy. A chest X-ray is the initial radiological investigation done， followed by chest CT. Positron emission tomography with fluorodeox-yglucose is used for the detection of metastasis. Also， CT of the abdomen is used to detect liver metastasis.MRI helps in the detection of the invasion of the tumor to the great blood\n\n【43】vessels， heart chamber， chest wall， and spinal cord. CT and MRI should be done to rule out brain metastasis. In the pres-ent case， all the laboratory investigations were within the nor-mal range. However， CT of the brain， MRI of the brain， chest X-ray， chest CT， and abdominal CT all showed abnormalities， including brain metastasis， lung nodules， and liver metasta-sis， respectively通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>\n\n【44】MRI with contrast is the criterion standard diagnostic meth-od in patients with suspected brain metastasis. Metastasis can affect any compartment of the central nervous system. However， it most commonly affects the skull or the brain pa-renchyma. There are different cases reported with the condi-tion. A case was reported in 2013 of a 59-year-old man who presented with headache and problems with balance. A T1-weighted MRI with contrast showed ring enhancement and extensive vasogenic edema. A biopsy was taken from a lung mass and showed non-small cell lung cancer.\n\n【45】In another case of a 44-year-old woman， CT was done and showed left frontal hemorrhage with hyperdense lesions. T1-weighted MRI with contrast showed multiple lesions with en-hancement. Also， a biopsy revealed small cell lung cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In the present case， a brain MRI showed 2 ring-enhancing le-sions within the right parietal and temporal region with perifo-cal edema， and the biopsy result showed lung adenocarcinoma.\n\n【46】Conclusions\n\n【47】A hypodense area in CT/MRI with unilateral weakness and headache does not necessarily mean that there is an underly-ing stroke. However， it can represent brain metastasis. In this case report， we aim to increase awareness that the hypodensi-ty in the brain could represent brain metastasis， not necessari-ly simple ischemic stroke. Therefore， further workup should be done to avoid missed diagnoses， as the approach is different.\n\n【48】Department and Institution Where Work Was Done\n\n【49】Emergency Department， King Fahad University Hospital， Khobar， Saudi Arabia， and College of Medicine， Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University， Dammam， Saudi Arabia.\n\n【50】Declaration of Figures’Authenticity\n\n【51】All figures submitted have been created by the authors who confirm that the images are original with no duplication and have not been previously published in whole or in part.\n\n【52】1\\.

Hemangiopericytoma is usually misdiagnosed as meningiomas clinically because of the similar location and images.

Neurological examinations showed defect of visual fields (right homonymous hemianopsia) and decrease of muscle strength of right side limbs scored as 4/5.

Besides， the tumor invaded the inner table of calvarial bone through the dura membrane.</u>\n\n【29】(MR) imaging of brain showed the giant tumor， measuring about 7.1 x 5 x 5.5 cm in size， appeared as iso- to hypointense on T1-weighted images，  iso- to hyperintense on T2-weighted images and heterogenous strong enhancement with gadolinium. Highly grade glioma， metastatic neoplams or malignant meningioma was highly suspected. Then she underwent a craniotomy surgery with removal of tumor. On operation， the gray-yellowish tumor invaded the inner table of calvarial bone through the dura mater. Tumor was prone to bleed and in-vaded the adjacent parenchymal tissue. The invaded dura mater and tumor were completely removed as Simpson grade I.\n\n【30】Microscopically， the tumor was arranged in sheet like pattern and characterized by oval nuclei， scanty cytoplasm， inconspicuous nucleoli and vessel prolif-eration . The immunohistochemical stain was positive for CD34 ， but negative for glial fibrillary acidic protein and epitheg112lial mem-brane antigen. The pathology confirmed a diagnosis of hemangiopericytoma.\n\n【31】Postoperatively， previous neurological deficits recov-ered well. Adjuvant radiotherapy was also adminis trated. No recurrence or metastasis was noted during one-year follow up.\n\n【32】DISCUSSION\n\n【33】Hemangiopericytoma is a rare tumor arising from pericapillary cells or pericytes of Zimmerman and\n\n【34】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2.

However， intracranial meningeal hemangiopericy-toma， which was first described by Begg and Garret\\[S\\]， has been rarely reported. The incidence accounts for 2-4% of meningeal tumors and approximately 1%of all intracranial tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Based on the different behavior， hemangiopericytoma divides into anaplas-tic (9150/3) and non-anaplastic (9150/1) forms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Unlike meningioma， hemangiopericytoma is more common in males than females and the gender ratio(male/female) is 1.1 to 1.5 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Most hemangiopericy-toma occur during adulthood and the average age of majority of diagnosis is in the fourth or fifth decades通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Approximately 10% of hemangiopericytomas oc-cur in children通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【37】The distribution of hemangiopericytoma is similar to that of meningioma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Supratentorial region(62%) is the most common location， followed by tentorium and posterior fossa (20%) and spine (14%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The symptoms and signs are related to the size and location of the tumors. Headache or seizure is commonly presented in patients with supratentorial hemangiopericytomas， while patients with posterior fossa hemangiopericytomas present with gait distur-bance and disequilibrium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. However， in a study of11 patients with intracranial meningeal hemangio pericytomas， Fountas et al. found focal neurological deficits caused by tumor and signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure were significant more common than seizure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The mean duration of symptoms varied in series studies from less than4 months to 7.5 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，8\\]</u>.\n\n【38】For the assessment of intracranial neoplasm， MR imaging is superior to skull radiograph or CT. However， although the MR appearances are similar\n\n【39】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4. The tumor cells revealed diffuse immunoreactive for CD34(X400).</u>\n\n【40】to those of meningomas， including relative hypo-to iso-intensity on T1-weighted images (T1WI)， iso-to hyper-intense on T2-weighted images (T2WI)， and contrast enhancement after gadolinium， the find-ings of calcium within a tumor or hyperostosis of adjacent calvarium is strong evidence against the diagnosis of hemangiopericytoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Otherwise， hemangiopericytoma is also characteristic as a nar-row base of dural attachment， internal vessel voids tumor associated with bone erosion \\[71. However， the accurate diagnosis should be established from histological examination. Immunohistochemical stains such as CD34， reticulin， epithelial membrane antigen and glial fibrillary acidic protein， could be offer the most important information to distinguish between hemangiopericytomas and meningiomas or other meningeal tumors.\n\n【41】Surgical intervention with total removal of the tumor is the best therapeutic modality to treat intracranial hemangiopericytoma because of the aggressive behavior that tend to occur at an earlier age than other meningeal tumors， recur with high frequency， and metastasize extracranially， predomi-nantly to bone， lung， liver， kidney， pancreas， and adrenals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. High vascularity of the tumor remains the challenge for surgeons so preoperatively intra-vascular embolization has been recommended to diminish the intraoperative blood loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. However， because the propensity of hemangiopericytoma to recur either locally or regionally within the cra-nial or spinal meninges， the incidence of local recurrence varied from 26 to 80%，depending on the quality of resection， the length of follow-up and par-ticular whether postoperative radiotherapy was ad-ministrated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.

Alterations in immune homeostasis can induce loss of peripheral tolerance and promote the development of self-reactive antibodies.\n\n【22】Primary ITP is the diagnosis of exclusion made after the extensive work-up rules out other possible causes of thrombocytopenia. The association between the ITP and other autoimmune disorders is well-established. In recent years， increasing attention has been directed toward the association between celiac disease (CD) and ITP.\n\n【23】Case Report： A 27-year-old man with a history of primary ITP presented with an occasional nosebleed， 1 episode of rectal bleeding. and easy bruising. The patient was later found to have high titers of TTG-IGA and endomysial IGA levels consistent with CD. Our patient not only failed to improve with the gluten-free diet， but also failed mul-tiple lines of treatment including steroids， IVIG， rituximab， eltrombopag， and even a non-traditional treatment for ITP (azathioprine and plasma exchange). The patient's CD-related antibody titers remained elevated.\n\n【24】Conclusions：\n\n【25】It is possible that in certain cases the alteration of immune response caused by CD with a concurrent eleva-tion of CD-related antibodies can make ITP refractory to all medical management. Whether or not this refrac-toriness to treatment is related to the persistently elevated antibody titers of CD or unknown genetic relation-ship between ITP and CD remains not entirely clear and warrants further molecular， immunologic， and genetic analysis.\n\n【26】Keywords： Allergy and Immunology· Hematologic Diseases ·Thrombocytopenia\n\n【27】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/931877\n\n【28】￥o 2\n\n【29】078\n\n【30】盟1 山可5 目日113\n\n【31】Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an incompletely understood disease， likely related to antibody-mediated de-struction of platelets (typically through IgG-antibodies direct-ed against Gpllb/llla on the platelet membrane). Other mech-anisms are likely to be important， including autoreactive Tc cells， as well as humoral and cellular autoimmunity direct-ed at megakaryocytes， causing impaired platelet production.\n\n【32】Alterations in immune homeostasis might induce loss of pe-ripheral tolerance and promote the development of self-reac-tive antibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The association between the ITP and other autoimmune disorders (including systemic lupus erythemato-sus， antiphospholipid syndrome， autoimmune lymphoprolifer-ative syndrome) is well-established. In recent years，increasing attention has been directed toward the association between ITP and celiac disease (CD) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【33】CD is a common cause of intestinal malabsorption secondary to ingestion of gluten-containing proteins in genetically predis-posed individuals. This disease affects the small bowel through the hypersensitivity reaction that causes inflammation of the mucosa， hyperplasia of the crypts， and atrophy of the villi. A gluten-free diet is the most important step in management. CD is associated with multiple autoimmune diseases (eg， type 1diabetes， autoimmune thyroid disease， and atopic dermatitis).\n\n【34】Co-occurrences of CD and ITP are reported； however， these patients are usually successfully treated with the giuten-free diet and/or medical management (eg， steroids).\n\n【35】In the current case report， we discuss a case of primary ITP as-sociated with CD， which turned out to be refractory to almost all known treatments of ITP， with some improvement of plate-let count after surgical management (splenectomy).\n\n【36】Case Report\n\n【37】A 27-year-old man was referred from the primary care physi-cian's office to the emergency department for a low platelet count of 4x10/uL The patient experienced bleeding from his nose 2 weeks prior， 1 episode of rectal bleeding， and chron-ic frequent petechiae on the skin. In addition， the patient had prolonged bleeding from minor injuries (up to 2-3 hours). Interestingly， the other presenting sign was hair loss on the scalp .\n\n【38】The patient was not on any medication and had not received any vaccinations for the past years. His past medical history included similar minor bleeding from thrombocytopenia di-agnosed as primary immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)\n\n【39】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1. Alopecia on the scalp was one of the presenting symptoms of the patient.</u>\n\n【40】in Uzbekistan in 2017 (2 years before migration to the USA). He had completed several courses of steroids and IVIG in Uzbekistan and India， with a suboptimal response. In India， the patient had refused to have a splenectomy. The patient also had a distant past medical history of tuberculosis of the right femur treated medically and surgically in Uzbekistan.\n\n【41】Except for steroids and IIG， the patient had not received any other treatments for the last 5 years. All medications that the patient received after the initial presentation are described below.\n\n【42】On presentation， the patient did not have any major bleeding or other active concerns. He had asymptomatic anemia (he-moglobin level was 11.6 g/dL) with low ferritin (21 ng/mL on the first admission， subsequently decreased to 14 ng/mL) and mild microcytosis (MCV 75-79 fL). Mean platelet volume was borderline high or elevated (as high as 13.7). Vitamin B.， fo late， coagulation studies (PT， INR， PTT)， and thyroid function were within normal range.\n\n【43】A neurological exam was unremarkable. He did not have any evidence of arthritis/arthralgia， fever， chills， night sweats， or weight changes. ESR was normal (10 mm)， and ANA and rheu-matoid factor results were negative. His kidney function re-mained normal during the entire treatment course (creatinine of 0.62-0.81 mg/dL).ANCA/complement and urine protein levels were not obtained because of the low suspicion of vasculitides and other rheumatologic/connective tissue diseases. The pa-tient did not experience any signs or symptoms of thrombosis.\n\n【44】Laboratory test results for HI， HBV， HCV， ANA，RF， RPR were all negative， and there was no evidence of EBV， CMV，VZV，or rubella. CXR ruled out active pulmonary TB. X-rays of the right femur， right knee， and right tibia/fibula were negative for acute\n\n【45】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2.

The myeloid-to-erythroid ratio(M： E) was within normal range； increased number of megakaryocytes were present， consistent with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)， no evidence of lymphoma or leukemia was seen， no stainable storage iron was noted， and no marrow fibrosis or granulomatous inflammation/necrosis identified.

Computed tomography of the chest， abdomen， and pelvis with i.v. contrast revealed no hepatosplenomegaly and no lymph node enlargement. Peripheral smear showed the ab-sence of giant platelets， occasional teardrop cells， and normal morphology of WBCs.\n\n【48】Bone marrow biopsy  revealed slightly hypercellular marrow (70%) with trilineage hematopoiesis. The myeloid-to-erythroid ratio (M： E) appeared within normal range； increased numbers of megakaryocytes were present， consistent with im-mune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)； no evidence of lympho-ma or leukemia was seen； no stainable storage iron was not-ed； and no marrow fibrosis or granulomatous inflammation/necrosis were identified. Given the past medical history of TB， the possibility of disseminated TB with bone marrow involve-ment was ruled out by negative AFB stain and culture for AFB.\n\n【49】After the described extensive evaluation ruled out other causes or triggers， the diagnosis of primary ITP was made. Hereditary megakaryocyte dysfunction was unlikely， as these are rare dis-orders usually characterized by specific clinical findings (eg， short stature and arm developmental disorders in Fanconi anemia and Diamond-Blackfan anemia)， earlier onset (often in infancy， eg， in congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytope-nia \\[C-MPL mutation\\])， involvement of other cell lineages， pe-ripheral smear， and bone marrow changes (eg， large platelets with reduced u-granules and the development of myelofibrosis\n\n【50】inside the bone marrow with Gray platelet syndrome \\[NBEAL2mutation\\]) and some family history. Our patient， with no signif-icant family history， developed petechiae and frequent nose-bleeds in his 20s； he was subsequently found to have isolat-ed thrombocytopenia， and had normal physical exam without specific clinical findings， peripheral smear， and bone marrow bi-opsy， compatible with the diagnosis of primary ITP. Bone mar-row demonstrating an increased number of megakaryocytes and no iron storage is not consistent with hereditary throm-bocytopenia， but rather with peripheral destruction of plate-lets characteristic for ITP.\n\n【51】Treatment with prednisone (1 mg/kg daily) and rifampin (as prophylaxis against the reactivation of TB)， and IVIG (1 g/kg) were started. Platelet counts slightly improved (from 10 to15×10/uL) and the patient was discharged with outpatient weekly rituximab treatment (along with steroids). Rituximab was given in a total of 3 cycles； nevertheless， the patient vis-ited the ED 2 times while on rituximab treatment，with severe persistent thrombocytopenia and petechiae on the left arm.In the ED， platelet transfusion， IIG， and l iron were given. The patient was upset about the ineffectiveness of the treatment and refused to be admitted.\n\n【52】Eltrombopag was started (initially 50 mg daily， subsequently increased to TID dosing)， and 2 more doses of IVIG were ad-ministered. His platelet count remained at 4x10/uL.\n\n【53】Because there were no significant bleeding episodes reported that would explain the complete absence of stainable iron on bone marrow biopsy， an iron deficiency work-up was performed. The patient was found to have a high celiac disease (CD) anti-body panel result： elevated titers of tTG-IgA (>100 U/mL) and endomysial IGA levels (1：80). When specifically asked， the pa-tient stated he ate a gluten-free diet because the ingestion of gluten-containing products was generally resulting in abdom-inal pain and diarrhea.\n\n【54】Capsule endoscopy was preferred over the EGD (given the patient's low platelet count)， and the findings were consis-tent with CD . Genetic testing for HLA-DQ2 or DQ8haplotypes was not obtained because this test is useful only in ruling out CD (negative predictive value of >99%， positive predictive value of 12%). The confirmatory criterion standard diagnostic test would be a duodenal biopsy； however， it was not done because of the high risk of bleeding in a patient with persistently low platelet counts.\n\n【55】The diagnosis of CD was based on： 1) Positive CD-related an-tibodies； 2) The original resolution of Gl symptoms with the gluten-free diet； 3) Villous atrophy observed macroscopical-ly on the endoscopy.\n\n【56】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3. Capsule endoscopy： absence of the villi in duodenum and proximal jejunum； Villous blunting in the proximal jejunum.

However， there was no improvement in platelet count. He received plasmapher-esis to remove CD-related antibodies and potentate the re-sponse to anti-ITP medications： 3 L of plasma was successfully\n\n【59】exchanged， with 2 L of albumin 5% and 1 L of FFP. Azathioprine50 mg BID and eltrombopag 50 mg TID regimen was contin-ued and ITP treatment options were re-challenged. However， the platelet count remained below 10x10/uL Although CD-specific antibody titer was decreasing ， ITP remained resistant to treatment.\n\n【60】Fostamatinib (100 mg BID) was started as a last resort before performing a splenectomy.

Ruling out acute coronary syn-drome is essential in ensuring patient safety. Workup includes electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac biomarkers. Wellens syndrome is characterized by a history of chest pain， normal or minimally elevated biomarkers， no STEMI/Q-waves， and specific ECG changes. These changes consist of biphasic T waves in lead V2 and V3 or deep symmetrically inverted T waves in leads V1-V4.\n\n【20】Case Report： A 55-year-old male presented to the emergency department with acute chest pain in a background of active smoking， hypertension， and hyperlipidemia. His ECG was characteristic of Wellens syndrome type 1 and neg-ative cardiac biomarkers. His TIMI (thrombolysis in myocardial infarction) score was 2， however， he failed con-servative management necessitating urgent coronary angiogram. Critical stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery was found which required 2 drug eluting stents. He was discharged home asymptomatic on optimal medical therapy.\n\n【21】Conclusions： Conventional management of patients with NSTEMI (non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction) and unstable an-gina with risk stratification utilizing TIMI score may not be appropriate in patient with Wellens syndrome. This highlights the importance of ECG recognition and urgent percutaneous intervention in patients with Wellens syndrome. Failure to identify this clinical syndrome could result in significant morbidity and mortality because it relates to critical stenosis and imminent large myocardial infarction.\n\n【22】MeSH Keywords： Acute Coronary Syndrome· Electrocardiography· Percutaneous Coronary Intervention\n\n【23】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/912056\n\n【24】Department of Intemal Medicine， Univers ity of South Florida/HCA West Florida Division Blake Medical Center Bradenton， FL U.S.A.\n\n【25】Acute chest pain accounts for 10% of all emergency depart-ment visits. Acute chest pain raises the concern of possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS). After thorough workup only10-15% of patients have the diagnosis of ACS. Diagnosis of ACS can be missed in 2% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is important for all physicians to be aware of subtle presentation of ACS such as Wellens syndrome. When it was first described Wellens syn-drome was thought to represent 14-18% of cases of unstable angina 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Wellens syndrome consists of 2 types of charac-teristic electrocardiographic (ECG) findings. Type 1 accounts for 24% and consists of biphasic T waves most commonly in lead V2 and V3， but can involve leads V1-V5/V6. Type 2 is more common and is identified by deep， symmetrically in-verted T waves in leads V1-V4 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. This is accompanied by a history of anginal chest pain， normal or minimally elevated cardiac biomarkers， absence of Q-waves/STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) and normal R wave progression. Wellens syndrome is a pre-infarction stage of coronary artery disease because it is associated with critical proximal left anterior de-scending (LAD) coronary artery stenosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Early recognition is important because it can lead to a massive anterior wall myocardial infarction.\n\n【26】Case Report\n\n【27】A previously asymptomatic 55-year-old male presented with acute chest pain in a background significant for active smoking， hypertension， and hyperlipidemia. There was no known coro-nary artery disease or relevant surgical， family， or allergy his-tory. His medications included atorvastatin 10 mg and lisin-opril 10 mg daily.\n\n【28】He awoke with sudden onset of crushing central chest pain with 8 out of 10 severity. The pain initially lasted 10 minutes but then became intermittent in nature. He denied any ag-gravating or relieving factors but did endorse associated di-aphoresis. He specifically denied any palpitations，shortness\n\n【29】of breath， nausea， or any other symptoms. After about half an hour he decided to present to the emergency department.\n\n【30】He arrived at the emergency department and an ECG was per-formed in triage while he was asymptomatic and was signifi-cant for biphasic T waves in V2-V4 . Out of concern for the possibility of Wellens syndrome versus typical unsta-ble angina he was treated with loading doses of dual anti-platelets (DAP) aspirin 325 mg and clopidogrel 300 mg， hep-arin (LMWH) 1 mg/kg， sublingual nitroglycerin tablet 0.6 mg， and oral metoprolol 25 mg twice daily. We continued his lisin-opril and increased the dose of atorvastatin (80 mg/day) as he had clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Chest x-rav. complete blood count， d-dimer， and comprehensive metabolic panel were all unremarkable. Troponin I at 1， 4， and 7 hours after initial acute chest pain were all normal with no upward trend. Cholesterol (low-density lipoproteins. 96 mg/dL) and gly-cosylated hemoglobin (5.5%) were unremarkable.\n\n【31】Over the first day of admission， the cardiology service was consulted and recommended medical management because his thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) score was 2. Echocardiogram revealed a mildly depressed ejection fraction at 45% with no regional wall abnormalities. He was， however， still experiencing chest pain that was responsive to adminis-tration of sublingual nitroglycerin tablet. The ECG remained unchanged and his cardiac biomarkers negative.\n\n【32】Over the next 2 days， in spite of optimizing medical therapy， the patient remained symptomatic with central chest pain at rest. On day 3， in light of ongoing symptoms， the decision was made to undergo coronary angiogram (CAG). A high grade 90%LAD artery lesion proximal to the first septal and 70% stenosis of the mid LAD artery were noted . Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was undertaken with 2 drug eluting stents (DES) placed across the proximal lesion and one DES to the mid LAD artery with good angiographic result . After intervention， there was symptomatic improvement with no further episodes of chest pain. He was discharged home to establish care with a cardiologist and to continue aspirin 75 mg\n\n【33】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2.

Angiogram post placement of 2 drug eluting stents.</u>\n\n【37】Discussion\n\n【38】In evaluating chest pain， the history， physical examination， ECG， and cardiac biomarkers are essential to identify patients with ACS. Patients without typical chest pain， positive biomarkers， or ECG evidence of ischemia are considered low risk for ACS. These patients are referred for outpatient stress test within 72hours of discharge. Identification of ECG changes in Wellens syndrome is important because patients may be asymptom-atic， and the majority of these patients have negative cardiac biomarkers (88%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Cardiac stress testing is contraindicated as it may precipitate myocardial infarction.\n\n【39】The Wellens syndrome pattern ECG changes are thought to be highly characteristic for proximal LAD artery stenosis. Critical stenosis of the proximal LAD artery results in a cycle of oc-clusion and reperfusion. This is thought to be the etiology of biphasic T waves in the anterior leads 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. It is important to iden-tify this characteristic ECG in low-risk patients as this would re-stratify these individuals to a high-risk group and avoid unnec-essary delays in CAG and percutaneous coronary intervention.\n\n【40】Re-stratifying low-risk patients in to high risk by identifying the Wellens syndrome pattern on ECG is presented in the lit-erature. One such case involved a 24-year-old female who was deemed to be at low risk for ACS and the failure to recognize a Wellens syndrome pattern ECG resulted in her being dis-charged from the emergency department. She unfortunately\n\n【41】represented with NSTEMI (non-ST-elevation myocardial infarc-tion) one week later 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【42】Wellens syndrome requires urgent percutaneous coronary in-tervention rather than medical management alone. Patients with Wellens syndrome who do not undergo percutaneous cor-onary intervention can go on to develop extensive anterior wall myocardial infarction within 8.5 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Echocardiography should be obtained because it can provide risk stratification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Failure to identify this clinical syndrome could result in signifi-cant morbidity and mortality because it relates to critical ste-nosis and imminent large myocardial infarction.\n\n【43】References：\n\n【44】1\\.

Homozygous sickle cell patients are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality from malaria. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) secondary to， or in the setting of， malarial infection is rare. In our case， the concurrence of Plasmodium falciparum malarial parasitemia and AIHA led to severe hemolytic anemia with an extensive packed red blood cell transfusion requirement. The patient's un-derlying SCD also contributed to the severity of the anemia and persistence of the malarial infection.\n\n【20】Case Report： We report the case of a 29-year-old woman in the second trimester of pregnancy， with a history of SCD， who presented with severe anemia beyond her typical baseline in the setting of P. fatciparum malaria. Hemolysis markers， including lactate dehydrogenase and bilirubin， were elevated. Direct Coombs testing was positive for IgG and C3 antibodies. Treatment with antimalarial agents and steroids led to clinical improvement and even-tual clearance of the parasitemia.\n\n【21】Conclusions： Our patient's clinical course was most compatible with P. falciparum malaria-induced AIHA. Although she re-ceived a short course of steroids， it was treatment and clearance of the parasitemia that led to resolution of the hemolysis and a return to baseline hemoglobin levels. While the exact mechanism of AlHA in malaria is not well characterized， several unique mechanisms have been proposed and should be considered in cases of P. falciparum malaria manifesting with particularly severe hemolytic anemia.\n\n【22】Keywords： Anemia， Hemolytic， Autoimmune · Anemia， Sickle Cell·Malaria\n\n【23】Full-text PDE https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/938854\n\n【24】口1318 H 1 40\n\n【25】Publisher's note： All daims expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of their affiliated\n\n【26】AP\n\n【27】organizations， or those of the publisher the editors and the reviewers.

SCD is most common in sub-Saharan Africa， although it affects approximately 100，000 Americans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. Plasmodium falciparum malaria can present with a broad spec-trum of clinical conditions including severe anemia and cerebral malaria. More than 20 polymorphisms，including sickle cell trait， have been selected in human populations as they offer protec-tion against fatal P. falciparum infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. We present the case of a 29-year-old woman in the second trimester of pregnancy， with a history of SCD， who presented with severe anemia be-yond her typical baseline in the setting of P. falciparum malaria. Hemolysis markers including lactate dehydrogenase and biliru-bin were raised. Direct Coombs testing was positive for lgG and C3 antibodies. The concurrence of P. falciparum malarial para-sitemia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) on a back-ground of SCD led to severe hemolytic anemia with an exten-sive packed red blood cell transfusion requirement. Treatment with antimalarial agents and steroids led to clinical improve-ment and eventual clearance of the parasitemia.\n\n【29】Case Report\n\n【30】A 29-year-old woman in the second trimester of pregnan-cy， with a history of SCD (HbSS genotype)， presented with\n\n【31】severe anemia. Three months prior to presentation she had traveled to Mali and Senegal， where she was diagnosed with P. falciparum malaria and started on an unknown antimalar-ial. However， according to her own report， she was not fully compliant with her prescribed course of treatment. The pa tient did not report any sickle cell vaso-occlusive episodes af-ter she was diagnosed with P. falciparum malaria.\n\n【32】During an outpatient visit at our institution to follow up on her pregnancy， she was found to have severe anemia beyond her typical baseline. She was therefore referred for inpatient admission.\n\n【33】Upon presentation， she was tachycardic， though well-ap-pearing and in no distress. She was anemic to a hemoglobin(Hgb) level of 4.6 g/dL (from her typical baseline of 8-9 g/dL). Reticulocyte percentage was 21.8% (from her typical baseline of 7-8%). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 734 U/L (from her typical baseline of approximately 300 U/L). Total bilirubin was4.6 mg/dL (from hertypical baseline of 1.5 mg/dL). Haptoglobin was undetectable. Direct Coombs testing was positive for IgG and C3. A peripheral blood smear demonstrated P. falciparum in 1% of her red blood cells  and blood parasite cul-ture was positive for P. falciparum. She was transfused with 4units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and admitted for man-agement of malarial parasitemia and concurrent AIHA.\n\n【34】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1. Peripheral blood smear demonstrating Plasmodium fatciparum parasite morphology. Peripheral blood smear on presentation demonstrated P. fatciparum in 1% of red blood cells .</u>\n\n【35】For treatment of malaria， she was started on intravenous arte-sunate 2.4 mg/kg every 12 hours. Following 3 doses of intra-venous artesunate，2 consecutive blood parasite cultures and2 peripheral smears were negative for P. falciparum. She was then transitioned to quinine 648 mg every 8 hours for 24 hours(3 doses total)， and clindamycin 450 mg every 8 hours for 7days. For the management of concurrent AIHA， she was start-ed on intravenous methylprednisolone 500 mg daily for 2 days and thereafter transitioned to prednisone 1 mg/kg/day (equiv-alent to prednisone 60 mg daily) which she received for 2 days while hospitalized. Laboratory markers of hemolysis (LDH and bilirubin) down-trended and hemoglobin stabilized with no fur-ther transfusion requirement. She was thereafter discharged on prednisone 60 mg daily for 7 days (she was also complet-ing her course of clindamycin at the time of discharge). She was scheduled for followup 1 week after discharge.\n\n【36】One week following discharge， repeat thick and thin smears sent in the outpatient setting demonstrated recurrent P. fal-ciparum parasitemia (to<1%). She was readmitted for refrac-tory malaria and started on artemether/lumefantrine 80-480mg for 6 doses (every 8 hours for the first 2 doses， followed by every 12 hours for the following 4 doses). She thereafter again cleared her parasitemia. During this second hospitaliza-tion， her hemoglobin and hemolysis markers remained stable at or near her baseline levels. Prednisone was discontinued with no evidence of recurrent AlHA. Prior to discharge， she had 2 blood parasite cultures and 2 peripheral smears that were negative for P. falciparum. Parasitemia and AIHA did not reoccur during followup after this second hospital discharge.\n\n【37】Discussion\n\n【38】The geographic distribution of SCD mirrors that of malaria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>. This corresponding epidemiological distribution is not coinci-dental， as there is evidence that heterozygotes for the sickle cell gene (HbAS genotype)， also known as sickle cell trait， are protected against mortality from malaria. Sickle cell trait con-fers a high degree of resistance to complicated and severe ma-larial infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-10\\]</u>. The invasion and development stages of P. falciparum are reduced secondary to the unique physi-cal and biochemical properties of the red blood cells (RBCs) in patients with sickle cell trait 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，12\\]</u>. Furthermore， RBCs in patients with sickle cell trait that are parasitized by P. falci-parum have a high propensity to sickle and undergo deforma-tion due to low oxygen tension caused by the parasite. These infected cells become vulnerable to phagocytosis and under-go destruction by the spleen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，13\\]</u>.\n\n【39】In contrast， patients who are homozygous for the sickle cell gene (HbSS genotype) experience increased susceptibility to severe and complicated infections and are at increased\n\n【40】risk of morbidity and mortality from malaria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14-16\\]</u>. P. falci-parum-induced destruction of parasitized RBCs precipitates a severe exacerbation of the pre-existing chronic hemolyt-ic anemia in these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17，18\\]</u>. Malarial infection can also trigger painful vaso-occlusive episodes in sickle cell pa-tients and is a leading cause of hospitalizations in endemic regions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，19\\]</u>. Furthermore， patients with SCD often have impaired splenic function， frequently to the extent of func-tional asplenia due to vaso-occlusive disease-related auto-splenectomy， rendering them incapable of clearing the para-sitized erythrocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【41】There are 5 cases in the literature describing an association between SCD and AIHA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. However， AlHA related to SCD is not the likely cause of our patient's severe anemia at presen-tation. Anemia is frequently associated with malaria secondary to destruction of RBCs by the Plasmodium parasites，splenic sequestration of RBCs， production of inflammatory cytokines， dyserythropoiesis related to infection， and bone marrow sup-pression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. AIHA secondary to， or in the setting of， malari-al infection is rare. While 9 cases in the literature describe an association between malaria and AIHA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23-29\\]</u>， there is only1 case of P.falciparum malaria mimicking AIHA in pregnan-cy that resolved following treatment with antimalarial agents alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. Lastly， the risk of delayed hemolytic anemia after antimalarial treatment， specifically intravenous artesunate， is well documented but we do not believe that this was the like-ly cause for our patient's presentation since it did not reoccur with treatment at our institution 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30-37\\]</u>.\n\n【42】In our case， the concurrence of P. falciparum malarial parasit-emia and AIHA led to severe hemolytic anemia with an exten-sive PRBC transfusion requirement. The patient’s underlying SCD also contributed to the severity of the anemia and persis-tence of the malarial infection. Although she received a short course of steroids， it was treatment and clearance of the par-asitemia that led to resolution of the hemolysis and a return to baseline hemoglobin levels.\n\n【43】Conclusions\n\n【44】While it is difficult to definitively establish that this patient's AlHA resulted from her malarial infection， this relationship ap-pears likely since treatment of the malaria led to resolution of the AIHA. Several unique mechanisms for AIHA in patients with malaria have been proposed. For example， alterations in the levels of antibody-and complement-binding in the setting of Plasmodium infection may play a role， as may reduction in the threshold for splenic sequestration of RBCs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38-40\\]</u>.Although the exact mechanism of AIHA in malaria is not well charac-terized， it should be considered in cases of P. falciparum ma-laria manifesting with particularly severe hemolytic anemia.\n\n【45】Department and Institution Where Work Was Done\n\n【46】Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology， Department of Medicine， Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai， New York City， NY， USA.\n\n【47】References：\n\n【48】1\\.

COVID-19 was then known to spread from China to other parts of the world rapidly. Travel-related transmissions， especially via cruise ships， were identified in many countries， including Indonesia. Bali is a major Indonesian tourist destination with its first case of COVID-19， who was a cruise ship worker and classified as an imported case. Case report： A 23-year-old Balinese male cruise ship worker visited Europe 2 weeks prior to hospital admission. He came with shortness of breath， sore throat， dry cough， fatigue for 3 days and fever for 9 days. Physical examination revealed fever with normal blood pressure， pulse rate， and respiratory rate. Blood saturation (SpO2) of 98% with oxygen nasal cannula 2 L/min. The rapid screening test for COVID-19 was reactive and confirmed by nasopharyngeal swabs rRT-PCR. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral perihilar and pericardial haziness. He was subsequently given empirical antibiotics with azithromycin， chloroquine， oseltamivir， vitamin C and antitussive agents. He was discharged with good recovery on the21st day after two consecutive negative swab examination results. Conclusion： In our case， we highlighted cruise-ship workers as a vulnerable population in COVID-19 transmission. Travel history information is important for the clinician to identify or suspect COVID-19 cases.\n\n【5】KEYWORDS COVID-19， Cruise Ship Worker， First case， Transmission\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】World Health Organization (WHO) announced an outbreak of respiratory illness in late December 2019 caused by SARS-CoV-2， later officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Here we present the first case of COVID-19 in the Badung regency of Bali， Indonesia.\n\n【18】Case report\n\n【19】On March 25， 2020， a 23-year-old male Balinese cruise ship worker was transferred to Udayana University Hospital as a patient suspected of COVID-19. The chief complaint includes shortness of breath， sore throat， dry cough， fatigue for 3 days， and fever for 9 days. His condition was getting worse during hospitalization. Initial physical examination revealed a body temperature of 37.9℃， blood pressure of 110/70 mm Hg， a pulse of 88 bpm， respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min， and SpO2 of 98%\n\n【20】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3： Thorax CT scan revealed no infiltrate nor subpleural ground-glass opacity on both lung fields.</u>\n\n【21】with nasal cannula 2 L/min. The breathing sound was initially normal. Further laboratory examination showed lymphope-nia (531 cells/ul)， elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase(AST， 78 U/L)， normal levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT，41 U/L)， C-reactive protein within the normal limit (CRP，7.8mg/L)， and mildly elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH， 295U/L). Serology test for COVID-19 was reactive and confirmed positive by Real-Time Reverse-Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 from his nasopharyngeal swab. The chest X-ray revealed bilateral perihilar and pericardial infiltration and haziness .\n\n【22】He worked at a cruise ship as a waiter， but he did not wear a mask or facial protection during his work even though he was aware of this pandemic. His cruise ship had sailed through France， Malta， and Italy， before arriving at Barcelona on March12， 2020， as its final destination. He spent a day in Barcelona sightseeing at a market near the harbour with his friends before flying back to Bali via Qatar .\n\n【23】The patient was then given empirical antibiotics such as azithromycin， chloroquine， oseltamivir， vitamin C， and anti-tussive agents on his first day of hospitalization. We added chloroquine and antiviral agents on day 2 based on the standard of care of our hospital after the positive rRT-PCR result. The test was then repeated on day seven， showing a negative result. However， on day 10， the test came out positive. Before getting discharged， his nasopharyngeal swabs on days 19 and 21 were negative， respectively. The patient's clinical condition soon im-proved， and he was discharged 21 days following his admission(April 15，2020).\n\n【24】Serial chest X-ray examination was done and its revealed remission in both lung field  that we confirmed these findings with thoracic CT scan .\n\n【25】Discussion\n\n【26】Clinical manifestation of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic， mild， moderate， to severe， with main symptoms of fever， cough， shortness of breath and fatigue. The mild-moderate form may be atypical in the early course of COVID-19 that indistinguish-able from many other common infectious diseases.9 In more severe cases， infections caused viral pneumonia and could lead to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and even death.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> The worsening inflammatory-induced lung injury will create a decrease in oxygen saturation (<93%). From this point on， that there may be a rapid deterioration of respiratory functions.11\\]\n\n【27】According to the Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline for SARS-CoV-2 issued by the Chinese National Health Commit-tee， this patient is categorized as a moderate-levelled case of pneumonia COVID-19.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> The transmission of COVID-19 was thought to solely occur from animal to humans通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> in Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market of Wuhan，\\[11J only to finally know that as this pandemic progressed，human-to-human transmis-sion is also taking place through respiratory droplets通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> and direct contact.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> Parametric analysis shows that the growth rate of COVID-19 is about twice that of the SARS and MERS.The COVID-19 doubling cycle is two to three days， suggesting that the number of COVID-19 patients would double in two to three days without human intervention.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> Frequent overcrowding in a confined environment such as on a cruise ship may increase the risk for infection. Ships provide an isolated， crowded envi-ronment with poor ventilation that may increase the passenger's risk of infection if exposed to respiratory viruses.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>\n\n【28】The mean of the incubation period for COVID-19 is 6 days， varying from 2-11 (95% CI) days通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. This may explain the transmission time in our case， i.e. probably happened while he was at the ship or during embarking in Barcelona.\n\n【29】There are four stages of COVID-19 radiology findings： Early-stage on day 0-4， progressive stage on day 5-8， peak stage Udyon day9-14， and finally absorption stage on >14 days， correlated with clinical course.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> Radiology findings were also affected by the disease severity. In mild cases，x-ray findings could be normal or only shows minimal patchy infiltration on the lung field. This correlates to our patient's x-ray finding on day 6， with only minimal haziness on the bilateral perihilar region. Even though several studies had already reported the sensitivity finding of chest CT scan to evaluate the typical radiographic features in most COVID-19 patients， we did not perform a chest CT scan examination immediately after admission because we are trying to reduce the mobility of the patient in our hospital to lower the risk of transmission to our medical staffs. Instead， after the patient recovers and his rRT-PCR result proves him negative of COVID-19， we did a CT evaluation to ensure any abnormal sequel presence on the patient lung. It then showed up as a CT result of a normal lung.\n\n【30】The gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection is conducted through rRT-PCR assays from nasal and oropharyngeal swabs. Though results from RT-quantitative PCR could be affected by variations in viral RNA sequences or viral loads in different anatomic sites during the disease’s natural course， an estimate shows false-negative rates (FNRs) from one-time testing would occur in 30% to 50% cases of real COVID-19.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>\n\n【31】There are several comorbidities such as hypertension， dia-betes mellitus， and cardiac diseases that can increase the severity of COVID-19 symptoms.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18，19\\]</u> In addition， immunosuppres-sive conditions because of chronic fatigue， alcohol consumption， and sleep problems might be a risk factor in our case. Further studies indicate that detectable SARS-CoV-2 in the blood is a strong indicator for further clinical severity (p-value=0.0001) and may even replicate in the digestive tract.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>\n\n【32】There is no specific treatment for COVID-19， although dif-ferent experimental treatments with antiviral drugs (lopinavir/ritonavir； remdesivir) and interferon are being used.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u> There-fore， we recommend administering hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)(or chloroquine/ QC) on a case-by-case basis for patients with COVID-19 with evidence for pneumonia because of the in vitro activity of HCQ/QC against SARS-CoV-2， with hydroxychloro-quine being more potent than the latter. Chloroquine had been reported to be superior in preventing pneumonia， improving lung imaging findings， hastening conversion to a virus-negative state， and shortening the duration of disease.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> Adverse ef-fects profiles of HCQ/QC are well established， too. Therefore， patients could be monitored for predictable adverse effects with routine tests.\n\n【33】Quarantine， physical distancing， and early detection with the rapid diagnostic assay of cruise ship workers could help nt：prevent and control the spreading of covid-19 infection from these workers. Because little is known about its transmission method， it is well recommended to take precautions if SARS-CoV-2 may transmit by airborne measures.\n\n【34】Conclusion\n\n【35】Early diagnosis of COVID-19 is important for the clinician that allows early patient's isolation， ensuing laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2， and appropriate further management. This case\n\n【36】report emphasizes the importance of recognizing and tracing a patient's travel history and possible exposure to infected contacts in order to do an early identification and isolation of patients at risk of high-risk transmittable disease.\n\n【37】Funding\n\n【38】This work did not receive any grant from funding agencies in the public， commercial， or not-for-profit sectors.\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of interest</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There are no conflicts of interest to declare by any of the authors of this study.</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>References</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

Causes include vascular or lymphatic spread or iat-rogenic mechanisms following surgery. A sub-type of this disease process， “Carcinoma Erysipeloides，” repre-sents subcutaneous and dermal tissue layer invasion via lymphatic spread. Diagnosis can be challenging， and therefore， obtaining a thorough history and physical， with careful inspection of prior surgical scars is essential for an accurate diagnosis. Lesions present in variable ways， including papules， plaques， ulcerations， nodules， crusting， or fungating masses， with common locations in the chest， scalp， abdomen， and less commonly the arms. When carcinoma erysipeloides is identified， it is imperative to evaluate for distant metastases. Recent lit-erature has identified benefits with trastuzumab deruxtecan therapy instead of trastuzumab emtansine， with decreased progression rates and decreased mortality rates. Metastasis to the skin can indicate advanced dis-ease； however， this metastatic site may be preferable to visceral organs or bones in terms of prognosis.\n\n【24】Case Report： We present a rare manifestation of metastatic breast cancer in 45-year-old Hispanic woman， status post neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and radical cystectomy on maintenance trastuzumab and pertuzumab. We discuss the clinical presentation variability， keys to diagnosis， treatment considerations， and outcomes for this unique pa-tient population.\n\n【25】Conclusions： Carcinoma erysipeloides varies in clinical presentation， especially when patients develop exclusive skin lesions. We identify common etiologies for this progression of disease and discuss combination therapy which has dem-onstrated a reduction in mortality in this patient population.\n\n【26】Keywords： Breast Neoplasms · Inflammatory Breast Neoplasms · Trastuzumab Deruxtecan\n\n【27】Ful-text PDE https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/937843\n\n【28】口1332 盟 山2 非4\n\n【29】Publisher's note： All daims expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of their affiliated\n\n【30】AP\n\n【31】organizations， or those of the publisher the editors and the reviewers.

Here， we present a rare case of a young woman who developed skin le-sions appearing as a benign rash， found to be biopsy-proven recurrent inflammatory breast carcinoma， which was subse-quently treated with trastuzumab and deruxtecan.\n\n【33】Case Report\n\n【34】A 45-year-old Hispanic woman with a past medical history of stage Illc left inflammatory breast cancer with ER/PR negativ-ity and HER-2/Neu positivity presented to the Hematology-Oncology clinic for routine follow-up. In terms of her cancer history， she had biopsy-positive ductal adenocarcinoma with ER/PR negativity and HER2 positivity with Ki67 of <10%. The patient previously underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with docetaxel， carboplatin， trastuzumab，and pertuzumab (TCHP) followed by a left-modified radical mastectomy， in which her post-mastectomy cancer staging was ypTis (DCIS) NO (i+) Mx. She underwent 2 weeks of radiation therapy. Her postopera-tive course was complicated by the development of recurrent seroma without evidence of infection， in addition to chemo port-related thrombosis with subsequent port removal. Since then， the patient has received maintenance therapy with trastu-zumab and pertuzumab.\n\n【35】The patient presented with a rash on the upper aspect of her abdominal wall， localized under her left inframammary fold a few weeks after completion of radiation therapy and 5 months after surgery . At the time， the patient noted painful， burning， mildly pruritic， swollen， non-bleeding， and erythem-atous rash. She denied subjective fevers， chills， unintention-al weight loss， appetite loss， or dizziness. She was referred to Dermatology and was treated with topical steroids， which pro-vided initial relief. Her symptoms later worsened and the rash progressed across her abdomen. Given the steroid-refractory rash， the patient underwent a biopsy of her rash， demonstrat-ing atypical cells that were immunohistochemically positive for CK7， GATA-3， and Her2/neu and negative for ER， findings con-sistent with the patient's clinical history of metastatic ductal adenocarcinoma . PET-CT imaging was negative for\n\n【36】additional metastatic disease. Given this incredibly rare pre-sentation， the patient consented to chemotherapy treatment with trastuzumab and deruxtecan.She has remained clinical-ly stable with mild fatigue following infusions on this therapy regimen， with initial follow-up PET-CT scan to assess response scheduled for 3 months from initiation of therapy. The patient was additionally referred for potential clinical trials if this ther-apy is deemed unsuccessful in the future.\n\n【37】Discussion\n\n【38】The etiology of skin metastases from breast cancer may be multifactorial， either via direct spread through vascular or lym-phatic distribution， or iatrogenic in the setting of surgical in-tervention (such as mastectomy or lumpectomy) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The most common manifestation of breast cancer skin metastases oc-curs with，“Carcinoma Erysipeloides\" which presents primarily with inflammatory breast cancer patients， and manifests in the subcutaneous and dermal tissue layers via lymphatic channel spread 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Approximately 1 year after a radical mastectomy， our patient presented with cutaneous manifestations of the disease. Given her history of inflammatory breast carcinoma and biopsy-proven dermal lymphatic metastases， our patient’s pathophysiology is consistent with carcinoma erysipeloides.\n\n【39】Cutaneous metastatic breast cancer has a variable presenta-tion and may present as flesh-colored or erythematous， ulcer-ated or smooth papules， plaques， or nodules with or without crusting， and can develop into substantial fungating mass-es 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Metastases develop most commonly on the abdomen， the chest， and the scalp， with less common manifestations on the arms， lower abdomen， back， nail beds， or umbilicus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Patients may develop symptoms including but not limited to pruritus， erythema， pain or stinging at the lesion site， hard-ened skin， or a warm sensation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Carcinoma erysipeloides may initially be misdiagnosed as a rash given its presentation with erythematous，elevated，tender lesions that are warm to touch and may have a leading edge 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. An important manifes-tation to note is metastatic skin lesion development that can occur either at previous surgical sites or at port sites； there-fore， inspection of the surgical scars is essential when exam-ining the patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Given our patient’s history of inflam-matory breast cancer and new-onset rash， a skin biopsy was obtained to further investigate the spread of the disease. Her case was unique， as she developed metastatic disease exclu-sively to the skin， with PET-CT findings negative for addition-al evidence of metastatic disease.\n\n【40】Presence of cutaneous lesions may be an indicator of distant metastases； therefore， evaluation for distant metastasis may need to be completed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Once distant metastatic disease has been ruled out， local therapy may be considered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Although\n\n【41】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1. Abdominal wall rash . Two patches of lesions， one in the left inframammary fold that goes past midline and near recent laparoscopic cholecystectomy lesion， with another patch in the left upper and left lower quadrants approximately5x5 cm in size， and slightly raised and non-tender to palpation (A， C， D images demonstrating upper abdominal rash； B image demonstrating left torso rash).</u>\n\n【42】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2. (A， B) Left abdominal skin biopsy demonstrating unremarkable epidermis and markedly distended dermal lymphatic channels containing plugs of markedly atypical cells.</u>\n\n【43】this tends to be less practical given the nature of cutaneous disease to spread multifocally and given the likely history of prior surgeries such as mastectomy， local therapy may include surgical excision of the cutaneous lesion(s) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Additionally， radiation therapy (RT) may be considered； however， studies have not demonstrated curative outcomes， and this would be more of a palliative approach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In addition， inflammato-ry breast cancer has not demonstrated adequate responses to localized therapy thus far 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【44】Treatment recommendations for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer include trastuzumab emtansine if pa-tients have progressed following combination therapy with a taxane and anti-HER2 antibody 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. However， a recent study concluded that in this patient population， patients treated with trastuzumab deruxtecan combination therapy demon-strated lower disease progression and mortality rates when compared to trastuzumab emtansine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Given this informa-tion， our patient consented to trastuzumab deruxtecan che-motherapy. For breast cancer patients who develop metastat-ic disease， the typical treatment is chemotherapy indefinitely； however， given our patient’s unique case， if her skin lesions regress there is a consideration for discontinuing chemother-apy given no further metastatic organ involvement.\n\n【45】The presence of cutaneous metastases from breast malignan-cy may indicate advanced disease and a less favorable prog-nosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. While patients with breast malignancies have a bet-ter prognosis than those with other cancers， the estimated mean survival rate after a diagnosis of cutaneous metastasis is 50% at 6 months. Therefore， a multidisciplinary evaluation is important for quick initiation of treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Cutaneous metastases pose a significant risk of infection， as malignant wounds have difficulty healing. Adequate wound care contrib-utes to an improvement in overall quality of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Metastasis\n\n【46】to soft tissue is associated with a better prognosis than to a visceral organ or bone； therefore， if metastases are confined to the skin， patients can be maintained on a treatment regi-men for several years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【47】Conclusions\n\n【48】In summary， cutaneous metastatic breast cancer remains rare and variable in clinical presentation， especially with exclu-sive metastatic disease to the skin organ. Here， we identified common pathophysiologic mechanisms for the development of this disease process， things to consider when suspecting this disease， as well as management considerations based on current literature and guidelines. Our patient ultimately was found to have isolated skin metastases and consented to treat-ment with trastuzumab deruxtecan. Given the absence of fur-ther metastasis on PET-CT imaging， she may be a candidate for discontinuation of chemotherapy pending resolution of her skin lesions. Ultimately， additional research is warranted for this unique patient population to further improve upon accu-rate clinical diagnoses and appropriate therapeutic regimens.\n\n【49】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【50】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to thank the patient and her fami-ly for allowing us to share this case with our colleagues.

The provider requested a medication safety review， where the clinical pharmacist-recommended PGx testing given the LLE pain and weakness while taking a statin and inconsistent INR readings taking warfarin. The pharma-cist recommended switching atorvastatin to pravastatin to minimize the risk for statin-associated ADEs due to CYP3A4 inhibition and switching fluoxetine to citalopram due to uncontrolled depression/anxiety and to mit-igate drug-drug interactions with carvedilol to reduce the risk of orthostatic hypotension. Recommendations were accepted and upon follow-up the patient reported minor LLE pain and improved wellbeing on citalopram. Following PGx testing， the patient had decreased function at SLCO1B1 and was an intermediate metabolizer for CYP2C9 and CYP2D6. This case demonstrates how preemptive PGx testing would have identified drug-gene interactions (DGIs) at the time of prescribing and reduced the risk of statin-associated muscular symptoms， highlighting the utility of panel-based PGx testing in older adults at high risk for ADEs and/or therapy failure. Decreased function at SLCO1B1 increases exposure to statins， leading to statin-induced myalgias， as displayed in this case. PGx testing can help identify DGIs， choose optimal therapies in medically complex older adults， and minimize ADE risk.\n\n【30】Keywords： Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions· Hydroxymethy glutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors·Myalgia · Pharmacogenetics\n\n【31】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/938850\n\n【32】￥老 1608 盟3 山可 目可\n\n【33】21\n\n【34】Publisher's note： All daims expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of their affiliated\n\n【35】AP\n\n【36】organizations， or those of the publisher the editors and the reviewers.

The aim of this case report was to perform a pharmacogenetic examination in a 70-year woman with polypharmacy and multiple comorbidities.\n\n【41】Case Report\n\n【42】A 70-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities and medi-cations  enrolled in the Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) on December 1， 2021 (Day 1). Upon en-rollment， the patient presented with left lower extremity (LLE) pain， generalized weakness， and major depressive disorder(MDD). A Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) evaluation suggested mild depression. At enrollment， the patient’s high-density lipoprotein (HDL)， low-density lipoprotein (LDL)， and total cholesterol (TC) were 47， 97， and 176mg/dL， respective-ly. Considering this information， the patient's atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk of 20.3% indicated high-intensity statin therapy despite her reported LLE pain and high risk of statin intolerance due to specific risk factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【43】The patient's care team requested that a medication safety re-view be performed by a clinical pharmacist. Shortly after en-rollment， the clinical pharmacist made 11 recommendations通用删除1(英):<u>(listed in Table 2)</u> to improve the safety and efficacy of the pa-tient's medication regimen； 3 changes were implemented on Day 36.

Secondly， ezetimibe was discontinued to reduce pill burden. Then， atorvastatin 20 mg was changed to pravastatin 40 mg to minimize potential interactions with dilti-azem and warfarin at CYP3A4 and to reduce the risk of contin-ued LLE pain and generalized weakness. An updated medication list following the implementation of these pharmacist-recom-mended medication changes can be found in Table 2.\n\n【53】The patient's “time in therapeutic range\" for warfarin dosing(ie， an international normalization ratio (INR) goal between2.5 and 3.5) was less than 50%， a consistent trend through-out the patient's history with warfarin. Unstable INR readings were observed despite a self-reported adherence to warfarin and consistent diet. At the recommendation of a clinical phar-macist， the clinician ordered a PGx test on Day 87 to optimize the patient's complex medication regimen.\n\n【54】PGx results  revealed decreased function of solute car-rier organic anion transporter family member 1B1 (SLCO1B1)， a transporter protein that facilitates statin entry into hepato-cytes. Utilizing these results and a CDSS (MedWise@)， the PGx pharmacist recommended close monitoring for signs of my-opathy， and decreasing pravastatin to 20 mg， if deemed clini-cally appropriate based on an updated lipid panel.\n\n【55】The cumulative effect of the patient's VKORC1， CYP4F2， and CYP2C9 status was an overall increased warfarin sensitivity通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，13\\]</u>. As warfarin has a stronger affinity for the CYP2C19 en-zyme than citalopram， the pharmacist noted a drug-drug-gene interaction (DDGI) between warfarin and citalopram -warfa-rin-mediated competitive inhibition of co-administered cital-opram increases risk of ADEs. The pharmacist recommended minimizing this risk by separating the time of administration.\n\n【56】Other medication-related recommendations made over the course of care can be found in Table 2.\n\n【57】During follow-up assessments， the patient has reported mi-nor LLE pain primarily occurring at night. Although a second PHQ-9 evaluation was not conducted， patient wellbeing had improved. Eight months after enrollment， HDL， LDL， and total cholesterol were 51， 70， and 134 mg/dL respectively-a 28%LDL reduction and 24% TC reduction.\n\n【58】Although the patient still experiences wide INR ranges， the team closely monitors INR readings and makes appropriate dose adjustments. Diet education has also been provided to the patient to help minimize future INR fluctuations. Eight months after enrollment， the patient's INR is checked every3 to 4 days. The patient's provider reports her INR is more stable following the pharmacist's education on strategies to avoid large INR fluctuations. Within the CDSS， the patient's MedWise@ Risk Score decreased from high risk to moder-ate risk. The patient reported improved mental and physical health since enrollment in PACE and implementation of phar-macist-recommended interventions.\n\n【59】Discussion\n\n【60】This case report offers an example of the full utility of panel-based PGx testing in older adults who are at high risk of ADEs and/or therapy failure. PGx results exposed additional risk fac-tors for statin-induced myopathy that have been linked to in-creased serum statin concentrations and greater likelihood of experiencing myopathy and/or generalized weakness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【61】The patient reported LLE pain， which was attributed to trauma from a motor vehicle accident that occurred years prior to en-rollment. Statin therapy is known to reduce the threshold of experiencing muscle pain. Statin-associated muscular symp-toms (SAMS) risk factors include female gender， age greater than 65 years， hypothyroidism， diabetes， and trauma； this pa-tient presented with all 5 risk factors. Obtaining PGx results prior to prescribing the statin， also known as preemptive PGx testing， would have enabled the healthcare team to identify and minimize the risk of SAMS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，15\\]</u>.\n\n【62】In 2022， the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) updated its statin-SLCO1B1 guideline to emphasize the SAMS risk evidence based on statin therapy in-tensity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In this case， the patient was taking atorvastatin 20mg at time of enrollment. Correlation between dose and SAMS risk can be seen with every statin； however， the highest SAMS risk is associated with atorvastatin， simvastatin， pitavastatin， and lovastatin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. At enrollment， it was determined that maintain-ing moderate-intensity statin therapy was appropriate for our\n\n【63】patient based on her ASCVD risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Per the CPIC guidelines， pravastatin 40 mg was more appropriate than atorvastatin be-cause of its lower risk of SAMS. Although atorvastatin 20 mg is also an appropriate option due to its low SAMS risk， her co-pre-scribed diltiazem and warfarin both have a stronger affinity for the CYP3A4 enzyme than atorvastatin， resulting in DDIs， high-er serum levels of atorvastatin， and， ultimately， elevated atorv-astatin-associated SAMS risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，17\\]</u>. For these reasons， atorv-astatin may have contributed to the development of LLE pain.\n\n【64】Unlike atorvastatin， pravastatin is not extensively metabolized by the CYP system， making pharmacokinetic DDIs significantly less likely， especially in this case and others with SCLO1B1 de-creased function. Evidence suggests that SLCO1B1 decreased function may also decrease the risk-modifying benefits of statin therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18，19\\]</u>. Mechanistically， this may be explained by re-duced SLCO1B1-mediated importation of statins into hepatic cells， where HMG-CoA reductase， the primary enzymatic target of statins， plays a role in cholesterol biosynthesis. The bene-fits of statin dose changes should always be weighed against these increased risks.\n\n【65】A wide range of therapy options exists for patients who do not tolerate statin therapy. These alternatives should be considered on an individual basis due to variable benefit and side effect profiles. Statin alternatives include PCSK9 inhibitors， bempedo-ic acid， fibric acid derivatives， peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha) agonists， niacin， bile acid seques-trants， and ezetimibe 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. These alternatives should be consid-ered if statin therapy alone is no longer sufficient to manage a patient's hyperlipidemia， despite being optimized 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. The rec-ommendation to remove ezetimibe was made prior to PGx test-ing. However， if PGx test results were available at the time of en-rollment， this recommendation would have likely not been made.\n\n【66】References：\n\n【67】1\\. Virani SS， Morris PB， Agarwala A， et al.

However， in this case， the patient had been taking warfarin for more than a decade prior to enrollment. Given the diagnoses of atrial fibrillation and the presence of a mechanical mitral valve， warfarin was deemed the most ap-propriate anticoagulant for this patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. When PGx results are available at the time of warfarin initiation， polymorphisms identified in the VKORC1，CYP4F2， and CYP2C9 genes can guide calculation of initiation doses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Our patient’s polymorphisms in the VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genes could result in increased warfarin sensitivity， while her polymorphism in CYP4F2 could result in decreased warfarin sensitivity. Collectively， these mu-tations make increased sensitivity a more probable outcome. The utility of this data is highest early in therapy； clinicians should consider ordering tests as early as available and， if pos-sible， prior to initiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【83】Conclusions\n\n【84】Decreased function of the SLCO1B1 transporter can increase exposure to statins， leading to statin-induced myalgias， as displayed in this case. PGx can help clinicians choose optimal therapies for medically complex older adults， minimizing the risk of ADEs. Specifically， preemptive panel-based PGx testing supports reduction of the risk of statin-induced myalgia/myop-athies. When starting statin therapy or in the event of SAMs， PGx testing is especially beneficial to help prevent negative outcomes while improving quality of life.\n\n【85】Statement\n\n【86】Patient consent was obtained through informed consent from BRANY IRB Approved Research Protocol #22-12-045-427.\n\n【87】9\\.

BP is an autoimmune process that can be induced， though rarely， by medications. Drug-induced BP often has atypical clinical presentation， which requires a good understanding of other dermatological conditions with similar pre-sentations， in particular， bullous subtype of erythema multiforme. End organ involvement warrants differenti-ating it from one of the severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR) syndromes.\n\n【25】Case Report：\n\n【26】A 76-year-old African American male presented with extensive targetoid purplish skin lesions that clinically re-sembled atypical erythema multiforme， and one tense blister that raised a concem for BP. The patient presented6 weeks after treatment with cephalexin for a urinary tract infection. Initial workup showed serum eosinophilia， acute kidney injury and eosinophiluria requiring deliberations on SCAR syndromes. A skin biopsy at an intrale-sional location showed a negative DIF， however， a skin biopsy at a perilesional site showed a positive DIF， con-firming the diagnosis of BP.\n\n【27】Conclusions：\n\n【28】This case demonstrates an atypical presentation of BPinduced by drugs. It emphasizes the need for a greater level of awareness of diagnosis and treatment of the various entities that fall under adverse drug reactions in the elderly. It also highlights the need for appropriate choice of skin biopsy techniques (intralesional versus perilesional) to avoid misdiagnosis， as well as lessons on how to approach dermatologic conditions with end organ involvement for hospitalists and other medical professionals who routinely deal with undifferentiated disease conditions.\n\n【29】MeSH Keywords：\n\n【30】Drug Hypersensitivity Syndrome·Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions· Erythema Multiforme· Hypereosinophilic Syndrome· Nephritis， Interstitial ·Pemphigoid， Bullous\n\n【31】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/911422\n\n【32】Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune subepidermal blis-tering disease that clinically presents with tense bullae with widespread erythema primarily in the elderly population. It is often idiopathic， but may be associated with malignancy， medications， and rarely， other autoimmune disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Its pathophysiology is mediated by autoantibodies to antigens on hemidesmosomes that attach epithelial cells to underlying basement membrane. Diagnosis is based on direct immuno-fluorescence (DIF) study on skin biopsy samples that confirms the presence of immunoglobulins and complements in the epi-dermal basement membrane zone and other serological tests. Drug-induced BP， however， tends to have an atypical clinical presentation that poses a diagnostic challenge 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， such as was the case for this patient， who required a repeat skin bi-opsy due to our high degree of clinical suspicion.\n\n【33】This patient case peaked our interest for an academic discus-sion because it embodied a unique set of challenges faced by those in medical disciplines who routinely deal with undiffer-entiated disease conditions such as those who practice in in-ternal medicine， family medicine， and emergency medicine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. This is acutely relevant for hospitalists， since most dermato-logic conditions are managed in outpatient settings depriving them of exposure to a wider range of dermatologic conditions. In the inpatient setting， hospitalists are often the ones who will first encounter these cases， diagnose， determine illness severity， and initiate therapy and consultations.\n\n【34】The clinical care in this case was surrounded with dilemmas. The initial therapeutic dilemma was inpatient versus outpatient care， since it was not clear if the presence of just one small ac-tive bullous lesion  on presentation should warrant a higher-level of concern for potentially life-threatening skin disorders. After an inpatient admission， the second diagnostic dilemma was triggered by the presence of multiple potential etiologies on further history and workup， including a positive syphilis serology and patient use of multiple medications. Third， further workup also showed the presence of systemic eosin-ophilia (serum eosinophilia， eosinophiluria， and eosinophilic infiltration of the dermis) with end organ involvement (acute kidney injury)， which raised the question of the role of eosin-ophils either as a primary hematologic disorder with a differ-ent prognosis or a relatively benign secondary marker of an-other etiology.\n\n【35】Case Report\n\n【36】A 76-year-old African American male nursing home resident presented to the emergency department with a diffuse rash and worsening renal function of 3 weeks duration. His past\n\n【37】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1. A single tense blister on the dorsal left hand， with minimal surrounding erythema.</u>\n\n【38】medical history included hypertension， diabetes mellitus type ll， chronic kidney disease stage 2， treated secondary syphilis， and a prior ischemic stroke. The pruritic rash was first noticed on his lower back and gradually spread to his upper and front parts of his trunk and extremities. The rash was reported to include“pockets of fluids” initially， but bulla was only visible only at one location  on presentation. The patient denied any sores or blisters in his mouth. He was treated with cephalexin for 7 days for a urinary tract infection 6 weeks prior to admis-sion. His list of preadmission medications included losartan， metformin， gabapentin， atorvastatin，tolterodine， and aspirin.\n\n【39】On physical examination， the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs. There was a mix of purplish discrete and confluent targetoid macules  and diffuse plaques， which were symmetrically distributed on the trunk， arms， legs，palms， and soles . The distribution spared the face and oral mucous membranes. There was a single tense blister on the dorsal left hand， with minimal surrounding erythema . The targetoid lesions were partially blanching， non-palpable， non-tender， with a darker central area and scaling in some cases， which appears to be a secondary change after the rup-ture of blisters .\n\n【40】Pertinent initial laboratory findings include： total white cell count of 9700 cells/mL with eosinophilia 11.0%， absolute eo-sinophil count (AEC) of 1200 cells/mL)， serum creatinine of2.1 mg/dL (increased from a baseline of 1.3 mg/dl)， and urine Hansel's stain showed presence of 4.3% eosinophils. Serology showed rapid positive plasma reagin (RPR) with 1： 4 titers and a reactive T. pallidum microhemagglutination assay (MHA-TP).\n\n【41】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2.

However， on a perilesional biopsy， stains for C3 and IgG showed linear positivity of the basement membrane zone. DIF stain for fi-brinogen showed nonspecific staining. Stains for IgM， IgA，and C1q were negative.\n\n【52】Hospital course\n\n【53】The patient was started on oral prednisone， topical clobeta-sol (clobetasol propionate 0.05% cream)， and oral diphenhydr-amine. The skin lesions showed clinical improvement after 36hours； however， serum eosinophilia increased from an initial11.0% to 22.4% with an AEC increase from 1200 cells/mL to3423 cells/mL. Treatment with topical and systemic steroids was continued and the patient was discharged improved. On a 10-day post-discharge clinic follow-up visit， there was a sig-nificant improvement in the skin lesions and resolution of eo-sinophilia and acute kidney injury.\n\n【54】Discussion\n\n【55】This discussion， with the benefit of hindsight， outlines a general approach framework and delves deeper into relevant diagnos-tic and treatment topics in a focused literature review format.\n\n【56】Broad differentials\n\n【57】The differential diagnosis for a combination of skin lesions and serum eosinophilia encompasses a wide range of dis-eases， including allergy or hypersensitivity， parasitosis， fun-gal infections， neoplasm or hyperplastic disorders， HIV-related eruptions， cutaneous vasculitis， autoimmune blistering skin disorders， pregnancy-related disorders， pediatric specific dis-orders， and other systemic diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>. The overwhelming majority of eosinophilic dermatoses epidemiologically， how-ever， lie in the allergy related group， which includes allergic drug eruption， urticaria， allergic contact dermatitis， atopic der-matitis， and eczema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>.\n\n【58】Allergic drug eruptions， also referred to as \"drug allergy\"or adverse drug reactions (ADR)， comprise various entities. Thus， reaching at a specific diagnosis required familiarity with the various disease entities and classifications under ADR. Of note. ADR should not be confused with the broader concept of ad-verse drug events (ADE) which， in addition to ADR， includes\n\n【59】other non-pharmacologic events like inappropriate use of drugs and medication administration errors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>.\n\n【60】Dermatologic manifestations of drug allergy\n\n【61】The most common types of ADR are referred to as type-A re-actions and occur directly due to the pharmacologic action of a drug 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. However， most drug-related dermatologic con-ditions， such as in this patient case， are due to ADR and be-long to its type-B subcategory referred to as drug hypersen-sitivity reactions (DHR) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Type B reactions are not related to the known pharmacologic action of the drug. Their under-lying mechanisms are not entirely understood but are often mediated throughimmunologic reactions to an otherwise safe and effective therapeutic agent and are often associated with high mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8，10\\]</u>.\n\n【62】Clinically， DHR are classified as immediate， typically <1 hour following the last intake of the culprit drug， or delayed-type DHR (DTH)， typically >1 hour to days after the start of atreat-ment with the culprit drug 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，11，12\\]</u>. This patient presented2 months after a course of cephalexin， most likely fitting de-layed DHR timeline 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. On the other hand， to correlate clin-ical presentations with underlying immune mechanism， drug hypersensitivity， and other immune reactions are frequently classified into 4 categories described by Coombs and Gell in1963 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. It is important to note that each of the 4 hypersen-sitivity class types have their own dermatologic clinical man-ifestations， although some reports find the classification lim-iting and not comprehensive enough 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13-15\\]</u>.\n\n【63】ADR can virtually affect any organ， but skin， liver， and blood cells are the most common targets通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. The clinical spectrum of ADR dermatologic manifestations ranges from fixed drug eruption (FDE)， maculopapular eruption (MPE)， general exfo-liative dermatitis or erythroderma， drug reaction with eosino-philia， and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome)， acute gen-eralized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP)， Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)， toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)， other bullous reactions mimicking pemphigus vulgaris and bullous pemphi-goid up to vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，12\\]</u>.\n\n【64】One of the first tasks in the management of this patient was ruling out potentially life-threatening ADRs. Among the der-matologic manifestations of ADR， 4 entities with high mortal-ity rate belong to a class referred to as severe cutaneous ad-verse reactions (SCAR)： SJS， TEN， AGEP，and DRESS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Studies show that SJS and TEN， do not usually produce eosinophilia， but rather neutrophilia and lymphocytopenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Furthermore， although AGEP and DRESS present with eosinophilia， AGEP does not typically involve end organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. DRESS syndrome was strongly entertained as a possibility in this patient， as it is characterized by multi-systemic involvement and frequent\n\n【65】eosinophilia. Nonetheless， although this patient had significant eosinophilia， end organ involvement， and body surface area involvement >50%； the absence of fever， lymphadenopathy， protracted resolution of rash >15 days and lack of characteris-tic biopsy features of the syndrome has made DRESS unlikely with a RegiSCAR-Group Diagnosis Score of 1 (no case) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【66】After excluding SCAR， the next differential diagnosis consid-ered among ADR was bullous pemphigoid (BP)， given the pres-ence of tense bulla.\n\n【67】Erythema multiforme (EM)-like BP versus bullous EM\n\n【68】This patient presented with skin lesions that were predomi-nantly purplish erythema and only one blister . It was a dilemma whether the presence of a single blister should raise a possibility of a bullous disorder. Furthermore，the pur-plish erythema had central darkening that gave it a targetoid appearance， which， at best， clinically resembled atypical ery-thema multiforme (EM) .\n\n【69】BP and EM represent 2 separate groups of pathologies； none-theless several reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20-23\\]</u> have documented that the clin-ical diagnosis of BP can be challenging when EM-like lesions are present， such as in this patient case.\n\n【70】The hallmark of BP is widespread tense blisters arising on normal or erythematous skin in an elderly person， often with marked pruritus confirmed by DIF and histology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Several clinical variants have been described， including classic (bul-lous)， localized， nodular， vegetating， erythrodermic， erosive， childhood， and drug-induced forms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. On the other hand， EM， which also can present as different subtypes (major， minor， recurrent， bullous and persistent) is generally diagnosed clini-cally with its polymorphous eruption of macules， papules， and characteristic target lesions that are symmetrically distributed with or without mucosal involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u> Cutaneous manifesta-tions of EM evolve over the course illness and vary widely 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.\n\n【71】The typical lesions for EM are target lesions， which are annu-lar and red or purple with an iris configuration， that are sym-metrically distributed with a propensity for the distal extremi-ties and subsequently spread in a centripetal manner 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. The characteristic feature is that the central area， which is slightly raised and cyanotic， is more involved than the periphery， hence the name target lesions. When the degree of damage to the skin is greater， the center of the target lesion becomes a ves-icle or a bulla 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【72】The correct clinical identification of BP from EM becomes difficult when BP is caused by a drug reaction. BP， in general， is usually idiopathic but may be associated with malignancy， medications， and rarely autoimmune disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The drug-induced bullous\n\n【73】pemphigoid subtype， compared to its idiopathic counterparts， is known to be difficult to diagnose clinically due to its EM like targetoid lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20，27，28\\]</u>. Similarly， unlike other subtypes of EM， bullous type EM presents with multiple blisters posing a di-agnostic challenge， and is most commonly associated with drug reactions， herpes simplex virus (HSV)， varicella zoster virus (VZV)， and rarely with mycoplasma pneumoniae infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29，30\\]</u>.\n\n【74】The etiologic and clinical overlap between the 2 entities-EM-like BP and bullous EM- also carries over to a histologi-cal level. It is generally considered that BP and EM cannot be distinguished on the basis of histological features alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. Histologically， BP demonstrates eosinophilic spongiosis or sub-epidermal bulla with numerous eosinophils 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. On the other hand， EM shows a significantly wider spectrum of findings with varying degree of involvement of the histologic layers of the skin and inconsistent inflammatory cell infiltrate that is often predominantly lymphocytic or eosinophilic at times 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>， as seen in this patient case. The stage of the disease， site of bi-opsy (center versus periphery) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>， clinical subtype 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>，and etiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>， contributes to the wide spectrum of histological appearance of EM. The predominantly eosinophilic infiltrate seen in BP is not diagnostic， since significant numbers of eo-sinophil infiltrate were present in 60% of bullous EM and 28%of macular EM lesions in other studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>.\n\n【75】Positive DIF for IgG， IgM， IgA， and C3 to confirm that bullae are due to antibody deposition at the dermo-epidermal junction， is the cornerstone test for the diagnosis of BP， along with the presence of circulating autoantibodies against hemidesmo-somal molecules in select cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，34\\]</u>. However， DIF results should be looked at closely since， according to Howland et al.， positive DIF for C3 and IgM has been observed in EM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>.\n\n【76】An important lesson from this patient case is that unless DIF is performed with the right skin biopsy technique， it could re sult in a false negative finding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>， and in our patient case， we had to obtain a repeat biopsy based on our strong clinical sus-picion. The biopsy site should be perilesional， as opposed to intralesional skin on the upper body within 2 cm of a bulla， or clinically uninvolved skin from the flexor aspect of a forearm or anterior thigh 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，35\\]</u>. Biopsy specimen from the lower legs should be avoided because of false-negative results in up to a third of samples from this region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36，37\\]</u>.\n\n【77】Eosinophilia from bullous pemphigoid\n\n【78】Lastly， this patient presented with peak AEC of 3423/mm3. Literature defines AEC >1500/mm’ as hypereosinophilia， and it may be associated with secondary tissue damage just from the cytotoxic content of elevated eosinophils regardless of the eti-ology. Hypereosinophilia could be non-hematologic (secondary or reactive) or a primary hematologic clonal disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38，39\\]</u>.\n\n【79】Therefore， hypereosinophilia， paradoxically， could be the pri-mary cause of end organ damageor just a secondary result of end organ damage from other causes. This poses a challenge to clinicians in understanding the chronology and cause-and-effect association of various diseases that present with a com-bination of hypereosinophilia and end organ involvement. For example， this patient presented with skin lesions， acute kidney injury， and systemic eosinophilia (serum eosinophilia， eosin-ophiluria， and eosinophilic infiltration of the dermis). This left us pondering whether the acute kidney injury was caused by hypereosinophilia triggered by an adverse reaction to cepha-lexin or acute kidney injury from interstitial nephritis induced by cephalexin caused a secondary hypereosinophilia. Literature review shows that essentially all organ systems may be suscep-tible to the effects of sustained eosinophilia. During follow-up of patients with hypereosinophilia， dermatologic involvement was the most common clinical manifestation reported in 69%of patients， followed by pulmonary manifestation (44%) and gastrointestinal manifestations (38%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38，40，41\\]</u>.\n\n【80】Another important lesson here is that if this patient had not presented early to receive the appropriate therapy， the eosinophilia would have continued to increase and led to additional end organ involvement， particularly the lungs and heart. Peripheral eosinophilia is seen in up to 50% of patients with BP with a median AEC of 1300/uL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. If untreated， this would obviously cause morbidity and mortality from the dis-ease， as well as from additional invasive diagnostic tests. The quick resolution of eosinophilia in this patient fits the pattern of drug allergies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>， yet a persistent level would have war-ranted a different approach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42\\]</u>. This highlights the need for proper diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause of hypereosinophilia as early as possible， to prevent secondary end organ damages.\n\n【81】Conclusions\n\n【82】This report provides a showcase for the atypical presenta-tion of drug induced BP. With a brief overview of drug re-actions， it calls for higher degree of familiarity with entities under Adverse Drug Reactions by general practitioners. In ad-dition， through a focused literature review on differences be-tween BP and EM， it navigates the unique set of diagnostic challenges of various dermatologic syndromes with overlap-ping features. In particular， it highlights key features of life-threatening dermatologic conditions referred to as severe cu-taneous adverse reactions (SCAR)： SJS， TEN， AGEP and DRESS. It also underscores vital lessons on appropriate biopsy tech-niques for BP (intralesional versus perilesional) to avoid mis-diagnosis and on the importance of early diagnosis and treat-ment of patients with hypereosinophilia.\n\n【83】References：\n\n【84】1\\.

These symptoms started immediately after the patient was struck in the chest by a large dog in the dog park which caused forceful rotation of the neck， but no impact to the head. EMS reported that the incident occurred 60 minutes before arrival in the Emergency Department (ED).\n\n【16】Initial vital signs obtained were temperature 98.0 orally， heart rate 83， blood pressure 160/97， respiratory rate 18， and pulse oximetry 99% room air. Patient’s weight 104 kg and blood glu-cose 183. Neurological examination showed the patient to be awake， alert and oriented to person， place， and time. Pupils were equal and reactive with normal gaze， but positive field cut to bilateral left upper outer quadrants. He also noted decreased sensation to the left arm and abnormal finger to nose testing of the left upper extremity. National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was calculated as 3.\n\n【17】Pertinent lab findings were as follows： hemoglobin 15.1 g/dL， platelets 159 K/uL， PT 13.1 s， INR 1.0， PTT 24 s， glucose 203\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1： Axial CTA of the neck demonstrating right internal carotid artery stenosis of 50%.Coronal reconstruction CTA of the neck demonstrating right internal carotid artery stenosis of 50%.</u>\n\n【19】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2： Diffusion-Weighted Image (DWI) axial sections are demonstrating restriction of diffusion in the posterior circulation as well as the MCA watershed territory.</u>\n\n【20】mg/dL， creatinine 0.9 mg/dL， and no alcohol detected. Non-contrast head computed tomography (CT) showed no evidence of intracranial haemorrhage with some periventricular white matter microangiopathic changes. CT angiography of the head revealed patent vasculature while CT angiography of the neck demonstrated 50% stenosis of the proximal right internal carotid artery secondary to a mural thrombus. Before the event， the patient had no known history of carotid disease.\n\n【21】The patient had no apparent traumatic injuries and no con-traindications to receive Ⅳ alteplase. After shared decision making with the ED team， the patient gave his consent to receive the fibrinolytic. The patient had improvement in his sensation to the left arm， but his visual field deficit and ataxia persisted. NIHSS was two upon transfer to the Neuroscience Intensive Care Unit. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain showed numerous subcentimeter foci of acute ischemia in the right cerebral hemisphere within the right middle cerebral and posterior cerebral distributions. The patient’s paresthesias to his left arm resolved as well as his dysmetria. He still had a mild left field cut but was able to be discharged to home three days later with an NIHSS of 1. Given the concern for carotid etiology along with embolic phenomena shortly after the moment of impact， the patient was placed on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel daily prior to discharge.\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】An increasing number of patients with TCVI are being identified largely because of the expanding use of CT angiography for screening patients with blunt trauma. Most literature about TCVI and stroke has been published in the trauma， general surgery， and neurosurgery literature because these patients are generally primarily managed by trauma surgeons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Because of the increasing prevalence and awareness of TCVI， it is essential to bring this clinical entity to the attention of other medical providers as well.\n\n【24】Extracranial TCVI is present in approximately 1-2% of pa-tients admitted after blunt trauma. Based on studies reporting that 10-20% of patients with TCVI have a stroke， TCVI may be responsible for up to 9600 ischemic strokes in the United States per year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. TCVI would， therefore， account for about 1.2% of total strokes that occur annually in the United States 4\\]. Motor vehicle crashes are the most common cause of TCVI， followed by assaults， falls， and hanging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【25】TCVI is markedly different from spontaneous dissections or dissections occurring after low-energy trauma. Specifically， most trauma patients experience a hypercoagulable state soon after injury. Spontaneous cervical arterial dissections tend to pri-marily affect the outer arterial wall， whereas with TCVI intimal disruptions are more common \\[11. The most common cause of ischemic stroke due to TCVI is thromboembolism. In one report of blunt trauma patients in two-level I trauma centers， 82% of patients with TCVI-related stroke had the stroke within 2 hours of injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【26】According to literature data， there are no distinct guidelines regarding the proper diagnostic and therapeutic management of traumatic carotid artery dissection. Although most of the cases evaluated in research studies refer to spontaneous carotid artery dissection， traumatic cases demand special considerations as far as diagnosis and treatment are concerned. Patients with TCVI can present with several other concomitant injuries， as well as a higher bleeding risk， thus complicating decision making in such patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Regarding proper medical treatment for spontaneous carotid artery dissection， anticoagulation or antiplatelets should be initi-ated promptly to prevent further thromboembolic events. Both types of agents show similar efficacy in reducing neurological sequelae without increasing the risk of stroke. However， cases of traumatic causes demand a more interdisciplinary approach and show specific considerations concerning treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【28】When other concomitant injuries with a high risk for severe bleeding are present， then the optimal type and time of treatment should be considered in an interdisciplinary approach including consultation by a trauma surgeon， orthopaedic surgeon， neu-rosurgeon， vascular surgeon， radiologist， and/or neurologist. Medical treatment should be initiated as soon as possible， includ-ing the use of thrombolytics when indicated. Concerning the role of thrombolysis in TCVI， data are limited in the literature given the high bleeding risk in trauma patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【29】The safety and efficacy of thrombolysis in even spontaneous cervical artery dissection (CAD) are controversial. One pooled analysis reviewed 180 patients， of which 67% received intra-venous thrombolysis， and 33% received intra-arterial thromboly-sis. The pooled symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage rate was3.1%， the overall mortality rate was 8.1%， and 41% had an ex-cellent outcome. Therefore， safety and outcome of thrombolysis in patients with cervical artery dissection stroke appears similar to those for stroke from all causes. This particular analysis con-cluded that thrombolysis should not be withheld after shared decision making with the patient and the medical team 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.For trauma patients as with all medical decision making， the risk versus benefit must always be weighed.\n\n【30】Conclusion\n\n【31】This case report discusses a 60-year-old male with known risk factors for ischemic stroke and thrombus of the right internal carotid artery that seems to have caused a thromboembolic event after a blunt traumatic episode to the chest leading to the wa-tershed middle cerebral artery infarcts and posterior circulation territory infarcts of the right hemisphere. Medical providers need to have heightened awareness of this growing entity of TCVI as it would be elementary to think of the injury and stroke as unrelated initially. With CT angiography of the neck becom-ing more standard in the evaluation of trauma patients， cervical artery dissections are being reported more than ever before 通用删除7(英):<u>(8)</u>. This case report emphasizes that TCVI is an increasing diag-nosis for medical providers and staff to be aware of and treat accordingly for best patient outcomes.\n\n【32】Disclosure Statement\n\n【33】There were no financial support or relationships between the authors and any organization or professional bodies that could pose conflict of interests.\n\n【34】Competing Interests\n\n【35】Written informed consent has been obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>References</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

We performed pelvic and bi-lateral lower-extremities angiography， which revealed that the bilateral external iliac arteries (ElAs) had the‘string of beads' appearance with a diagnosis of FMD. Endovascular therapy (EVT) was performed for the bi-lateral EIAs. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) images showed thickening and thinning of the middle layer， while three-dimensional OCT images showed a 'haustra coli'-like appearance. After successful balloon angio-plasty， claudication completely disappeared.\n\n【31】Conclusions：\n\n【32】We report a rare case of EVT successfully performed for FMD of the bilateral ElAs. Our findings suggest that OCT may provide unique diagnostic clues in FMD patients.\n\n【33】MeSH Keywords： Endovascular Procedures · Fibromuscular Dysplasia·lliac Artery· Tomography， Optical Coherence\n\n【34】Full-text PDF http：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/893167\n\n【35】Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a non-inflammatory， non-ath-erosclerotic， degenerative vascular disease that most frequently affects renal and carotid arteries in women aged 30-50 years， rarely complicating arteries of the lower limbs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Medial fi-broplasia is the most common histologic type of FMD. This wall weakness may be responsible for the formation of intraluminal webs causing stenosis， dissection， and aneurysmal formation. FMD of lower extremities arteries is an uncommon disease of unknown detailed etiology. The literature on FMD of the iliac artery in the past 30 years is almost all single case reports or small case series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. Recently， the clinical features， present-ing symptoms， and vascular events for FMD were reported in multicenter registry data from the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Although little is known about optical coherence tomography (OCT) find-ings and its importance in FMD patients， we report here our experience of successful endovascular therapy (EVT) and OCT findings for FMD of the bilateral external iliac arteries (EIAs).\n\n【36】Case Report\n\n【37】A 60-year-old female was referred to our hospital complaining of intermittent claudication in the bilateral calf， with a walk-ing distance of about 300 meters.

She had no history of connective tissue disease， which was also excluded by physical and lab-oratory examinations. Her ankle-brachial index (ABI) was 0.72on the right leg and 0.77 on the left， and peripheral artery dis-ease was suspected. As shown in Figure 1， digital subtraction angiography of the bilateral lower-extremities showed that the bilateral ElAs had stenosis with the ‘string of beads’ ap-pearance consistent with multifocal FMD. Savard et al. report-ed the angiographic classification of FMD； FMD lesions were\n\n【40】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2. Intravascular ultrasound revealed the non-atherosclerotic lesion and the formation of intraluminal webs causing stenosis.</u>\n\n【41】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3. Optical coherence tomography images clearly showed thickening and thinning of the middle layer (A)， while three-dimensional Optical coherence tomography images showed a 'haustra coli'-like appearance (B).</u>\n\n【42】classified as multifocal FMD if there were at least 2 stenoses in the same arterial segment， otherwise they were classified as unifocal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【43】Based on these angiograms， we offered her a low-invasive ap-proach using endovascular therapy (EVT) for the bilateral EIAs. We prepared bi-common femoral arteries with the 6Fr sys-tem Zemex sheath 25 cm (Zeon Medical Corporation， Tokyo， Japan) inserted from bi-common femoral arteries. An attempt to pass the stenotic site by use of a 0.014-inch chevalier flop-py wire (Future Medical Design Corporation， Saitama， Japan) was performed， and the guide wire easily crossed. There were40-50 mmHg pressure gradients in the bilateral ElAs lesions. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) (ViewIT， Terumo Corporation， Tokyo， Japan) revealed the non-atherosclerotic lesion and the formation of intraluminal webs causing stenosis . Furthermore， OCT images (C7 XR OCT Intravascular Imaging System， St. Jude Medical， Minnesota， USA) clearly showed thickening and thinning of the middle layer ， while three-dimensional OCT images showed a 'haustra coli’-like ap-pearance . Thus， we considered that IUS and OCT may be used as an adjunctive tool to diagnose and evaluate\n\n【44】FMD. We performed balloon angioplasty using a 6.0x80 mm balloon \\[Jackal RX 6.0x80 mm (Kaneka Corporation， Osaka， Japan)\\]. After angioplasty， pressure gradients in the bilateral ElAs lesions were decreased to 10-15 mmHg. Because it has been reported that patients with iliac artery FMD have coexist-ing FMD of the renal and coronary arteries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， we performed renal and coronary angiography. However， there were no ab-normal findings on the renal and coronary arteries in this case. The sheaths were removed， and the patient was discharged on the following day. The post-operative course was unevent-ful. The follow-up ABl at 4 weeks was improved (0.92 in the right leg and 0.91 in the left) and clinical success with symp-tom resolution was achieved. Balloon angioplasty alone had higher restenosis rates than angioplasty with stent. Although conventional balloon angioplasty without stenting appeared successful in this case and other reports about FMD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-6\\]</u>， close follow-up care is prudent for possible restenosis by in-terview and ABl measurement at 1， 3，6， and 12 months after EVT， and every 6 months thereafter. In addition， there were no abnormal findings on the cerebral and carotid arteries with magnetic resonance imaging in this patient.\n\n【45】Here we report a rare case of EVT for FMD of the bilateral EIAs successfully performed with support of imaging devices (IVUS and OCT). FMD mostly occurs in the renal artery (70%)， followed by the carotid artery (25%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Because stenotic lesions in lower extremities arteries are mostly caused by arteriosclero-sis obliterans， FMD of the ElA as in this case is extremely rare. It has been reported that the incidence of iliac artery FMD in patients with renal and/or carotid artery FMD is about 5%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Although the exact prevalence of FMD in the lower extremities arteries is unknown， ElA appears to most commonly involve the lower limbs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. It is important to elucidate the prevalence， natural history， optimal methods of diagnosis， and treatment of FMD by a multicenter registry in the future.\n\n【46】Although angiography remains the gold standard imaging tech-nique to diagnose and evaluate FMD for lacking specific mark-ers or effective non-invasive tests， it cannot accurately deter-mine the degree of arterial stenosis. The recent introduction of OCT is a novel method for obtaining tomographic images of a human organ based on the coherence of light. The reso-lution of OCT (to 10-20 um) is about 10-fold higher than that of IVUS (to 100-150 um) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Thus， OCT can differentiate the internal and external laminae， and is superior ability of detect-ing web formation in FMD than IUS as shown Figures 2 and 3. Catheter-based angiography was useful and excellent for diag-nostic confirmation of FMD. However， if the diagnosis， the de-gree of stenosis， and therapeutic effect remained uncertainly，\n\n【47】References：\n\n【48】1\\.

Thus， we considered that OCT might be a useful and feasible method for evaluating the obstructive webs and may aid in identifying the FMD.

Radical prostatectomy， i.e.， the surgical removal of the entire pros-tate， is a frequently used option. Biochemical recurrence (BCR)， i.e.， detectable prostate specific antigen (PSA)， is common in some men following such treatment. The timing of BCR to metastatic spread of disease in bones is usually a few years. Ifthe biochemical failure occurs after a longer duration from the time of curative intent， it is generally believed to lead to local recurrence.\n\n【24】Case Report：\n\n【25】We report on two cases. A 78-year-old male was diagnosed with Gleason 7， prostate cancer in 2001. He subse-quently underwent an open radical prostatectomy. Serial post-operative PSA’s were undetectable (<0.01 ng/mL) up to 2016. He was diagnosed with a detectable PSA for the first time with a value of 0.3 ng/mL， that year. The PSA continued to rise to a level of 1.1 ng/mL This rise in the PSA was within a 12-month interval. Subsequent bone scan and bone biopsy detected prostate cancer metastasis in multiple bones. Our second case was a65-year-old male who underwent a laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in the year 2006 for a biopsy proven prostate cancer with Gleason 3+4=7. Serial post-operative PSA's were undetectable up to 2017. Within a span of 8 months， the PSA rose from 0.3 ng/mL to 1.52 ng/mL. A positron emission tomography scan demonstrat-ed pubic bone lesion indicative of prostate cancer metastasis.\n\n【26】Conclusions：\n\n【27】BCR can occur a decade after curative intent treatment of prostate cancer. The duration from BCR to detect-able metastasis can be shorter. We demonstrated here that the site of recurrence， in such scenarios， can be distant metastasis and not local recurrence alone. Better imaging modalities are needed to identify the spread of prostate cancer at low levels of PSA.\n\n【28】MeSH Keywords： Diagnostic Imaging · Neoplasm Metastasis · Prostatic Neoplasms\n\n【29】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/918569\n\n【30】Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in males in the United States. Annually 174 650 new cases are diag-nosed in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Mortality from prostate cancer is predicted to be in the range of 31 620 deaths for the year2019通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Surgery and radiation therapy are some of the most common， standard of care treatments for prostate cancer. Most cases (77%) of prostate cancer are localized at the time of the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The 5-year overall survival rates for men who have undergone curative treatment for localized prostate cancer are high 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. However， a significant number of men who are treated primarily with curative intent will fail primary treat-ment. Failure of primary treatment is usually diagnosed by a detectable or a rising PSA which is termed biochemical recur-rence (BCR). It is estimated that 40% of the patients undergo-ing radical prostatectomy may experience BCR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Metastasis， which may occur subsequently， is involvement of a distant or-gan， typically bone or lymph node by prostate cancer. The tran-sition from BCR to metastasis has been described to be a pro-longed duration， extending over years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Detection of this metastasis to bone generally requires the presence of a high level of PSA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The fundamental question remains whether the rise in the PSA is indicative of local recurrence or metastat-ic disease. Patients experiencing this clinical scenario seek a clear understanding of likely future events. Clinicians manag-ing these situations should be aware of a multitude of possible situations other than those previously described in literature.\n\n【31】We describe 2 clinical scenarios which demonstrate that this period from BCR to detection of bone metastasis may be short-er than has been earlier described in literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. We also demonstrate that the spread of cancer to bone in this setting may occur at very low levels of PSA.\n\n【32】Case Reports\n\n【33】A 63-year-old African American male was diagnosed with an elevated PSA of 6.7 ng/mL in the year 2001. He underwent a prostate biopsy and was diagnosed with Gleason 3+4=7， prostate cancer the same year. Following a negative meta-static workup that included a computerized tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis， he subsequently underwent an open radical prostatectomy (ORP) in 2001. TNM stage， post radical prostatectomy (RP) was T2cN0M0， with a Gleason3+4=7. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) readings post radical prostatectomy were undetectable (<0.01 ng/mL) until 2016. In2016 (now aged 78 years)， his PSA was detectable for the first time， value being 0.3 ng/mL. From our chart review， no active monitoring or recommendations seem to have been made at this time. In September 2017 he complained of low back and knee pain. He presented to the emergency department and\n\n【34】had spine and knee x-rays， which were essentially normal. He was referred to a urologist as part of follow-up.\n\n【35】He was seen and evaluated by the urologist. Following a clini-calevaluation， repeat blood work (PSA) and bone scan were or-dered. His PSA had increased to 1.1 ng/mL in October 2017.He underwent a technetium 99 m medronate bone scan (26.1 mCi intravenous)  which demonstrated multiple lesions in the spine， sacrum， and pelvic bones.\n\n【36】In October 2017， he underwent a bone biopsy. This demon-strated metastatic involvement of the bone from poorly differ-entiated carcinoma， suspicious for prostate cancer .\n\n【37】He is on androgen deprivation therapy because of the symp-tomatic nature of the bone metastasis.\n\n【38】The second case was a 52-year-old male who was diagnosed with Gleason 3+4=7， prostate cancer after undergoing a bi-opsy for a PSA of 5.4 ng/mL in the year 2006. He then un-derwent a laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in 2006， after a negative metastatic workup， which included a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. TNM stage post radical prostatecto-my was T3aN0MO， with Gleason 3+4=7. Post radical prosta-tectomy PSA readings were undetectable until 2017. His PSA was detectable， in the BCR range， in October 2018 to a value of 0.3 ng/mL. In April 2019 (now aged 65 years) the PSA had risen to a value of 1.52ng/mL. A technetium 99m medronate(26.1 mCi intravenous) bone scan was negative for metastasis. However， a fluciclovine (9.8 mCi intravenous) positron emis-sion tomography (PET) scan  demonstrated a lesion indicative of metastasis on the pubic bone.\n\n【39】After discussion of all the treatment options， the patient elect-ed to be on androgen deprivation therapy.\n\n【40】In summary both men had Gleason 3+4=7 prostate cancer. Both men had radical prostatectomy， with curative intent， for pros-tate cancer. These men had an undetectable PSA (≤0.2 ng/mL) for at least over a decade. After the PSA had reached BCR de-tectable levels， there was an acute rise in the PSA values. Both men were detected with bone metastasis at low PSA levels.\n\n【41】Discussion\n\n【42】Although BCR is a well-accepted pathophysiological phenome-non， the PSA value at which it is considered BCR has been var-ied， too. Following surgical removal of the prostate， the defini-tion of BCR has been a rise of or equal to 0.2 ng/mL通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Some institutes have described BCR as a value of 0.4 ng/mL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. For men with a rising PSA after radiation therapy the ASTRO-Phoenix definition of BCR is the nadir value + 2 ng/mL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【43】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1.

Fluciclovine positron emission tomography (PET) scan demonstrating presence of metastasis in right pubic bone.</u>\n\n【46】A rise in the PSA after definitive treatment is none the less. considered evidence of recurrent disease.\n\n【47】BCR provides the earliest evidence that there is recurrent or re-sidual disease. The clinical use of BCR as a surrogate end point for intervention to alter the subsequent natural history of cancer thereof has been questionable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. A detectable PSA after defin-itive treatment may imply either local recurrence or distant re-currence. Distant recurrence is cancer spreading to bones or soft tissue， e.g.， lymph nodes and solid organs. Local recurrence is generally recurrence of disease in the prostatic fossa if the pros-tate was removed or in the prostate， if the initial treatment was radiation therapy. There are different treatment implications for treating men with BCR who have failed locally or distant. Local recurrence may still be amenable to salvage radiation or salvage radical prostatectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Distant metastasis generally would re-quire systemic therapy like androgen deprivation therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【48】The implications on developing a BCR are not definitive. Detection of BCR does not necessarily indicate a terminal out-come. Frazier et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> demonstrated that about 93% of the patients with BCR had not failed clinically， i.e.， no evidence of detectable metastasis. Jhaveri et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> demonstrated that the difference in overall survival in men with BCR and no BCR at 10 years was minimal.\n\n【49】The timing of BCR from the definitive treatment has been con-sidered important for differentiating between local and distant recurrence.Studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> indicate the shorter the duration of BCR\n\n【50】from surgery， PSA detection indicates “occult distant metasta-sis\". Whereas longer intervals imply a local recurrence通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In our case reports though， the duration from curative intent surgery to BCR was over a decade； the recurrence seems to be asso-ciated with distant bone metastasis and not local recurrence.\n\n【51】The rate at which the PSA rises has been used to predict the location of recurrent disease. Partin et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> also demon-strated that local recurrence is more common when the PSAV was <0.75 ng/mL per year. When the PSA doubling time was>12 months Patel et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> showed that the recurrence was more likely to be local. Generally， PSA doubling time of <6months implies a likelihood of distant recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Faster rise of PSA appears to be associated with distant metastasis. This seems to be the case in our 2 case reports.\n\n【52】Detection of spread to bone has significance in the algorithm of decision-making. However， detecting the spread to bones has long been a diagnostic challenge. Bone scans yield lower sensitivity in patients with low PSA values. Oesterling et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> thought that any BCR value which was lower than 2 ng/mL did not benefit from a bone scan. Cher et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> demonstrated that the lowest PSA associated with a positive bone scan was46 ng/mL in their series. In PSA only recurrence， Moul et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> felt that bone scan had limited value unless the PSA exceeds30 to 40 ng/mL. Even with lower PSA value， our cases had the presence of bone metastasis.\n\n【53】The duration between BCR and detecting distant metastasis has been reported earlier 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The median actuarial time from BCR to metastasis was reported to be 5 years (mean 8 years) according to Pound et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. This was a seminal paper describ-ing the natural history of BCR. This paper also demonstrated that the time from metastasis to death was approximately 5vears. Our case scenarios seem to demonstrate that the du-ration from detection of BCR to bone metastasis was much shorter than described in this paper.\n\n【54】The presence and natural history of BCR has been studied for a long time. There has been some evidence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> to suggest that the predictors of location and metastasis are related to the timing of the recurrence from the initial definitive therapy. The dura-tion of BCR and time to detectable metastasis was described to be multiple years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The 2 cases presented in this report demonstrated that the duration from BCR to metastasis can be short. Even at low values of PSA， there can be metastatic involvement of bone. In Case 1， the bone metastasis was prov-en by a bone biopsy and a bone scan. In Case 2， the involve-ment was not detected on technetium 99m bone scan but was positive on fluciclovine PET scan. This could also imply that the duration from BCR to metastasis may not be as definitive as previously implied. Clinicians need to have a high level of suspicion for detecting the presence of metastasis even with\n\n【55】low PSA values. Traditionally used imaging modalities like tech-netium bone scans have a lower sensitivity to detect metas-tasis at low PSA levels. Newer technology like fluciclovine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> PET scan may help in scenarios wherein the traditional imag-ing techniques are not sensitive enough to detect metastasis.\n\n【56】Conclusions\n\n【57】Delayed BCR is possible in prostate cancer.

The purpose of this article was to compare the effect of mineralocorticoid receptor blockers on plasma renin activity levels in a patient with primary aldosteronism.\n\n【29】Case Report：\n\n【30】The patient was a 45-year-old male with severe hypertension. Because his aldosterone/renin ratio was high and a saline infusion test was positive， primary aldosteronism was diagnosed. Computed tomography revealed a low-density mass measuring 10 mm in the left adrenal gland. Segmental adrenal vein sampling demonstrated bilateral primary aldosteronism， so pharmacotherapy was started. Before treatment， his plasma renin activity was 0.5 ng/mL/hour. Eplerenone was commenced and the dose was increased to 100 mg/day. However， his plasma renin activity was still 0.8 ng/mL/hour and the maximum dose of eplerenone did not elevate plasma re-nin activity above 1 ng/mL/hour. Since plasma renin activity remained below 1 ng/mL/hour with mineralocorti-coid receptor antagonist therapy， this patient was considered to have a higher cardiovascular risk than patients with essential hypertension. Accordingly， eplerenone was switched to esaxerenone， a new generation mineralo-corticoid receptor blocker that became available in May 2019. After switching to esaxerenone (5 mg/day)， the patient's plasma renin activity increased to 1.8 ng/mL/hour and subsequently remained at 1 ng/mL/hour or higher.\n\n【31】Conclusions：\n\n【32】This is the first case report to present interesting changes of plasma renin activity in a primary aldosteronism patient after switching from eplerenone to esaxerenone. Elevation of plasma renin activity by esaxerenone in our primary aldosteronism patient reflected a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonistic effect that may have al-leviated excessive mineralocorticoid receptor activation and volume expansion.\n\n【33】MeSH Keywords：\n\n【34】Hyperaldosteronism· Hypertension· Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists•Renin-Angiotensin System\n\n【35】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/920615\n\n【36】品目日\\]1657 山：4 22\n\n【37】It has been reported that cardiovascular risk is reduced in pri-mary aldosteronism patients if plasma renin activity (PRA) is1.0 ng/mL/hour or higher following initiation of treatment with a mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However， if PRA remains below 1.0 ng/mL/hour， MR antagonist therapy is not sufficient to improve cardiometabolic outcomes such as death and atrial fibrillation in primary aldosteronism patients compared to patients with essential hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The ob-jective of this report was to present the different effect of MR blockers on PRA levels in a patient with primary aldosteronism.\n\n【38】Case Report\n\n【39】The patient was a 45-year-old male. Despite oral administra-tion of telmisartan (80 mg/day) and nifedipine (80 mg/day)， his blood pressure remained high (2170/100 mmHg) and he was considered to have severe hypertension. Since secondary hypertension was suspected， screening for endocrine diseases was conducted. Antihypertensive therapy was switched to only calcium channel blockers (amlodipine at 10 mg/day and nife-dipine at 80 mg/day). Laboratory tests revealed hypokalemia， with potassium being 3.5 mmol/L. PRA was 0.4 ng/mL/hour and the plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) was 194 pg/mL. The aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR) was high 通用删除7(英):<u>(484)</u>. The blood sampling was always obtained under supine position. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a low-density mass measuring10 mm in the left adrenal gland， and an adrenal adenoma was\n\n【40】suspected . A saline infusion test was conducted by administering 2 L of saline over 4 hours. Pre-infusion PRA was0.5 ng/mL/hour and pre-infusion PAC was 129 pg/mL， while post-infusion PRA was 0.1 ng/mL/hour and post-infusion PAC was 88.3 pg/mL Because post-infusion PAC was 260 pg/mL， the result was positive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Primary aldosteronism was diag-nosed. The patient selected curative treatment by partial ad-renalectomy， so segmental adrenal vein sampling (S-AVS) was conducted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. If excess aldosterone production from the le-sion was confirmed by S-AVS， partial adrenalectomy includ-ing the tumor could be performed to preserve the function of the residual gland.\n\n【41】Before S-AVS， infusion of synthetic adrenocorticotropic hor-mone (tetracosactide acetate) was commenced at 0.1 mg/hour. We performed S-AVS under guidance with biplane cine angiography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Then a microcatheter was advanced through the guiding catheter into the segmental adrenal tributary vein. Figure 2 shows images of the adrenal veins obtained in the frontal view and the lateral view. Contrast enhancement of 3branches was noted， and blood sampling from those branches was possible. Despite searching for the mass previously ob-served in the left adrenal gland by CT， it was not clearly iden-tified. Blood sampling was performed at 16 sites . Confirmation that the catheter had been inserted into the adrenal vein was based on a plasma cortisol concentra-tion (PCC) (≥200 ug/dl) following adrenocoiticotropic hor-mone (ACTH) stimulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>，and a PCC >5 times that in the inferior vena cava 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.

Based on these definitions， aldosterone hyper-secretion was observed at 4 sites in the left adrenal gland and4 in the right adrenal gland. In the left adrenal venous system， PAC 214 000 pg/mL was detected at the common stem， the su-perior tributary vein near where the mass was considered to exist， and the lateral tributary vein. And in the right adrenal venous system， PAC 214 000 pg/mL was detected in an inferior tributary vein， lateral tributary vein， and the main right adrenal vein， but not the superior tributary vein. We considered that the left adrenal gland might contain both an aldosterone-pro-ducing adenoma and microadenoma. And the microadenomas\n\n【45】might be scattered through the right adrenal gland. In addi-tion， other possibility was considered that the patient might have bilateral scattered idiopathic hyperaldosteronism and left non-functioning tumor. The diagnosis of bilateral primary aldosteronism was supported by lateralized ratio： 2.0 (39/20) and contralateral ratio： 1.5 (20/13) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Since the patient was shown to have bilateral primary aldosteronism， it was consid-ered that curative surgical treatment would be difficult， and pharmacotherapy was selected instead.\n\n【46】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3. Results of segmental adrenal vein sampling. Blood samples were collected at 16 sites. The site number， PAC， PCC， and PAC/PCC ratio following ACTH stimulation are indicated. If blood samples from the adrenal gland are defined as PCC≥200 ug/dL with ACTH stimulation， blood from the adrenal gland was sampled at sites 4， 5， 6， 7， 8，9， 10， 11，12，13， 14， and 15. In the left adrenal venous system， PAC was >14 000 pg/mL at the junction of the common stem， superior tributary vein， and lateral tributary vein (sites 4， 6， 7， and 10)， indicating a diagnosis of aldosterone-producing adenoma and microadenoma. In the right adrenal venous system， PAC was 214 000 pg/mL in the inferior tributary vein， lateral tributary vein， and main right adrenal vein， but not the superior tributary vein (sites 11， 12， 14， and 15). It was considered that microadenomas secreting a large amount of aldosterone were present in the right adrenal gland.

First， amlodipine (10 mg/day) and nifedip-ine (80 mg/day) were administered. After S-AVS， nifedipine was decreased to 40 mg/day and eplerenone (50 mg/day) was added. Eplerenone was subsequently increased to 100 mg/day， and nifedipine was discontinued. Prior to starting eplerenone， serum potassium， PAC， PRA， and ARR levels were 3.6 mmol/L，129 pg/mL， 0.5 ng/mL/hour， and 258， respectively. After 2months of treatment with eplerenone at 100 mg/day， serum potassium， PAC， PRA， and ARR were 3.7 mmol/L， 323 pg/mL，0.8 ng/mL/hour， and 404， respectively. Thus， the maximum dose of eplerenone did not elevate PRA beyond 1 ng/mL/hour. Because PRA remained below 1 ng/mL/hour during treatment with an MR antagonist， this patient was considered to have a higher cardiovascular risk than patients with essential HT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. We wanted to increase the MR antagonist dose further to\n\n【48】achieve more potent MR blockade， but the maximum dose of eplerenone allowed under the Japanese health insurance sys-tem is 100 mg/day， and use of eplerenone with spironolac-tone is contraindicated.\n\n【49】Accordingly， we hypothesized that switching from eplerenone to a new generation MR blocker， esaxerenone， might elevate PRA， and we switched from eplerenone (100 mg/day) to esaxer-enone (5 mg/day). After 1 month，serum potassium， PAC， PRA， and ARR levels were 3.9 mmol/L， 365 pg/mL，1.8 ng/mL/hour， and 203， respectively. PRA was maintained at 1 ng/mL/hour or higher by esaxerenone.\n\n【50】The blood pressure changed from 162/104 mmHg to 158/106mmHg by exchange from eplerenone to esaxerenone. And the body weight increased from 90.6 kg to 93.3 kg during the last 4 months.\n\n【51】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4. Clinical course. At initial presentation， telmisartan (80 mg/day) and nifedipine (80 mg/day) were commenced. Telmisartan was then switched to amlodipine (10 mg/day). After AVS， nifedipine was reduced to 40 mg/day， and eplerenone (50 mg/day) was added before discharge. Thereafter， eplerenone was increased to 100 mg/day and nifedipine was discontinued. Prior to starting eplerenone， serum potassium， PAC， PRA， and ARR levels were 3.6 mmol/L， 129 pg/mL，0.5 ng/mL/hour， and 258， respectively. After 2 months of treatment with eplerenone at 100 mg/day， serum potassium， PAC， PRA， and ARR levels were3.7 mmol/L， 323 pg/mL， 0.8 ng/mL/hour， and 404， respectively. The maximum dose of eplerenone did not increase PRA above1 ng/mL/hour. However， 1 month after eplerenone was switched to esaxerenone (5 mg/day)， serum potassium， PAC， PRA， and ARR levels were 3.9 mmol/L， 365 pg/mL， 1.8 ng/mL/hour， and 203， respectively. PRA was maintained at 1 ng/mL/hour or higher.

Surgical adrenalectomy (or par-tial resection) can decrease the cardiovascular risk associated with excessive aldosterone production. However， physicians tend to hesitate to perform AVS and adrenalectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，10，11\\]</u>. Accordingly， many primary aldosteronism patients receive oral MR antagonist therapy as an alternative to surgery， including some patients who could be cured by surgery.\n\n【53】Our patient case is the first reported case in which switch-ing eplerenone to esaxerenone resulted in elevation of PRA. There have been reports of antihypertensive effects of esaxer-enone in essential hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>， but there are few reports in primary aldosteronism. In addition， there are no data from\n\n【54】prospective clinical studies to show whether suppressing PRA by dose escalation or switching an MR antagonist reduces the cardiovascular risk. In primary aldosteronism patients whose PRA does not exceed 1 ng/mL/hour despite oral administra-tion of an MR antagonist， using a higher MR antagonist dose or switching to another drug may result in an increase of PRA. However， a prospective study would be needed to determine if cardiovascular risk is also reduced.\n\n【55】In the present patient case， the hypotensive effect was not strong enough； this may have been due to insufficient diet/exer-cise therapy， including restriction of salt intake， which led to an increase of body weight. Unfortunately， we didn't analyze urinary sodium and creatinine before and after the adminis-tration of esaxerenone. It is also possible that decreasing the dosage of calcium antagonists might have been responsible.\n\n【56】There have been various reports about the influence of other MR antagonists on hypertension. However， esaxerenone only became available in May 2019， and there are few reports on the use of esaxerenone for hypertension or primary aldo-steronism. MR antagonists are effective for treatment-resis tant hypertension， and adding spironolactone to standard antihypertensive therapy is effective for decreasing the blood pressure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. A combination of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril and eplerenone has been shown to demonstrate a more potent antihypertensive effect compared to monotherapy with either drug， as well as inhib-iting left ventricular hypertrophy and decreasing albuminuria. It is anticipated that MR antagonists will exert diverse effects in patients with primary aldosteronism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Our patient was switched from eplerenone， a conventional MR antagonist， to esaxerenone， which binds to and inhibits the MR， and also reduces re-absorption of water from the collecting ducts by blocking re-absorption of sodium to lower the blood pres-sure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，16\\]</u>. In vitro studies have compared conventional ste-roidal MR antagonists (spironolactone and eplerenone) with esaxerenone， showing that it inhibits binding of aldosterone to the MR at a low concentration and has no influence on glu-cocorticoid receptors， androgen receptors， and progesterone receptors even at high concentrations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. In addition，esax-erenone is well absorbed and has a longer half-life than spi-ronolactone or eplerenone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17-19\\]</u>. Thus， esaxerenone is a selective and strong MR antagonist， which are characteris-tics that may have contributed to elevation of PRA in our pa-tient. Esaxerenone inhibited the elevation of blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner in rats with salt-sensitive hyper-tension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. An increase of left ventricular mass is dose-de-pendently inhibited by spironolactone， eplerenone，and esax-erenone， while esaxerenone dose-dependently decreases the blood level of brain natriuretic peptide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.

His past medical history was remarkable for frequent episodes of diarrhea， recurrent infections， and swelling in the lower limbs. In addition， he had been hospitalized several times in non-academic hospitals due to edema in his legs， cellulitis， and recurrent infections. In the emergency department， a physical examination revealed a patient in distress. He was weak， dehydrated， pale， and had a high-grade fever. His lower extremities were edematous， swollen， and extremely tender to touch. The overlying skin was erythematous and warm. Moreover， the patient was tachycardic， tacypneic， and moderately hypotensive. The patient was resuscitated with IV fluids， and Tylenol was administered to bring the temperature down. Blood tests showed anemia and high levels of inflammatory markers. The patient's white blood cell count was ele-vated with an obvious left shift. However， subsequent investigations showed that the patient had IL Suitable diet modification plans were applied as a long-term management plan.\n\n【27】Conclusions：\n\n【28】IL is a rare disease of challenging nature due to its systematic effects and lack of comprehensive studies that can evaluate the effectiveness of specific treatments in a large cohort of patients. Medium-chain triglyceride(MCT) oils and diet modification strategies are effective in reducing the loss of body proteins and in maintain-ing near-normal blood levels of immunoglobulins. However， octreotide and MCT oils had no proven role in re-ducing lymphedema in our patient.\n\n【29】MeSH Keywords： Lymphangiectasis， Intestinal·Octreotide · Protein-Losing Enteropathies ·Cellulitis\n\n【30】Full-text PDF http：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/899636\n\n【31】Intestinal lymphangiectasia (IL) is a rare disorder characterized by impaired intestinal lymphatic drainage due to primary ecta-sia， diffuse or localized， of the intestinal lymphatic vessels， or as a result of secondary impacts on the normal lymph circula-tion， such as heart diseases and retroperitoneal lymph node enlargements 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Regardless of the cause， the pathogenesis of IL involves a dilation of the intestinal lymphatic vessels and an increase in the interstitial pressure， leading to lymph fluid leakage into the intestinal lumen. This outflow of lymph fluid decreases the plasma oncotic pressure due to a lack of proteins and gamma-globulins in the plasma. In addition， fat， lympho-cytes，electrolytes，and fat soluble vitamins can be depleted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>.\n\n【32】The age of disease onset is variable. Although the diagnosis was established， in multiple studies， in infants. But IL has been ob-served in older age groups. It has been reported that the mean age of disease onset is twelve years.No etiological causes for IL have been identified， and genetic etiology is not clearly defined. Almost all the reported cases are of sporadic origin and familial stories of IL in first- or second-degree relatives are rarely report-ed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Prevalence is unknown and disease distribution around the world is poorly researched due to the rareness of the disease.\n\n【33】The symptoms of IL are variable depending on its severity. The classical symptoms are bilateral or unilateral lower limb ede-ma and intermittent diarrhea. Some patients develop steator-rhea； in other cases， an accumulation of fluids in body cavities resulting in pleural effusion or ascites has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>. The main patient complaints are abdominal pain， nausea and vomiting， intermittent diarrhea and steatorrhea， chronic fa tigue， weakness， weight loss， and inability to gain weight.\n\n【34】IL is a challenging disease due to its physical characteristics and its psychological effects on the patients and their families. Diet modification plans，medium-chain triglycerides (MCT)， Oc-treotide， antiplasmin， and surgical procedures have been intro-duced as management choices for the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-10\\]</u>.\n\n【35】Here， we present a case of a patient with IL This patient was followed， closely， for more than three years. In addition， we searched the literature looking for similar cases of IL. The pur-pose of this report is two-folds： to present our case study and IL management plan and present the conclusions from an in-vestigation of the literature.\n\n【36】Case Report\n\n【37】A 24-year-old male was admitted to Aleppo university Hospital(AUH)， in 2010， with the complaints of abdominal pain， head-ache， arthralgia， fever， and rigors. The patient stated that he had，\n\n【38】since infancy， intermittent episodes of foul-smelling diarrhea. These episodes were accompanied by abdominal pain， nausea， and vomiting. The patient was suffering from intractable bilateral swelling in the lower limbs， more prominent in his left leg. This swelling was responsible for restricting his daily life activities.\n\n【39】The current hospitalization was one in a series of admissions to a non-academic hospitals， inside and outside the country. These admissions were for multiple reasons. Reviewing the patient's medical history revealed that recurrent infections were the most common cause for all of his previous hospital-izations. In the emergency department， a physical examination revealed a distressed patient with an ill appearance. He was weak， dehydrated， pale， and had a high-grade fever of 39.6℃(103.2F). The patient was lying supine on the exam table with his legs drawn down， arms on his abdomen， and he was shiv-ering and staring with an anxious facial expressions and eyes that were filled with tears. Moreover， the patient was dyspne-ic with a respiratory rate of 17 beats/minute and without Cy-anotic hue； his oxygen saturation was 92%. The patient was tachycardic (pulse rate， 125 beats/minute)， and moderately hypotensive (blood pressure 97/60 mm Hg).\n\n【40】The patient's lower extremities were severely edematous，and extremely tender to touch. The overlying skin was erythema-tous and warm. The redness of the skin extended from the left popliteal area to the scrotum， which was enlarged but not ten-der to palpation. The skin covering the scrotum had changed to a very thick and hard skin mass. Further investigation re-vealed that the patient had an insect bite on the top of his left foot， one week ago.\n\n【41】The patient was resuscitated with lV fluids. Tylenol was infused to bring his temperature down， and to control pain. Blood tests in the emergency department showed a high C-reactive protein(CRP) level and an elevation in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). White blood cell count was 18，500 per mm’with 85%neutrophilia. Hemoglobin was 10.3 g/dL and the hematocrit was31%. The patient was admitted to the general internal medicine department in AUH for further investigations and management.\n\n【42】In the general internal medicine department， the management plan was applied immediately，including I fluids， empiric anti-biotic therapy， and analgesics. Additional blood samples were drawn for further laboratory testing， blood culture， and anti-biotic sensitivity tests. Table 1 presents a summary of the lab-oratory test results.\n\n【43】Doppler ultrasound study of the lower limbs and scrotum was performed and showed a diffuse thickening， increasing the echogenicity of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. These find-ings were accompanied by hypoechoic strands of fluids that extended between the hyperechoic fat and the underlying\n\n【44】Table 1.Results of blood tests.\n\n|  | Blood test  | Results  | Normal range  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | WBC and differential  | 18，500 (N 85%-L5%)  | 5-10×1，000/mm  |\n| CBCs  | HGB  | 10.3  | 12-18 g/dL  |\n| CBCs  | HCT  | 31  | 37-52%  |\n| CBCs  | PLT  | 322  | 150-450×10/L  |\n| Inflam matory markers  | ESR  | 43/72  | mm/L  |\n| Inflam matory markers  | CRP  | 32  | mg/L  |\n| RFIS  | Urea  | 45  | 7-20 mg/dL  |\n| RFIS  | Creatinine  | 0.7  | 0.6-1.2 mg/dL  |\n| Electrolytes  | Sodium  | 135  | 135-145 mmol/L  |\n| Electrolytes  | Potassium  | 3.8  | 3.5-5.5 mmol/L  |\n| Electrolytes  | Calcium  | 7.9  | 8.5-10.2 mg/dL  |\n| Electrolytes  | Magnesium  | 1.7  | 1.5-2.5 mEq/L  |\n|  | ALT/AST  | 45/35  | 7-56 unit/L  |\n| LFIS  | PT  | 13.8  | Seconds  |\n| LFIS  | INR  | 1.1  |  |\n|  | ALP  | 110  | 44-147 IU/L  |\n| Chemistry  | Bilirubin (total/direct)  | 1/0.8  | 0.3-1.9 mg/dL  |\n| Chemistry  | Total protein  | 3.2  | 6-8 g/dl  |\n| Chemistry  | Albumin  | 2.1  | 3.5-5.5 g/dL  |\n| Immunology  | ANA  | Negative  | <1/0IU  |\n| Immunology  | Anti-dsDNA  | Negative  | <1/0U  |\n| Immunology  | IGG  | 35  | 650-1，500 mg/dL  |\n| IG  | IGA  | 10  | 80-350mg/dL  |\n| IG  | IGM  | 14  | 45-250 mg/dL  |\n| IG  | GE  | 2  | 150-1，000 UI/mL  |\n|  | TSH  | 1.6  | 0.3-5.0 U/mL  |\n| Thyroid function test  | FT4  | 1.1  | 0.8-2.8 ng/dL  |\n|  | Cholesterol  | 79  | 180-200 mg/dL  |\n| Lipid profile  | LDL  | 80  | 100-129 mg/dL  |\n| Lipid profile  | HDL  | 42  | 35-65 mg/dL  |\n|  | TG  | 35  | 150-200 mg/dl  |\n\n【46】CBC- cell blood count； WBC -white blood cell； HGB -hemoglobin； HCT - hematocrit； PLT-platelet； ESR-erythrocyte sedimentation rate； CRP -C-reactive protein； RFT- renal function test； LFT -liver function test； ALT - alanine aminotransferase； AST - aspartate aminotransferase； ALP - alkaline phosphate； PT - prothrombin time； INR-international normalized ratio； ANA - antinuclear antibody； Anti-dsDNA-anti-double stranded DNA； IG -immunoglobulin； LDL -low-density lipoprotein； HDL- high-density lipoprotein； TG -triglycerides.\n\n【47】connective tissues. A characteristic “cobblestone”appearance was observed along the left leg. The veins in the left leg were non-compressible and Doppler flow was clearly sufficient. The vessels in the scrotum area were intact and the blood supply to the testes was adequate. An accumulation of scrotal flu ids was observed bilaterally， extending slightly to the penis.\n\n【48】Abdominal sonogram revealed an edematous gallbladder wall and large bowel loops with markedly thickened walls. A slight amount of ascetic fluid was observed in the peritoneal cavity.\n\n【49】Three days later， when the patient clinically stabilized， further investigational procedures were planned to study the swelling of the lower limbs. The CT scan was very useful in identifying dilated intestinal loops and a diffuse thickening of the intes-tinal walls， as well as mesenteric edema. The CT scan showed that the circumferential thickening of the small bowel wall was enlarged (1.5-2cm).\n\n【50】One week later， an endoscopic examination was performed， which was significant for mucosal changes and white spots and nodules (dilated lacteals) . Multiple biopsies were obtained for further histological examinations， which showed a characteristic dilatation of the enteric lymph ves-sels in the mucosal and submucosal layers without any evi-dence of inflammation. The histological examination was sug-gestive of IL .\n\n【51】The results of our investigations， integrated with the patient's clinical picture， were suggestive of an IL associated with cel-lulites in the left lower limb.\n\n【52】Three weeks later， the patient was totally recovered； he was discharged home and scheduled for a routine follow-up visits in the internal medicine clinic at AUH.\n\n【53】The patient was followed for more than three years. His long term management plan was designed to primarily educate the patient and his parents about the specifics of his disease. In addition， the management included dietary modifications， routine screening tests， and some medications to control his chronic diarrhea. The patient was advised to use a compres-sion stocking， raise his leg while in a supine position，and to do routine massages to the lower limbs.\n\n【54】While the patient was under observation in the hospital， octreo-tide was applied subcutaneously， and we continued this treat-ment with a slow-release formu lation for a period of six months.\n\n【55】The most important part of our management plan was diet modifications. The nutritionist in our clinic had educated the patient to substitute the long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) in his food with medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs). Due to its avail-ability and cheapness， the patient started to consume palm oil as a per-oral morning load and in his daily meals. He followed the palm oil diet for seventeen months. The palm oil diet was replaced later with a coconut oil diet. See  for clini-cal features of IL in our patient.\n\n【56】In order to track the effectiveness of the previously mentioned procedures on the amount of swelling in the lower limb， we measured the diameter of his leg and the middle part of his thigh. The anatomical landmarks for these measures were\n\n【57】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1. Endoscopic and histological findings.

We recorded these meas urements during every visit and at the same time of day(i.e.， the patient was scheduled at 13：00 PM and his measure-ments were taken at 13：30 PM).\n\n【61】Practically speaking， we have never seen any significant im-provement in the size of the swelling in the lower limb or in the scrotal area. It seems that the regression of edema in the lower leg was slightly better when coconut oil was applied， but this change was trivial overtime. Notably， the edema was less in the early morning and greater in the evening. The me-chanical maneuvers (e.g.， raising the leg during sleep， mas-sages) were temporarily effective in reducing the edema size.\n\n【62】The diet modification plan was of great benefit in preventing further accumulation of fluids， controlling the loss of enteric proteins， and in preventing susceptibility to infectious agents. The patient was never rehospitalized for any reason up to the time of drafting this article. MCT oils had no important effects on edema size in the long-term management plan for our patient.\n\n【63】Discussion\n\n【64】We performed our literature search in PubMed using the key-words “primary intestinal lymphangiectasia， intestinal lym-phangiectasia， Waldmann's disease， case report\". Feeding the same words into Ovid， Medline， and EBSCO led to the same results. Two hundred and fifteen articles were identified. Two\n\n【65】of the co-authors reviewed the literature separately， and they matched the results. According to our search， the first case report of IL was published in 1965 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Ten articles described IL in animals (nine articles were for a diagnosis of IL in dogs and one in a horse. One paper was a pharmaceutical exper-iment on a guinea pig 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>). The remaining 205 articles de-scribed IL in humans.\n\n【66】The original text was not available for seventeen articles， So they were excluded from our review. The final number of arti-cles included in our review was 188 studies in humans. Figure 3presents a flowchart for our literature search.\n\n【67】The articles were classified as follow：\n\n【68】1\\. Articles described a single case report and its clinical course in a patient.\n\n【69】2\\. Articles presented multiple case reports and its clinical man-ifestations in each patient.\n\n【70】3\\. Articles studied an association between IL and other etiologies.\n\n【71】4\\. Articles dedicated their attention to the complications of IL\n\n【72】5\\. The role of specific treatments in the management of IL was presented in multiple studies； these treatments were： oc-treotide， MCT oil， low fat diet plans， and anti-plasmin.\n\n【73】6\\. Some studies were interested in an investigational means to establish the diagnosis of IL.\n\n【74】Literature search revealed that the age at diagnosis was widely variable. While some cases were diagnosed early in life， others were detected later in life. Age was clearly elucidated in 180/188case reports. Figure 4 present the number of case reports in each age group. The total number of male and female patients included in the reported cases (178/188) was 100 males and 78females. Sporadic IL cases were more prominent； almost 90%of the reported IL cases were of sporadic origin and the rest were of familial susceptibility with a genetic basis.\n\n【75】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4.

The largest number of reported cases were from Europe：84/174 case reports (ltaly 16， UK 15， France 12， Turkey 9； oth-er European countries had less than five cases per country). We found 48/174 case reports for patients from Asia (Japan14， China 13， India 10， Korea 7； other Asian countries had less than two cases per country). In North and South America， the United States had the largest number of reported cases， with23/174. Three cases were reported from Australia， two from Africa and 8/174 were from the Middle East region.\n\n【78】Taking into account the regional and continental population totals， the largest number of reported cases of IL were from countries in Europe， particularly Italy， comprising approximately 50% .\n\n【79】Although in our literature review we cannot point directly to the reason(s) behind the high number of IL cases reported in Europe， on the one hand， we suspect that the medical procedures ap-plied in the countries of the European Union， with regards to health insurance and medical care， covered a more general pop-ulation， and as a result， discovering and reporting a higher num-ber of rare medical conditions should be expected.\n\n【80】On the other hand， considering the population of Asia in 2015was almost more than 60% of the world population， and the small number of reported cases from Asian countries， this makes us think that other factors could be the cause of the high number of the reported cases of IL in Europe； naturally， the possibility of genetic factors comes to mind.\n\n【81】Table 2.

However， these management approaches were of benefit in restricting further extension of the edema， although they were unable to eradicate the existence of the original presenting edema.

The clinical features and presentation at a very early life present immediate intervention. This case series presents successful management of Riga Fede disease associated with neonatal teeth and neonatal teeth alone.\n\n【3】KEYWORDS natal teeth， neonatal teeth\n\n【4】Background\n\n【5】The Riga-Fede disease is a traumatic lesion featured by the pres-ence of ulceration on the lingual surface of the tongue， caused by repetitive injury from natal and neonatal teeth against tongue in neonates. Rigafedes disease was first identified by Italian physician Antonio Riga in 1881， later histological studies of the disease are described by Fede in 1890通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Other terms used to describe rigafede disease are Riga’s dis-ease， eosinophilic granuloma， sublingual ulcer， sublingual gran-uloma and traumatic sublingual ulceration. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> Most of the lesions appear on the lingual surface of the tongue but may oc-cur on lip， palate， gingiva， vestibular mucosa and floor of the mouth.4\\]\n\n【7】Association of neonatal and natal teeth with Riga-Fede dis-ease is proved. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> Few authors have reported the occurrence of rigafedes disease in immunocompromised patients， downs syndrome and microcephaly. These teeth are often called as precocious teeth. Massler and Savara classified precocious teeth into the time of eruption into natal teeth-present at birth， and neonatal teeth erupted after birth (first 30 days of life). 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>\n\n【8】In this case series， we present two cases of rigafedes disease associated with natal teeth and neonatal alone their manage-ment.\n\n【9】Case reports\n\n【10】Case report 1\n\n【11】A 2-week old baby was referred to the Department of dentistry with a complaint of crying and presence of erupting teeth along with white patch below the tongue as presented by the baby's mother. The weight of the child was 3.4 kilograms with satis-factory APGAR score at the time of birth. Mother has reported no discomfort during feeding， but the child was crying during feeding also. Blood picture was normal. Intraoral examination revealed the presence of ulceration on the lingual side of the tongue.通用删除8(英):<u>\\[fig.1\\]</u> There was a single neonatal tooth in the mandibu-lar anterior region with a tissue partially covering it. On pal-pation tooth is mobile. The ulceration is well-circumscribed extending on either side of midline with non-scrabble white patches.\n\n【12】With the consent of parents， removal of neonatal teeth was planned. EMLA was applied on to the soft tissue overgrowth with the help of a cotton applicator. After 5 minutes small gauze piece is placed on to the lingual sulcus to prevent aspiration of the teeth. Tweezer is placed beneath the tooth and squeezed slightly to push the teeth upwards. With the help of Adson’s beaked forceps， the tooth is removed 通用删除8(英):<u>\\[fig.2\\]</u>. Topical application of tranexamic acid is made by depositing it into a gauze. Once bleeding is stopped， the patient is discharged. Topical anaes-thetic gel consisting of benzocaine is advised before feeding， and paracetamol oral drops are advised. Patient reviewed after5days. Healing was satisfactory. 通用删除8(英):<u>\\[Fig. 3\\]</u>\n\n【13】Case report 2：\n\n【14】A 5-week old baby was referred to the Department of dentistry with erupting teeth and white patch adjacent to the teeth. The weight of the child was 4.5 kilograms with satisfactory APGAR score at the time of birth. Mother reported having discomfort during breastfeeding. Blood picture was normal. Intraoral exam-\n\n【15】Fig. 1： Pre-operative.\n\n【16】ination revealed the presence of ulceration on the lingual aspect of the neonatal teeth. There was a presence of single neonatal teeth in the mandibular anterior region with a tissue partially covering it 通用删除8(英):<u>\\[fig 4\\]</u>. On palpation tooth is mobile. The ulceration is well-circumscribed surrounding the teeth. A similar procedure was followed as above， and the tooth is removed. 通用删除8(英):<u>\\[Fig. 5\\]</u>\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】Riga-Fede disease caused by the injury to the lingual tissues by the sharp edges of the teeth and aggravated by the tong ue's movement over it. Repetitive episodes of trauma and secondary infection produces a disc-shaped lesion with a pseudomembrane. It may cause discomfort and pain during feeding.\n\n【19】It is classified based on the onset into the precocious type\n\n【20】Fig.3： Postoperative.\n\n【21】Fig.4： Pre-operative.\n\n【22】Fig. 5： Post-operative.\n\n【23】associated with precocious teeth and late-onset type occurring in about 6-8 months is associated with neurological disorders.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> therefore later could be the first sign for neurological disorders related to self-inflicting diseases like familial dysautonomia， Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or Tourette's syndrome. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>\n\n【24】Various diseases sharing similarities with Riga-Fede disease include infectious diseases such as syphilis， tuberculosis or ulcer-ative candidiasis， and neoplasms such as lymphomas，sarcomas or granular cell myoblastomas. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5， 9\\]</u> most common differentiat-ing feature to recognize candidiasis， these are scrabbled lesions. The histological study can differentiate it from remaining. The Riga-Fede disease consists of ulceration of mucosa with granula-tion tissue and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate with a majority of eosinophils Eliminating the etiological factors and palliative treatment should be done as early as possible. In the present case series， neonatal teeth are responsible for the ulceration of the tongue. Hence the treatment should start with the extraction of these precocious teeth. Failure to treat may lead to dehydration， malnutrition and secondary infection. Risk of aspiration can be seen in precious teeth as there is no root and attached to the soft tissue. Hence the precocious type of rigafede disease first line of treatment should be extraction.\n\n【25】Extraction in a newborn should be done in caution as the pro-duction of vitamin K and prothrombin in the liver， starting from10th day of life. Hence it is advisable to postpone extraction. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> In the present case series， both the extractions were performed in the third week.\n\n【26】Late-onset rigafede disease is caused by the cumulative effect of teeth and concomitant neurological disorders. Hence the treatment should be targeted in reducing the friction from incisal edges of teeth. Topical applications of triamcinolone acetonide act as an anti-inflammatory agent and may help in healing in these cases. Topical anaesthetic agents also provide temporary relief and also protect the lesion. Tomizawa et al. found drifting of adjacent teeth and thereby narrowing space in cases where teeth are extracted at an early stage. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> Hence extraction should be avoided in the late-onset type of rigafede disease.\n\n【27】Conclusion\n\n【28】Riga Fede disease is an inflammatory disease resulting from repetitive trauma of the tongue caused by neonatal or natal tooth or primary teeth. Riga Fede disease needs immediate attention in order to prevent baby from malnutrition and as well as to prevent aspiration of the neonatal or natal teeth. Conservative treatment is preferred if it is associated with primary teeth.\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of interest</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There are no conflicts of interest to declare by any of the authors of this study.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>References</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.

Narghile smoking is rapidly increasing worldwide among young people 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In Turkey， it is gaining popularity as a social activ-ity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Carbon monoxide (CO) exposure is higher in narghile smoking compared to cigarettes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Narghile smoking is a rare cause of CO poisoning. There have been few cases of CO poisoning associated with the use of narghiles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，4-7\\]</u>.\n\n【29】In this report， we describe a patient presenting to our Emergency Department (ED) with nausea， dizziness， vertigo， and syncope resulting from CO poisoning after narghile smoking.\n\n【30】Case Report\n\n【31】A 27-year-old man was brought by ambulance to our ED be-cause of nausea， dizziness， vertigo and syncope. He was con-scious when he arrived at the ED.\n\n【32】Physical examination results were normal， and he had no past medical history of note. There were no focal neurological signs or cranial nerve deficits.\n\n【33】His vital signs were within normal limits： blood pressure， 125/70mmHg； pulse rate， 79 beats/min； temperature， 36.8℃； SpO。97%； and Glasgow Coma Scale score， 15. His biochemical mark-ers and electrocardiographies (ECG) were normal.\n\n【34】Further history exploration revealed that he had smoked a narghile in a house for 3-4 hours. We suspected CO poison-ing and measured his arterial blood gas. His carboxyhemoglo bin (COHb) level was 32.6%. He was immediately transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)， and 100% normobaric oxy-gen by a non-rebreather mask was applied. The patient had normal biochemical examinations results， including complete blood count， electrolytes， and cardiac enzymes. At the 6th hour of treatment， his COHb level was decreased to 9.1%， and at discharge it was 1.0%. His ECG did not show any change. His echocardiography and CT scan of the brain revealed normal findings. At the 2nd day of admission， the patient was asymp-tomatic and was discharged home with complete recovery.\n\n【35】Discussion\n\n【36】Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless， odorless， and non-ir-ritating gas that is produced by incomplete combustion of\n\n【37】hydrocarbons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In Turkey， the main sources of CO poison-ing are charcoal stoves and water heaters.\n\n【38】The smoke from a narghile contains toxic chemicals such as CO， polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons， and volatile aldehydes. It can lead to many chronic diseases including cardiovascu-lar disease， lung cancer， chronic obstructive pulmonary dis ease， and asthma. Moreover， it is associated with the spread of communicable diseases (such as herpes and tuberculo-sis) and CO poisoning 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Narghile smoking is an uncommon cause of CO poisoning.\n\n【39】Carbon monoxide is readily absorbed by the lungs， and com-petes with oxygen for binding to hemoglobin. The affinity of hemoglobin for CO is 200-250 times greater than its affinity for oxygen， so oxygen is displaced from hemoglobin， and car-boxyhemoglobin forms. This results in inhibition of oxygen release， reduced oxygen delivery， and subsequent tissue hy-poxia. CO binds to receptors of the cytochrome oxidase sys-tem， resulting in hypoxia at the cellular level. CO exposure has been shown to cause the production of free oxygen radicals and lipid peroxidation. Hypoxia may be followed by reoxygen-ation and reperfusion injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【40】CO poisoning can present with a wide range of clinical symp-toms. The most common symptoms of CO poisoning include headache， dizziness， nausea， vomiting，confusion， fatigue，chest pain， shortness of breath， and loss of consciousness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，11\\]</u>. The diagnosis of CO poisoning is difficult because of its non-specific symptoms； thus， COHb should be investigated in sus-pected patients. There is no direct relationship between COHb levels and clinical effects， but it is generally accepted that an initial level of greater than 15% suggests significant toxicity. Our patient was diagnosed with CO poisoning based on the information from his friends and on his increased COHb level.\n\n【41】The main purpose of treatment is to maintain hemodynam-ic stabilization and elimination of the CO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The standard treatment for CO poisoning is administration of high-flow ox-ygen， either hyperbaric oxygen therapy or normobaric oxygen therapy. In our case， 100% oxygen treatment was applied by a non-rebreather mask.\n\n【42】Conclusions\n\n【43】This case demonstrates that a detailed anamnesis is the most crucial factor for the diagnosis of CO poisoning. In our case， CO poisoning was suspected from the patient’s nonspecific symptoms and his narghile smoking anamnesis. The diagno-sis was confirmed by his increased COHb level.\n\n【44】This report received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public， commercial， or not-for-profit sectors.\n\n【45】References：\n\n【46】1\\.

Rectal GIST is a rare disease. Imatinib with curative resection is the cornerstone for the management of the disease. METHODOLOGY：It's a retrospective case series of two patients treated at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre(SKMCH & RC). RESULTS： Two patients presented at SKMCH & RC with history of perianal pain. Diagnostic workup was performed. MRI showed rectal mass which was confirmed as rectal GIST on biopsy. CD117 was positive in both cases. A metastatic workup was negative. One patient received neoadjuvant imatinib， and the other underwent upfront surgery. Both patients received adjuvant imatinib. One patient with closed resection margin had recurrence after five years of treatment. She underwent surgical resection for recurrence. Both of the patients are now alive without disease. CONCLUSION： Although this data is first to be reported from this part of the world， however， due to the small number of reported patients， this study cannot be used as a guideline for the management of disease\n\n【4】KEYWORDS Gastrointestinal stromal tumors， Gastrointestinal stromal tumor of rectum， Rare cancer of rectum， GIST，Rare site of GIST\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】The term Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) was coined in1983 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

Majority of the times， radical surgery is indicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6， 7\\]</u>. However， some cases were reported that were treated with local excision of the tumour 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In the last 20 years， 271 patients with a primary diagnosis of GIST were registered at our institution. Two patients (0.73%) had a primary diagnosis of GIST. We report two cases of anorectal GIST who were treated primarily with surgical resection.\n\n【15】CASE DISCUSSIONS：\n\n【16】Case 1\n\n【17】Thirty-six years old presented in the outpatient department with a history of abdominal discomfort and mass in the perianal re-gion for the last 12 months. She had no history of addiction. She had no comorbidities and denied any family history of cancer. Abdominal examination was unremarkable. Digital rectal exam-ination (DRE) was performed， which showed circumferential\n\n【18】stenosing rectal growth palpable at the anal verge. Histopathol-ogy slides showed interlacing fascicles and whorls of uniform elongated cells with cigar-shaped vesicular nuclei with perinu-clear hallo. The nuclei show mild to moderate pleomorphism with eosinophilic cytoplasm. A mitotic count of 26 mitoses/50HPF's is noted. Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for CD 34 and CD 117 thus confirming GIST. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed the large well defined lobulated tumour in the anal canal region， which is projecting outside the lumen posteriorly. It measures around 68mm in maximum di-mension. No lymphadenopathy was appreciated. A metastatic workup was performed， which was negative. The patient was discussed in the multi-disciplinary team (MDT) meeting； the recommendations were to perform upfront surgical resection. Laparoscopic conventional abdominoperineal resection (APR) was performed. Operative findings werelarge tumour involving Left side of anal canal up to 5cm， protruding into the rectum and also involving posterior wall of the vagina with intact mucosa， it is also extending into Left ischiorectal fossa. No liver or peri-toneal metastasis， no ascites. Blood loss 70 ml and the duration of surgery was 195 minutes. The patient was discharged on 5th day of surgery. Histological analyses of APR specimen showed that the size of the tumour was 69 mm. The tumour was involv-ing the circumferential resection margin. Mitotic rate was 28/50HPFs. The stage of the tumour was T3N0. She was started on imatinib 400 mg after surgery and took adjuvant treatment for one year.\n\n【19】通用删除16(英):<u>FIGURE 4A： Histological image of GIST of rectum</u>\n\n【20】On surveillance， MRI performed showing local disease re-lapse after five years of completion of treatment. There was interval development of multiple heterogeneous signal intensity masses in pelvis. The largest mass in a rectouterine pouch， dis-placing the vaginal canal anteriorly is extending laterally into the left ischiorectal fossa measures 5.5x4.9 cm. Per-vaginal ex-amination revealed a palpable hard mass at the posterior vaginal wall， consistent with disease recurrence. The patient was again discussed in MDT and the recommendations were to continue imatinib and then perform surgery. Hysterectomy with excision of the recurrent mass was removed in a second surgery. Histol-ogy confirmed recurrent GIST. Imatinib was resumed after one month of surgery. She has been followed up for two years and still on imatinib. She is clinically and radiologically disease-free on surveillance.\n\n【21】Case 2\n\n【22】A sixty-six-year-old male presented in the outpatient department with a history of painful bleeding per rectum and altered bowel habit for two years. He was a known case of hypertension. He was an ex-smoker. His baseline labs were within normal range. Carcinoembryonic level (CEA) was 1.86 ng/ml. On examination， the abdominal examination was unremarkable， although DRE showed non-stenosing tumour starting at 3 cm from the anal verge. On colonoscopy it was an eccentric polypoid tumour， beginning at 4 cm from the anal verge，extending proximally to10 cm. MRI scan revealed large enhancing mass involving the rectum and mesorectal fat without pelvic lymphadenopathy. A metastatic workup was negative. Biopsy showed GIST. MDT recommended neoadjuvant chemotherapy imatinib and then assessment for surgery. He received imatinib for four months. Laparoscopic Hartman procedure was performed. Duration of surgery was 300 minutes， and blood loss was 30ml. There was no complication during surgery. He was discharged on 5th post-operative day. Histopathology showed microscopic foci of GIST\n\n【23】with therapy-induced changes， and all the resection margins were free of tumour. CD 117 and DOG 1 were found positive. He was then again started on imatinib after surgery. He was followed up for one year. There was neither local recurrence nor distant metastases on suryeillance CT scan.\n\n【24】Discussion\n\n【25】Due to the rarity of the disease， some case reports and case series have been published. We are reporting two cases that were presented to our hospital. Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre (SKMCH & RC) is the only dedicated cancer center of Pakistan. We accept patients from all over Pakistan. Previous case reports demonstrate male predominance通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. However， in our study， one of the patients was male； the other was a female. Mean age at diagnosis was51 years. Majority of the patients with anorectal GIST present in their fifth to seventh decades of life. Most of the patients present with rectal mass， perianal pain， rectal fullness， rectal bleeding or signs of obstruction. None of the patients in this study presented with signs of obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. They either noticed a mass in the anal canal or per rectal bleeding.\n\n【26】GIST cells lead to pathological activation of Kit-tyrosine-kinase， which results in aberrant cellular proliferation and re-sistance to apoptosis. GIST expresses CD117 in up to 95% and CD34 in up to 70% of the cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Both of our cases express CD117， while the patient had CD34 positive tumour. As GIST predominantly affects stomach and duodenum， anorectal GIST accounts for 5% of all GISTs. The percentage of rectal GIST from our hospital is 0.73%. However， it is not the true representative from Pakistan.\n\n【27】GISTs with the invasion of adjacent organs or distant metas-tases on imaging are marked as Malignant GISTs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. However， the widely accepted criteria for identifying malignant GIST is the mitotic activity (5mitosis/50HPF) and tumour size greater than 5 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Both of our patients had rectal GISTs of malignant nature. As this disease is extremely rare，there are no standard guidelines available for the management of rectal GIST. Local excision can be performed in patients with low mitotic rate and smaller tumour (<2cm) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>； however， patients with larger tu-mour size and high mitotic rate should be managed with radical surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. We treated our patients with radical excision. One patient developed local recurrence five years after the treatment. However， she is in remission after recurrence. The second pa-tient underwent Hartman's procedure； he is still free of any local recurrence or distant metastases. There is reported role of either chemotherapy or radiotherapy in the management of the disease通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，11\\]</u>. Imatinib， a tyrosine kinase inhibitor， has been used as adjuvant therapy in the previously published literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12， 13\\]</u>. The published literature is scarce regarding the role of neoad-juvant imatinib in the management of anorectal GIST. It can be beneficial in downstaging the burden of disease， which has the advantage of better organ preservation. In our case study， one patient received neoadjuvant imatinib which resulted in decreasing the burden of disease.\n\n【28】Conclusion\n\n【29】Rectal GIST is a rare disease. Better management of the disease can be achieved with radical surgery and imatinib. Although this data is first to be reported from this part of the world， however， due to the small number of reported patients， this study cannot be used as a guideline for the management of the disease.\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Conflict of interest</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There are no conflicts of interest to declare by any of the authors of this study.</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Ethical Approval</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Due to the retrospective nature of the study， the exemption was granted from the Institutional Review Board of Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre.</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Authors Contributions</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>·Dr. Ihtisham Ul Haq (IUH)- Study lead and manuscript writing.</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>·Dr. Osama Shakeel (OS)-Study lead， Study concept and manuscript writing.</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>·Dr.Abdul Wahid Anwer (AWA)-Data collection and manuscript review.</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>·Dr. Aun Jamal Gill (AJG)-Study concept.</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>·Dr. Irfan Bashir (IB)- Collection of histological images</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>·Dr. Muhammad Fahd Shah (MFS) - Supervision of manuscript</u>\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>·Dr. Hannan Ali (HA)-Data collection and analyses (where indicated)</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>·Dr. Shahid Khattak (SHK)-Supervision of manuscript.</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>· Dr. Aamir Ali Syed (DAAS)-Supervision of manuscript.</u>\n\n【44】通用结尾删除-1:<u>References</u>\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>1\\.
