OHS can lead to pulmonary hypertension. It has not been clearly demonstrated that OHS with pulmonary hypertension can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and right heart failure. A case is presented of right ventricular dysfunction and right ventricular failure secondary to OHS.\n\n【16】Case Report：\n\n【17】A 53-year-old man， who was morbidly obese with a BMl of 75 kg/m， presented with shortness of breath (SOB) and hypercapnia. He had never smoked but had a history of severe OSA and hypertension. On examination， the patient was obese with normal lung auscultation and mild pitting edema of the lower extremities. A spi-ral computed tomography (CT) angiogram showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism or interstitial lung dis-ease. Pulmonary function testing showed no obstructive airway disease and a normal diffusion capacity. Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed normal left ventricular function and a dilated right ventricle (RV) with a flattened septal wall， moderate tricuspid regurgitation， and an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 55-60 mmHg. The patient was discharged on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and oxygen at night， and as needed during the day.\n\n【18】Conclusions：\n\n【19】This report has shown that OHS without underlying causes of alveolar hypoventilation can result in isolated right ventricular dysfunction and right ventricular failure.\n\n【20】MeSH Keywords： Heart Failure· Hypertension， Pulmonary·Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome\n\n【21】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/918395\n\n【22】日22124 盟2 山司\n\n【23】2\n\n【24】全国17\n\n【25】Population data from the US between 2011 and 2014 showed that 37% of adults were obese， with a body mass index (BMI) of >30 kg/m² \\[1\\]. Up to 30% of severely obese hospitalized pa-tients with a BMI 235 kg/m? have been reported to have hy-poventilation syndrome (OHS) \\[2\\]. It is important to recognize this condition， as patients with OHS with a BMI 235 kg/m²who are hospitalized are reported to have a one-year survival of only80%\\[2\\]. Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is characterized by a body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m?， daytime hypercapnia， an arterial carbon dioxide tension 245 mmHg， and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) \\[3\\]. OHS can lead to pulmonary hyperten-sion and right ventricular failure， but right ventricular hyper-trophy can be associated with preserved cardiac function \\[3\\].\n\n【26】Due to the obesity epidemic in the US， OHS is now likely to be the second most common cause of chronic hypercapnia seen clinically， with the most common cause being chronic obstruc-tive pulmonary disease (COPD)， with interstitial lung disease being less common. Advanced neuromuscular diseases， such as muscular dystrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis can result in hypercapnia resulting in the need for ventilatory sup-port. Patients who suffer from a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) may also develop chronic hypercapnia and need ventilatory support. All these patients with advanced neuromuscular dis-ease will need a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and tracheostomy before placement in a long-term care facility.\n\n【27】Isolated right ventricular dysfunction with or without right ven-tricular failure can occur with COPD， chronic thromboembol-ic pulmonary hypertension， acute pulmonary embolism， and chronic lung disease other than COPD that results in hypox-emia. However， it remains unclear whether or not OHS alone can cause isolated right ventricular dysfunction and right ven-tricular failure. This report is of a case of OHS and isolated right ventricular dysfunction with right ventricular failure.\n\n【28】Case Report\n\n【29】A 53-year-old man， who was morbidly obese with a BMl of75 kg/m?， presented with shortness of breath (SOB) and hy-percapnia. He had never smoked but had a history of hyper-tension and severe obstructive sleep apnea with an apnea-hy-popnea index (AHI) >30 per hour. There was no known family history of cardiac disease， and the patient did not have a his-tory of syncope.\n\n【30】On examination， his blood pressure was 132/83 mmHg， and he had a regular pulse of 98 bpm， a respiratory rate of 20breaths/minute， a temperature of 98.7°F， with oxygen satura-tion (SaO，) of 88% on room air.

The findings were in keeping with left ventricular hypertrophy with a normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)， severe right ventricle (RV) dilatation and dysfunction， left and right atrial enlargement， and moderate pulmonary hypertension.\n\n【42】Chest computed tomography (CT) showed normal lung paren-chyma without pulmonary embolism. Two-dimensional trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed normal left ventricular function and a dilated right ventricle (RV) with a flattened sep-tal wall (1.3 cm in diameter)， moderate tricuspid regurgitation，\n\n【43】an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 55-60 mmHg， right and left atrial dilatation， mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy， and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50%(Figure 1). The right ventricle was severely dilated and dysfunc-tional (Figure 2). There was moderate tricuspid regurgitation(max. velocity 303 cm/sec) with an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) of 55-60 mmHg (Table 2). Pulse-wave tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) of the anterior and posterior mitral annulus showed abnormal left ventricle relaxation. The patient was discharged on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and oxygen at night， and as needed during the day.\n\n【44】Discussion\n\n【45】The gold standard diagnostic procedure for the identification of pulmonary hypertension is right heart catheterization， with pulmonary hypertension defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) 220 mmHg \\[6\\]. Four studies have used right heart catheterization to demonstrate the presence of pulmo-nary hypertension in patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) \\[7-10\\]. Sugerman et al. identified pulmo-nary hypertension in 23/26 patients with OHS \\[7\\]. However， only nine patients (34.6%) had pulmonary hypertension with-out left heart dysfunction. Kessler et al. studied 34 patients with OHS， 29 had right heait catheterization， 17 patients(59%) had pulmonary hypertension， but only 19/181 (10.5%) with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) alone had pulmonary hy-pertension \\[8\\]. There was no difference in cardiac output de-termined by thermodilution between patients with OHS and those with isolated OSA \\[8\\]. Kauppert et al. performed right heart catheterization in 21 patients with OHS and found pul-monary hypertension in 17/21 (81%) patients \\[9\\]. However， three patients had postcapillary pulmonary hypertension， and14/21 (66.7%) had pulmonary hypertension not related to left heart failure \\[9\\]. Held et al. identified 12 patients with OHS， but three patients also had chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-ease (COPD) that complicated the clinical presentation \\[10\\]. Therefore， nine patients with OHS had pulmonary hyperten-sion (defined as a mean PAP 225 mmHg) by right heart cathe-terization \\[10\\]. All patients had normal left ventricular function， although the average data from 17 patients who underwent right heart catheterization were presented， and patients with OHS and pulmonary hypertension were not analyzed in isola-tion \\[10\\]. These four previously published clinical studies sup-port that pulmonary hypertension secondary to OHS occurs in some patients without left heart failure， COPD， interstitial lung disease， or other causes \\[7-10\\].\n\n【46】Although right heart catheterization is the best way to deter-mine the presence of pulmonary hypertension， transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) provides an estimate of the presence or absence of pulmonary hypertension \\[6，11\\]. A large study\n\n【47】by Almeneessier et al. investigated 77 patients with OHS who were screened for the presence of pulmonary hypertension with TTE \\[3\\]. In this previous study， pulmonary hypertension was defined as a pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP)>40 mmHg \\[3\\]. Fifty-three (68.8%) out of 77 patients had pul-monary hypertension， and none had prior treatment with non-invasive ventilation \\[3\\]. In this previously published study， the body mass index (BMI) was 43.2+10.4 kg/m? and the average age was 60.5±11.7 years \\[3\\]. The study showed that pulmo-nary hypertension is common in patients with OHS who have not been treated with noninvasive ventilation when initially screened by TTE \\[3\\]. These previous studies using TTE in screen-ing for pulmonary hypertension in OHS are consistent with the right heart catheterization data and show that pulmonary hy-pertension can occur in the absence of left ventricular failure.\n\n【48】The use of the apical four-chamber view in TTE to diagnose pulmonary hypertension measures tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV) and reflects the difference in pressure between the right atrium (RA) and the right ventricle (RV)\\[6\\]. Assuming that there is no pulmonary stenosis， the right ventricular Sys-tolic pressure (RVSP) is assumed to be equivalent to the pul-monary artery systolic pressure (PASP) and can be calculat-ed from the Bernoulli equation using an estimated right atrial pressure determined from an inferior vena cava echocardio-gram (Table 3) \\[6\\]. The Bernoulli equation is as follows：RVSP=4(TRV)+estimated RA pressure\n\n【49】RVSP=PASP in the absence of pulmonary stenosis\n\n【50】A PASP >40 mmHg is consistent with a mean PAP >25 mmHg. A mean PAP of ≥25 mmHg is currently defined as pulmonary hypertension \\[6\\]. However， a PASP>40 mmHg is a conserva-tive value， and an even lower PASP may be consistent with pulmonary hypertension but may risk overdiagnosis (false pos-itives) and is used less often. However， right heart catheter-ization measures the mean PAP directly and is the gold stan-dard for diagnosing pulmonary hypertension.\n\n【51】The case in the present report had pulmonary hypertension with normal left ventricular function， and a brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) of 160 pg/ml. The patient had never smoked. The spiral computed tomography (CT) angiogram showed no evidence of pulmonary embolic disease or interstitial lung disease， and pulmonary function tests showed no obstruc-tive or restrictive lung disease. However， the patient did have moderate pulmonary hypertension on TTE， with right ventric-ular dysfunction and right ventricular dilation. Right ventric-ular dysfunction and ventricular failure manifested clinical-ly as bilateral leg edema. We believe this to be a rare case of OHS with resultant pulmonary hypertension that resulted in right ventricular dysfunction and mild right ventricular failure.\n\n【52】An underlying mechanism for pulmonary hypertension second-ary to OHS is chronic nocturnal and diurnal hypoxemia， hyper-capnia， and acidosis that leads to chronic vascular constric tion and vascular remodeling \\[12，13\\]. Also， patients with OHS have increased upper airway resistance and reduced respira-tory compliance \\[4\\]. In some patients， these factors may re-sult in a significant effort to breathe， resulting in hypercapnia and hypoxemia that also promote recurrent pulmonary arterial vasoconstriction， vascular remodeling， and pulmonary arteri-al hypertension \\[4\\]. Previous studies have shown that OSA re-sults in right ventricular dysfunction \\[14-16\\]. The Framingham study evaluated sleep-disordered breathing in patients with a BMI of 32+5 kg/m² compared with those without sleep-dis-ordered breathing \\[14\\]. The study found a small but signifi-cant increase in right ventricular wall thickness \\[14\\]. However， right atrial and right ventricular dimensions and right ventricu-lar systolic function were no different than in the controls， and there was no clinical right ventricular failure \\[14\\].\n\n【53】Dorsunoglu et al. used a complex myocardial performance in-dex (MPI) and compared subjects with mild or moderate OSA compared with normal controls \\[15\\]. All subjects， patients and normal controls， had normal left ventricular systolic function as determined by measurement of the ejection fraction \\[15\\].Those patients with moderate OSA had an increased left and right MPI compared with the normal controls and compared with mild OSA \\[15\\]. No patients had clinical symptoms of ventricular fail-ure or clinical heart failure \\[15\\]. The right ventricular diastolic diameter in all subjects was normal and varied from 9 mm to30 mm \\[15\\]. This finding was in contrast to the finding in the patient in this report who had a markedly enlarged right ventric-ular diastolic diameter of 78 mm (Table 2). Romero-Correl et al. also used the same MPl index and compared normal patients with patients with mild OSA and moderate to severe OSA \\[16\\]. The patients with moderate to severe OSA when compared with controls had an increased right and left MPl index， consistent with right and left cardiac dysfunction， despite normal left ven-tricular systolic function measured by the ejection fraction \\[16\\]. The patients did not have clinical symptoms of heart failure \\[16\\]. An additional finding was an increased left atrial volume index consistent with diastolic dysfunction that was present in the OSA patients and not present in normal controls \\[16\\]. The patient in the present case report also had diastolic dysfunction， which was probably secondary to his systemic hypertension. These latter three studies showed that subclinical right ventricular dysfunc-tion could occur without clinical heart failure in patients with OSA \\[14-16\\]. However， the patient in the present case report also had OHS and would be expected to have more severe and prolonged pulmonary hypertension， which would be more like-ly to result in right ventricular failure over time.\n\n【54】disease on pulmonary function testing \\[17\\]. Left ventricular function were evaluated in at least 39 patients， with right ventricular function evaluated in 25 patients \\[17\\]. Left and right ventricular dysfunction was found in some patients \\[17\\]. However， it was unclear whether there were patients with right ventricular dysfunction who did not have left ventricular dys-function \\[17\\]. Also， pulmonary embolic disease and intersti-tial lung disease could not be completely excluded by spiral CT angiography and non-contrast-enhanced CT， respectively \\[17\\]. Therefore， in this previous study， there was no clear cut evi-dence to support the presence of right ventricular dysfunction due to OHS and pulmonary hypertension \\[17\\]\n\n【55】Conclusions\n\n【56】This case report has shown that obesity hypoventilation syn-drome (OHS) with pulmonary hypertension， without obstructive\n\n【57】References：\n\n【58】1\\.

However， se-vere starvation ketoacidosis is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication that can occur postopera-tively in patients with T2DM. Despite the increasing prevalence of these surgeries， the existing literature has limited information on severe starvation ketoacidosis as a postoperative complication. It is essential for health-care professionals to be aware of this complication， its manifestations， and risk factors to ensure patient safe-ty and improve outcomes. Therefore， this article aims to address the current gap in the literature and provide a comprehensive review of severe starvation ketoacidosis as a postoperative complication of bariatric surger-ies， specifically OAGB， and its associated risk factors and manifestations.\n\n【25】Case Report： A 38-year-old man with severe obesity and inadequately managed T2DM underwent OAGB surgery. On the second postoperative day， the patient experienced severe starvation ketoacidosis， exhibiting symptoms such as drowsiness， fatigue， weakness， and Kussmaul breathing. Blood gas analysis indicated significant metabol-ic acidosis. He was quickly transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and given intravenous glucose and in-sulin therapy. Following this intervention， he showed rapid recovery and normalization of blood gases. He was discharged 6 days after surgery with normal clinical examination results and laboratory indices.\n\n【26】Conclusions：\n\n【27】This case study emphasizes the significance of thorough preoperative glycemic control，comprehensive peri-operative multidisciplinary management， and close postoperative monitoring for diabetic patients undergoing metabolic and bariatric surgeries. By implementing these strategies， healthcare professionals can reduce the risk of complications such as hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia/diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and enhance patient outcomes. The case also highlights the need for continuous education and training for healthcare providers to identify and manage such rare complications effectively\n\n【28】Keywords： Bariatric Surgery· Starvation\n\n【29】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/939581\n\n【30】Publisher's note： All daims expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of their affiliated MP organizations， or those of the publisher the editors and the reviewers.

However， diabetic ke-toacidosis (DKA) is a rare but potentially life-threatening com-plication following these procedures. DKA is typically charac-terized by hyperglycemia， acidosis， and ketonuria， and its risk factors and manifestations vary across patients. In the current literature， there is limited information about the occurrence of DKA after metabolic and bariatric surgery， particularly in the context of severe starvation ketoacidosis. Starvation ketoaci-dosis can result from prolonged fasting or inadequate caloric intake \\[3-7\\] and adds an additional layer of complexity to the management of postoperative complications. This case report presents a unique instance of severe starvation ketoacidosis in a patient with T2DM following one anastomosis gastric by-pass (OAGB) surgery， adding valuable insights to the existing knowledge on this rare complication.\n\n【32】Case Report\n\n【33】A 38-year-old man with severe obesity (weight 113 kg， height177 cm， body mass index 36.1) and a history of type-2 diabe-tes mellitus (T2DM) was scheduled for a one anastomosis gas-tric bypass (OAGB). He was diagnosed with T2DM 8 years pri-or and was prescribed daily Glucophage treatment combined with insulin therapy. Unfortunately， he was non-compliant with insulin therapy and adhered only to daily Glucophage treat-ment. Consequently， his glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) level reached 13.2% 2 months before surgery. Due to his uncon-trolled diabetes and low compliance with prescribed medical treatments， the endocrinologist recommended bariatric sur-gery to achieve better diabetes control.\n\n【34】A preoperative workup revealed mild gastroesophageal reflux and fatty liver. Apart from T2DM， the endocrinological evalua-tion was unremarkable. The patient was advised to maintain a normal diet before surgery but reported a low-calorie intake for several days preoperatively.\n\n【35】The OAGB surgery was uneventful， and the patient was hydrated with intravenous normal saline supplemented with potassium chloride postoperatively. As in every surgical procedure requir-ing fasting， his oral anti-diabetic agents were suspended dur-ing the postoperative fasting period， and glycemic levels were closely monitored. On postoperative day 2 (POD2)， he exhibit-ed drowsiness， fatigue， and weakness， with Kussmaul breath-ing， but no abdominal tenderness. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed severe metabolic acidosis (pH 7.104， HCO3 7 mmol/L)， while blood glucose was 161 mg/dL， and urinalysis showed ke-tones (+++).Other laboratory values were within normal limits， including electrolytes， blood count， and renal function (Table 1).\n\n【36】The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for in-travenous glucose and insulin treatment， rapidly recovering and with normalizing blood gases. Six days after surgery， he was discharged home， feeling well and with normal clinical and laboratory findings (Table 2).\n\n【37】Discussion\n\n【38】High anion gap metabolic acidosis can be primarily attributed to 5 causes： ketoacidosis， lactic acidosis， ingestions， renal fail-ure， and massive rhabdomyolysis \\[8\\]. Ketoacidosis can be in-duced by uncontrolled diabetes mellitus， alcohol consumption， or fasting. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus is the most common cause of ketoacidosis， almost always presenting with hyper-glycemia consisting of blood glucose concentration exceeding250 mg/dL and usually much higher \\[9，10\\].\n\n【39】Table 1. Blood gas analysis during postoperative days 2 to 5. Note the marked metabolic acidosis and the gradual restitution to normal pH after initiation glucose and insulin therapy.\n\n|  | POD2  | +4h  | +8h  | +12 h  | +16 h  | +20 h  | +24h  | +48 h  | +72 h  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| pH  | 7.105  | 7.153  | 7.208  | 7.223  | 7.267  | 7.29  | 7.35  | 7.39  | 7.404  |\n| PCO2 (mmHg)  | 22.7  | 22.9  | 29.7  | 24.6  | 26.6  | 28.6  | 29.7  | 34  | 39.5  |\n| HC03 (mmol/L)  | 7  | 7.9  | 11.6  | 9.9  | 11.9  | 13.7  | 16.1  | 20.2  | 24  |\n| s02(%)  | 97  | 96  | 95  | 96  | 94  | 95  | 94  | 97  | 96  |\n| Base excess (mosmol/L)  | \\-22  | \\-20.9  | \\-16.4  | \\-17.8  | \\-15.1  | \\-12.7  | \\-9.5  | \\-4.8  | \\-0.6  |\n| Glucose (mg/dL)  | 186  | 159  | 181  | 96  | 150  | 185  | 177  | 190  | 185  |\n| Sodium (mmol/L)  | 130  | 135  | 135  | 137  | 139  | 136  | 139  | 139  | 139  |\n| Potassium (mmol/L)  | 4.58  | 4.28  | 4.05  | 3.91  | 3.33  | 4.61  | 4.70  | 4.46  | 4.33  |\n\n| POD Clinical events Blood analysis Treatment  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Day 1  | \\-Surgery uneventful \\- Patient stable after surgery  |  | \\- I hydration (normal saline+KCI)  |\n| Day 2  | \\- Patient drowsy， fatigued， weak \\- Kussmaul breathing observed \\-No abdominal tenderness  |  | \\- Initiation of glucose andinsulin therapy  |\n| Day 3  |  | \\- Blood gas analysis (pH 7.267， HCO311.9 mmol/L， etc.)  | \\- Continued glucose and insulintherapy  |\n| Day 4  | \\- Patient fully recuperated  | \\- Blood gas analysis (pH 7.35， HCO316.1 mmol/L， etc.)  | \\-Continued glucose and insulintherapy  |\n| Day 5  | \\- Patient fully recuperated， bloodgases normalized  | \\- Blood gas analysis (pH 7.39， HCO320.2 mmol/L，etc.)  | \\-Continued glucose and insulintherapy  |\n| Day 6  | \\- Patient discharged， feeling well，normal lab indices  |  |  |\n\n【42】In this case， the patient presented with normal blood lactate lev-els， normal kidney functions， no signs or history of ingestions， and normal blood CPK levels. These parameters and the docu-mented high level of urine ketones point toward ketoacidosis. The patient's blood glucose levels remained under 200 mg/dL during admission and were uneventful the first 2 days after sur-gery， suggesting starvation ketoacidosis as the leading diagnosis.\n\n【43】Overproduction of ketoacids， leading to metabolic acidosis， re-quires both an insulin deficiency-associated increase in the de-livery of fatty acids to the liver due to enhanced lipolysis and a resetting of hepatocyte function so that free fatty acids are preferentially converted to ketoacids rather than triglycerides， caused by excess glucagon \\[11\\]. The lack of carbohydrate in-take associated with starvation can establish the appropriate hormonal settings， low insulin， and high glucagon， leading to ketosis \\[12\\]. However， unlike the severe ketoacidosis that can occur in uncontrolled diabetes， the blood level of ketoacids is usually limited with fasting， potentially due to the promotion of insulin secretion by ketonemia， resulting in limited avail-ability of free fatty acids \\[9\\]. In obese patients， these regula-tory mechanisms are often deranged \\[4，12\\].\n\n【44】Our patient developed severe starvation ketoacidosis 2 days after surgery. He was maintained on IV normal saline with potassium chloride without carbohydrate supplements while\n\n【45】Reterences：\n\n【46】1\\. De Luca M， Piatto G， Merola G， et al.

A potential explanation for this rapid and acute course is the patient's preoperative HbA1C level of 13.2%，which sug-gests ongoing uncontrolled diabetes mellitus， likely with both type 1 and type 2 components. Elevated glucagon secretion following surgery and fasting challenged the chronic low in-sulin levels and exhausted glycogen stores. In this case， aug-mented insulin secretion could not be produced in response to ketonemia， resulting in uncontrolled severe ketoacidosis.\n\n【49】Conclusions\n\n【50】This case report emphasizes the crucial need for careful peri-operative management of diabetic patients undergoing one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) surgery， with particular at-tention given to the prevention and early recognition of severe starvation ketoacidosis. Good glycemic control preoperative-ly and close monitoring in the immediate postoperative peri-od are necessary to prevent severe metabolic derangements. The involvement of a multidisciplinary team， including endo-crinologists， dieticians， and surgical teams， is essential to op-timize outcomes and prevent severe complications. This re-port serves as a reminder of the importance of preoperative counseling and tailored management to mitigate the risks as-sociated with metabolic and bariatric surgery.\n\n【51】3\\.

METHODS： A retrospective case review was performed. RESULTS： A 43-year-old female， presented with altered bowel habits， bleeding per rectal and loss of weight for the last ten months. CT scan performed， which showed a mass in the sigmoid colon， which was confirmed as adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon on endoscopic biopsy. Laparoscopic-assisted anterior resection was performed. Following smooth recovery， she was discharged on 5th post-operative day. Post-operative day 9th， she presented in the emergency room with abdominal pain， then the CT scan was performed， which showed thrombus involving superior mesenteric vein and portal vein. She was managed conservatively with anticoagulation. CONCLUSION： The published literature is scarce regarding this complication (portal vein and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis) associated with laparoscopic colonic resections. As the world is moving towards more minimally invasive procedures， medical professionals will encounter unknown complications.\n\n【5】KEYWORDS Laparoscopic resection， anterior resection， complications of minimally invasive surgery complications of laparoscopic surgery，rare complication\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a rare entity. Myeloproliferative disease， intra-abdominal infection or inflammation， septicemia， cirrhosis， intra-abdominal surgery， trauma， hypercoagulative states， oral contraceptives and primary or secondary liver malig-nancies are the most common etiological factors for portal vein thrombosis \\[1\\].\n\n【8】A Swedish study showed； Out of 23，796 autopsies， only 254autopsies had portal vein thrombosis which constitutes 1% of\n\n【9】Copyright @ 2020 by the Bulgarian Association of Young Surgeons\n\n【10】DOI：10.5455/IJMRCR.laparoscopic-anterior-resection-osama\n\n【11】First Received： May 12， 2020Accepted： July 03， 2020Associate Editor： lvan Inkov (BG)1Surgical Oncology Dept 7 A block R 3 Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital\n\n【12】Johar Town Lahore.

The study revealed that 28% had cir-rhosis， 23% had primary hepatobiliary malignancies，44% had secondary hepatobiliary malignancies， and 3% had myeloprolif-erative disorders \\[2-4J.\n\n【14】Colorectal cancer is the 3rd most common malignant neo-plasm \\[5\\]. The incidence of it is on the rise \\[6， 7\\]. Surgery remains the mainstay of treatment. Open surgery has been the standard for decades. However， now the trend has shifted towards mini-mally invasive techniques， with advantages of shorter length of stay (LOS)， less pain and earlier recovery of bowel function \\[8，9J.\n\n【15】Laparoscopic colectomy provides favourable outcomes with an acceptable complication rate. Portal vein thrombosis and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis are rare complications asso-ciated with laparoscopic colonic resection for carcinoma， with ex-act physiology yet to be established. This is a rare phenomenon after a laparoscopic resection with some case reports published highlighting the complication. We present a case report of portal\n\n【16】vein thrombosis after laparoscopic anterior resection for sigmoid colon carcinoma.\n\n【17】CASE DISCUSSIONS：\n\n【18】The patient was a 43 years old female with no comorbidities， Eastern cooperative oncology group 1. She presented with bleed-ing per rectum， altered bowel habit and loss of weight for the past ten months. There is no previous medical or surgical history but seasonal allergy for the 15 years.\n\n【19】She had low haemoglobin level at initial presentation for which she was transfused with two units of packed red blood cells. Her baseline carcinoembryonic level was 1.63 ng /dl. Colonoscopy was performed， which showed polypoid tumour occupying the entire lumen of the sigmoid. Scope passed with difficulty， and the rest of the colon was normal. Histopathol-ogy showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the background of tubulovillous adenoma.\n\n【20】Computed tomographic scan (CT) of abdomen and pelvis showed distal sigmoid colocolic intussusception with a circum-ferential thickening at a lead point， which could represent T2/T3， N0 tumour without any distant metastasis. CT scan of the thorax showed no metastases.\n\n【21】COn examination abdomen was soft and non-tender， no mass palpable. As per the protocol of the hospital， she was discussed in the multi-disciplinary team (MDT) meeting， and the recom-mendation was to assess her for surgery. Laparoscopic anterior resection was performed. During the intraoperative period， she remained stable. Total time for surgery was 285 minutes， with blood loss of 50 ml. During the procedure， high ligation of Inferior mesenteric vein and Inferior mesenteric artery was performed； splenic flexure was mobilized with colorectal sta-pled anastomosis. Intraoperative input was 3800mls， and urine output was 150 ml. She was kept in the post-anaesthesia care unit for 115 minutes after which she was sent to the ward. Her post-operative period was uneventful； she regained bowel func-tions on the 3rd day of surgery. She was discharged on 5th post-operative day.\n\n【22】She visited emergency room nine days after surgery with a complaint of abdominal pain for last three days which was gen-eralized dull in character， non-radiating， moderate in intensity， no associated history of fever， vomiting， constipation. She was treated with proton pump inhibitors and sent home in stable condition. She again came to the emergency room on 11th post-operative with same complains， but she had constipation for the last two days. On examination， the abdomen was tender； bowel sound was audible. She had tachycardia of 130 beats/min， and Labs showed mildly raised white blood cell count of 11.44， high C reactive protein levels， i.e. 66 mg/dl (Normal rangeless than 5 mg/dl)， serum lactate levels of 34.9 mg/dl ( normal level4.5-22.0 mg/dl)， amylase and lipase level were normal. CT scan was performed， which showed interval development of exten-sive portal vein thrombosis with periportal edema； extending into the superior mesenteric veins.No evidence of bowel wall ischemia or portal vein gas. No cavernous transformation and features of liver cirrhosis. Collection around anastomosis of6x3 cm seen but no anastomotic leak was appreciated.\n\n【23】She was admitted the same day for the management of Portal vein thrombosis as per hospital guidelines. Therapeutic dose of enoxaparin was commenced at 1 mg/kg. She had moder-ate pain which was managed with patient-controlled analgesia(morphine). Her lactate levels came back to normal on 12th\n\n【24】postoperative day and responded well to conservative manage-ment.\n\n【25】The patient was re-scanned on 19th postoperative day， which showed massive residual thrombus in the portal vein with the ring of peripheral contrast suggestive of early recanalization. Rivaroxaban 20mg was started after consultation with a haema-tologist， and the patient was discharged on 19th postoperative day with six months of anticoagulant therapy. The patient was followed up for one year with CT scan on six months and one year. On six month， CT showed complete resolution of portal vein thrombosis. She was again reassessed after a year， she had no symptoms. Her CT scan was clear of any thrombosis， and she had no recurrence.\n\n【26】Discussion\n\n【27】PVT is not a known complication of laparoscopic colorectal surgery. The typical presentation of acute PVT is with abdominal pain， nausea and fever. The severity of symptoms may correlate with the extent of mesenteric venous thrombosis because of associated bowel ischemia \\[10\\]. Around 10% of cases of bowel ischemia are due to mesenteric venous thrombosis \\[11\\].\n\n【28】There are various case reports which hint towards the de-velopment of PVT and SMV thrombosis following resection of colorectal cancer \\[12-14\\]. Millikan et al. first reported mesenteric vein thrombosis after colonic resection \\[14\\]. Clinical presentation of PVT and SMV thrombosis are out of proportion non-specific abdominal pain， nausea， vomiting and gastrointestinal bleeding. Signs associated with this clinical condition are abdominal ten-derness， distension and fever \\[12J. Raised leucocyte count is a constant feature. Our patient presented with abdominal pain and constipation. On clinical examination， she had raised pulse rate (130 beats/minutes)， generalized abdominal tenderness and raised total leucocyte count (TLC).\n\n【29】Though ultrasound can detect PVT， CT scan has the sensi-tivity of 90%. In this case， a CT scan was performed when the patient presented the second time in the emergency depart-ment. If it thrombus reaches SMV from PV， the reported rate of mortality is up to 50% \\[15\\]. Thus， early diagnosis and early management are both crucial for the restoration of portal venous flow and prevention of advancement of thrombus and to treat complications of established PVT， thereby reducing mortality.\n\n【30】Pneumoperitoneum due to carbon dioxide insufflation can result in splanchnic thrombosis. A variety of factors are respon-sible for it， including pressure mediated hemodynamic changes， hypercapnia induced mesenteric vasoconstriction or coagulation impairment \\[16\\]. Rasmussen et al. reported an inverse relation\n\n【31】between the increase in intra-abdominal pressure and reduction in portal blood pressure， thus resulting in vascular bed vasocon-striction and increase in resistance to blood flow across liver \\[17\\]. Epstein et al.， and Ishizaki et al.， also explained the pathogenesis of vasoconstriction and reduction of splanchnic blood flow \\[16，18J.\n\n【32】The management of uncomplicated PVT and SMV thrombo-sis is anticoagulation and supportive care. Early anticoagulation results in early recanalization of PV. We started heparin once the diagnosis of PVT was esta1OSblished， and it was continued during her hospital stay. Duration of anticoagulation is still de-batable， but anticoagulation of 6 months to 1 year is suggested by guidelines (19). Our patient received oral anticoagulation for six months， which resulted in complete recanalization of PV and\n\n【33】SMV.\n\n【34】Conclusion\n\n【35】The portal vein thrombosis， in this case， possibly is a 'provoked'thrombosis due to recent abdominal surgery in the setting of active malignancy. More data is required to inquire about the above risk factors and management. Early detection and interac-tion are likely to be beneficial to reduce morbidity and mortality.\n\n【36】Conflict of interest\n\n【37】There are no conflicts of interest to declare by any of the authors of this study.\n\n【38】Ethical Approval\n\n【39】Due to the retrospective nature of the study， the exemption was granted from the Institutional Review Board of Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre.\n\n【40】Authors Contributions\n\n【41】·Dr. Osama Shakeel (OS)-Study lead， Study concept and manuscript writing.\n\n【42】·Dr. Abdul Wahid Anwer (AWA) -Data collection and anal-yses where needed.\n\n【43】·Dr. Irfan Ul Islam Nasir (IUIN)-Manuscript review.\n\n【44】· Dr. Awais Amjad Malik (AAM) -Data collection and analy-ses where needed.\n\n【45】· Dr. Ihtisham Ul Haq (IUH)-Data collection and analyses where needed.\n\n【46】·Dr. Faizan Ullah (FU)-Manuscript review.\n\n【47】· Dr. Hannan Ali (HA)-Data collection and analyses where needed.\n\n【48】·Dr. Shahid Khattak -Supervision\n\n【49】·Dr. Aamir Ali Syed-Supervision\n\n【50】References\n\n【51】1\\.

This combination of compositions forms an acidic layer (normal pH of 6.8)， which helps prevent infection of the ear canal. Cerumen contains various antimicrobial factors， which also prevent infection. This study aims to compare bactericidal activity on cerumen and ofloxacin in vitro in Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Method： The study used a type of in vitro laboratory experimental research to compare bactericidal activity in cerumen and ofloxacin drops against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Result： Based on the research results for Staphylococcus aureus bacteria， the average inhibition capability of cerumen was 0.7 ± 2.1 mm. At the same time， the average inhibition capability of ofloxacin was 32.9±0.9 mm. For the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa， the average inhibition capability of cerumen is 0±0 mm. At the same time， the average inhibition capability of ofloxacin was 31.3±0.5 mm. Both variables show significant differences because both have a p-value lower than p <0.05.

The cerumen is removed from the ear by the natural mechanism of ear cleansing in the form of epithelial migration from the umbo of the tympanic membrane laterally. Movement of the jaw when chewing helps the process of removing cerumen from the external auditory canal.\\[1\\]\n\n【17】Cerumen contains various antimicrobial factors， which show a broad-spectrum activity against various pathogenic bacteria and form an inherent biochemical protection complex. Antimi-crobial peptides are considered to have an important role in defence against infection. Natural defences involving innate immunity include large amounts of antimicrobial peptides and proteins. These antimicrobial peptides and proteins include human B-Defensin (hBD)， LL-37， dermcidin， lysoferin，lactofer-rin， secretory protease leukocyte secretion (SLPI， antileukopro-teinase)， and alpha 1-antitrypsin. These proteins and peptides exhibit broad-spectrum activity against various microorganisms， including bacteria， fungi， viruses， yeast， and protozoa. The most\n\n【18】common microorganisms found in the human ear are Staphylo-\n\n【19】coccus aureus (24.6%)， and Pseudomonas (9.0%). \\[2，3\\]\n\n【20】Research on an in-vitro comparison of cerumen bactericidal\n\n【21】effect against Staphyloccocus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa\n\n【22】bacteria is still very limited， thus this study aims to determine the in vitro comparative effect of cerumen bactericidal and ofloxacin\n\n【23】ear drops against Staphyloccocus aureus and Pseudomonas aerugi-YIOSU.\n\n【24】Methods\n\n【25】This study uses in vitro experimental laboratory research to compare bactericidal activity in cerumen and ofloxacin ear drops\n\n【26】against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This\n\n【27】study was approved by the Research Ethics Commission of the Faculty of Medicine of Udayana University with No. 1950/UN14.2.2.VII.14/LP / 2019 dated June 27，2019. The samples were taken from visitors to the ENT-KL clinic at Sanglah Hospital， aged 5 to 42 years， including men and women. Cerumen was collected with sterile earwax hooks from individuals and stored in sterile bottles at 4°C.\n\n【28】The well-collected samples were weighed and suspended in a buffer solution (5%ofNaHCO3，pH8.2， containing 30% glycerol) at a concentration of 3.5% (weight/volume). The cerumen-buffer mixture is homogenized by repetition through a series of needles ranging from 19 to 23. This procedure breaks the cerumen into fine particles distributed evenly in the buffer and produces a milk-like suspension.\n\n【29】Tested bacteria are taken with a sterile needle， then implanted on the media by scraping to be tilted. Furthermore， it was incu-bated in an incubator at 37-C for 24 hours. The same treatment is carried out on each type of tested bacteria.\\[4\\] Observations were made after 24 hours of the incubation period. A clear area is a sign of bacterial sensitivity to antibiotics or other antibacterial agents used as test material expressed by the width of the inhi-bition zone diameter. Inhibition zone diameters are measured in millimetres (mm) using a scales bar using the overall diameter minus the disk diameter of 7 mm. \\[5，6\\]\n\n【30】Results Inhibitory zone against Staphylococcus aureus\n\n【31】From 18 cerumen samples， there were two samples， which gave inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus， with a diameter of 6 mm and 7 mm， respectively. Sixteen cerumen samples did not pro-vide inhibition ag ainst the Staphylococcus aureus. The inhibition zone results can be seen in Table 1.\n\n【32】Based on the study results， the average inhibition capability of cerumen was 0.7 ±2.1 mm. At the same time， the average inhibitory capability of the ofloxacin ear drop was 32.9±0.9mm. Both variables show significant differences because they have a p-value lower than 0.05. A comparison of inhibition capabilities between cerumen and ofloxacin ear drops can be seen below.\n\n【33】Inhibitory zone against Pseudomonas aeruginosa\n\n【34】From 18 cerumen samples， all cerumen samples did not provide any inhibition capability against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The inhibition zone results can be seen in Table 3.\n\n【35】Based on the study results， the average inhibition capability of cerumen was 0 ± 0 mm. At the same time， the average inhibi-tion capability of ofloxacin was 31.3 ± 0.5 mm. Both variables show significant differences because they have a p-valuelower\n\n【36】Table 1 Inhibitory Zone against Staphylococcus aureus (in mm).\n\n| Sample'sCode  | Cerumen  | Ofloxacin EarDrop  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | 0  | 32  |\n| 2  | 0  | 34  |\n| 3  | 0  | 32  |\n| 4  | 0  | 34  |\n| 5  | 0  | 33  |\n| 6  | 0  | 32  |\n| 7  | 0  | 34  |\n| 8  | 0  | 32  |\n| 9  | 6  | 34  |\n| 10  | 0  | 33  |\n| 11  | 7  | 32  |\n| 12  | 0  | 34  |\n| 13  | 0  | 32  |\n| 14  | 0  | 34  |\n| 15  | 0  | 33  |\n| 16  | 0  | 32  |\n| 17  | 0  | 34  |\n| 18  | 0  | 32  |\n\n【38】than 0.05. A comparison of the inhibition capabilities of cerumen and ofloxacin eardrops can be seen in Table 4.\n\n【39】Discussion\n\n【40】Cerumen forms an acidic coating that helps prevent infection in the ear canal. Cerumen functions as an antimicrobial by physically protecting the external auditory canal， building low pH and producing antimicrobial compounds such as lysozyme. Cerumen plays a clinical role in host defence， which appears to be relatively weak. If the cerumen plays a role in strengthening the host defence system， its composition will change in response to infection. Exposure to bacteria will trigger the regulation of the antibacterial component of cerumen. However， the patient's cerumen with otitis externa do not appear to contain more an-tibacterial unsaturated fatty acids than those that are not in a state of infection. According to Davis and Stout， the inhibition of cerumen is relatively weak， and the inhibition of ofloxacin is classified as very strong against Staphylococcus aureus. These results follow Chai's study， which states that newly collected(dry form) samples were suspended at a concentration of 3%in the glycerol-sodium bicarbonate buffer showing bactericidal activity against several bacterial strains tested. This suspension reduces the viability of Haemophilus influenzae， Escherichia coli K-12， and Serratia marcescens by more than 99%. In contrast， the viability of two isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa， E. coli K-1，\n\n【41】Streptococcus， and two Staphylococcus aureus isolates originating\n\n【42】from humans was reduced by 30 to 80%. The results support the hypothesis that cerumen kills certain foreign organisms， which enter the ear canal.\\[6，7\\]\n\n| Variable  |  | Material Tested  | p Value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Cerumen (n=18)  | Ofloxacin Ear Drop (n=18)  |  |\n| Inhibition Capability (mm) Mean ± SD  | 0.7±2.1  | 32.9±0.9  | 0.000  |\n\n【44】Table 3 Inhibitory Zone Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (in mm).\n\n| Sample'scode  | Cerumen  | Ofloxacin Ear Drop  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | 0  | 31  |\n| 2  | 0  | 31  |\n| 3  | 0  | 31  |\n| 4  | 0  | 32  |\n| 5  | 0  | 32  |\n| 6  | 0  | 31  |\n| 7  | 0  | 31  |\n| 8  | 0  | 31  |\n| 9  | 0  | 32  |\n| 10  | 0  | 32  |\n| 11  | 0  | 31  |\n| 12  | 0  | 31  |\n| 13  | 0  | 31  |\n| 14  | 0  | 32  |\n| 15  | 0  | 32  |\n| 16  | 0  | 31  |\n| 17  | 0  | 31  |\n| 18  | 0  | 31  |\n\n【46】Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive coccus shaped germ and lived as individual organisms， in pairs and groups. Staphy-lococcus is a non-motile， nonporous， catalase-positive bacterium and is part of normal human flora found in the axillary inguinal， perineal and interior nares. These microorganisms produce tox-ins that can cause specific diseases or syndromes and can cause the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus infections.\\[10\\]\n\n【47】There were reports of bactericidal activity of cerumen. The report is based on the consideration that nutrient-rich ear wax allows bacteria and fungi to grow. On the other hand，several re-ports describe the antimicrobial effects of earwax on various bac-teria， including Haemophilus influenzae， Staphylococcus aureus， Escherichia coli and fungi. Stoeckelhuber et al. reported detecting antimicrobial proteins B-defensin-1，B-defensin-2， cathelicidin， lysozyme， lactoferrin， MUC1 and the secretory component of IgA in glandular cells obtained in the histochemical analysis. Not only the glands but also the skin of the ear canal can pro-duce antimicrobial peptides such as human p-defensin 1 (hBD1) and human B-defensin 2 (hBD2). Yong et al. has isolated hBD1\n\n【48】and hBD2 in human cerumen in 2008.\\[3\\]\n\n【49】Several studies have proven that each antimicrobial peptide has an antimicrobial effect. Singh et al. showed that the combina-tion of lactoferrin and SLPI was synergistic， and the combination involving human p-defensins， LL-37 and tobramycin had an ad-ditive effect. Chen et al. analysed the individual and synergistic activity of hBD1-3， LL-37 and lysozyme in different environ-ments. They found that this AMP showed antibacterial activity\n\n【50】against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in a dependent\n\n【51】way on normal pH temperature and acidic pH temperature. The antibacterial activity of hBD1-3 was significantly enhanced in an acidic environment (pH 4.6). The synergistic effect of hBD， LL-37 and lysozyme on Staphylococcus aureus is significantly enhanced in an acidic environment. Protein has been shown to have an unsynergetic additive effect on the antibacterial activity in an acidic environment against Escherichia coli. \\[11\\]\n\n【52】Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces several endotoxins and ex-tracellular products that support local invasion and microorgan-isms spreading. These extracellular toxins and products include extracellular proteases， cytotoxins， haemolysins， and pyocyanin. For systemic diseases， products that support invasion include antiphagocytic capsules， endotoxins， exotoxins A， and exotoxins S.\\[8\\]\n\n【53】Antibiotic treatment that can effectively fight Pseudomonas neruginosa is quite difficult to find， and this is due to the antibiotic-resistant mechanism Pseudomonas aeruginosa. How to deal with this bacterial infection is with aggressive antimicro-bial therapy， such as combining two bactericidal antibiotics such as aminoglycoside， p-lactam antibiotics， anti-pseudomonal，or quinolones.10\\]\n\n【54】Pseudomonas are gram-negative， aerobic， positive catalase， positive oxidase， unable to ferment， can oxidize carbohydrates， are not sporous， have no sheath and have monotonic flagella that are always moving. \\[9\\] Factors that cause these germs to fight the body's defence system and causing manifestations are philly. In contrast， the factor that determines the pathogenic power of these germs is exotoxin A， an ADP-ribose transferase that functions to inhibit protein synthesis of eukaryotes. Symptoms of sepsis and septic shock are the results of the presence of Pseu-domonas aeruginosa endotoxins. The occurrence of chromosome mutations in bacterial genes that encode drug target enzyme subunits， DNA gyrase， and topoisomerase Ⅳ， disrupting the target enzymes to work in affinity with ofloxacin. Another thing that can cause resistance is the inhibition of the drugs diffusion process into the cytoplasm of bacteria. The activity of extracellu-lar enzymes can create a nest that is protected against the normal defence of the mucosa as well as against antibiotics. The growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in its nest is wrapped in exopolysac-charide (biofilm)， thus protecting it against the penetration of antibiotics， antibodies， complement and phagocytic cells. These properties give rise to resistance to antibiotics and difficult to eradicate the disease.\n\n| Variable  | Cerumen  | Material Tested Ofloxacin Ear Drop  | p-value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | (n=18)  | (n=18)  |  |\n| Inhibition Capability (mm) mean±SD  | 0±0  | 31.3±0.5  | 0.000  |\n\n【56】Conclusion\n\n【57】This study concludes that there was an inhibition capability of cerumen against the growth of Staphylococcus aureus bacte-ria. There was no inhibition capability of cerumen against the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria. There were differ-ences in the inhibition capabilities of cerumen and ofloxacin ear drops against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria.\n\n【58】Funding\n\n【59】This study was funded by ORL-HNS Department Udayana Uni-versity/ Sanglah Hospital Denpasar.\n\n【60】Conflict of interest\n\n【61】There are no conflicts of interest to declare by any of the authors of this study.\n\n【62】References\n\n【63】1\\.

Cardiologists face various chal-lenges in obtaining vascular access and cannulation of the coronary sinus. The left cephalic-axillary-subclavian (CAS) venous route is commonly used for LV \\[Left ventricular\\] pacing via coronary sinus. Although this approach is com-monly used it has been demonstrated that the CAS venous route is not always accessible. Herein we describe a case of implantable defibrillator (ICD) upgraded to biventricular pacing system using right internal jugular venous route for left ventricular pacing lead implantation.\n\n【24】CASE REPORT\n\n【25】We report a case of a 61 year old Afro-American female with a known history of NYHA \\[New York Heart Association\\] class 4 heart failure secondary to idiopathic cardiomyop-athy who continued to be symptomatic despite being on maximal medical treatment. This patient was admitted on multiple occasions due to decompensated heart failure and was noted to have wide QRS complex making her a suitable candidate for cardiac resynchronization therapy.\n\n【26】She previously had an implantable cardioverter-defibrilla-tor \\[ICD\\] via left cephalic subclavian (CAS) route. During that procedure， an attempt to implant a left ventricular(LV) pacing lead was unsuccessful due to unexpected dif-ficulty associated with accessing the coronary sinus. The pa-tient was subsequently referred to our cardiac electrophysi-ology service. In light of the fact that the patient has failed LV lead placement via left CAS route previously， the oper-ator opted to cannulate the coronary sinus via the right in-ternal jugular route. In the event that the cannulation suc-ceeded， the LV lead will be placed via the left CAS route.\n\n【27】Procedure\n\n【28】Intravenous dobutamine was administered during the pro-cedure in order to optimize cardiac hemodynamics. The pa-tient was intubated and an arterial line inserted for contin-uous blood pressure monitoring. The right jugular vein was entered and the coronary sinus was successfully cannulated using the Rapido system guide catheter. Left upper extrem-ity venogram (Figure 1) as well as Coronary sinus venog-raphy was performed and the posterolateral branch of the vessel was found to originate from a separate ostium at the posterior septal aspect of the tricuspid annulus (Figure 2). The existing ICD pocket was opened. The generator was subsequently disconnected and adequate pacing and sens-ing parameters were documented.\n\n【29】Venous access was later obtained via the left axillary vein and Rapido advance system was introduced into the vein in an effort to cannulate the coronary sinus which was not attainable despite the use of different guide catheters se ondary to severe right atrial (RA) dilatation. Another at-tempt through right axillary vein was not successful in can-nulating the coronary sinus. Considering the fact that the coronary sinus cannulation was done via the right internal\n\n【30】Figure 1. Left upper extremity venogram showing partial obstruction of left subclavian vein with post stenotic dilatation of subclavian vein.\n\n【31】Figure 2. Coronary sinus venogram showing coronary sinus ostium.\n\n【32】jugular approach， the right internal jugular vein was re-can-nulated and the posterolateral vengus branch was identi-fied (Figures 3， 4). EASYTRAK 2 V (Guidant Co) pacing lead was subsequently advanced through the posterolateral branch to the lateral aspect of the left ventricular free wall. The LV lead was anchored to the lateral aspect of the neck and was tunneled to the right subclavian area and over the anterior chest wall to the left subclavian and connected to the new biventricular-ICD generator (Figure 4). The post-operative course was uneventful.\n\n【33】DISCUSSION\n\n【34】Heart failure patients with previous right ventricular device have a higher chance of subclavian vein acclusion \\[3，4\\].In that scenario internal jugular vein is a suitable alternative for coronary sinus cannulation and left ventricular lead placement \\[5，6\\]. Pires et al. \\[7\\] successfully placed biven-tricular devices in ten patients using right internal jugular vein without any complications. As discussed by Pires et al.\\[7\\] the possible complications for internal jugular vein ap-proach are higher potential for lead fracture and also skin\n\n【35】Figure 3. Coronary sinus venogram showing Ostium of Posterolateral branch of Coronary sinus.\n\n【36】Figure 4. Chest x-ray showing placement ofleads.\n\n【37】erosion as the lead is tunneled subcutaneously when com-pared to traditional CAS approach. Despite these potential disadvantages NYHA (New York Heart Association) class IV symptoms and the need for catecholamines justified this pro-\n\n【38】cedure in our patient when compared to the higher risks from open chest surgery in epicardial approach.\n\n【39】Our case illustrates that the right internal jugular can be successfully utilized as an alternative route for coronary si-nus cannulation. This patient did not have any procedure related complications. Right internal jugular vein approach is particularly valid in instances where it is difficult to ac-cess the coronary sinus via the traditional left cephalic axil-lary subclavian route due to variation in the anatomy \\[7，8\\].\n\n【40】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【41】Technically impossible right sided coronary sinus cannula-tion can be overcome using right internaljugular approach and it is a reasonable alternative before opting for more in-vasive epicardial approach.\n\n【42】REFERENCES：\n\n【43】1\\.

It is usually flesh-colored or hyperpigmented， and it may appear as surface nodules or papillomas on vulva \\[1\\].\n\n【25】The size of the lesion is generally 1-2 cm， but rarely it can reach extremely large size， up to 15-20 cm. Clinically， it behaves in a benign fashion， although there is a tendency for local recurrence after incom-plete excision. High levels of estrogen and progester-one during pregnancy， hormone replacement therapy in the postmenopausal woman may play a role in the development of acrochordons \\[2\\].\n\n【26】Histologically， acrochordons may be of two types，one that is predominantly epithelial and another that is primarily stromal. The epithelial surface varies from a thickened layer with papilomatosis， hyperkeratosis， to an attenuated flattened layer exhibiting multiple primary folds \\[3\\].\n\n【27】We present an unusual case of a slowly growing large size achrochordon in an adolescent girl.\n\n【28】CASE REPORT\n\n【29】A 20-year-old girl was admitted to our clinic with a 6-year history of a slowly growing papillomatous and irregular shaped vulvar lesion on the right labium majus (Figure 1). The maximum diameter of the mass was 11 cm and the surface has irregular skin folds. The mass was excised by wide local excision under mask anesthesia. The mass size was about 11x7.5x2cm. The vulvar skin was closed with 2-0 non-absorb-able sutures. Histopathologically， the tumor was diag-\n\n【30】Figure 1. There is hyperplastic epidermis and papillomatosis. The connective tissue stalk contains loosely arranged collagen fibers and many capillaries (HEx40).\n\n【31】nosed as an acrochordon (fibroepithelial polyp)，and the surface of the primary polypoid lesion exhibited papillomatosis and hyperkeratosis which covered by intact epidermis. Additionally the dermal connective tissue was composed of loose bundles of collogen with several small sized vessels and the stroma was hypocellular and edematous.\n\n【32】The follow-up visit of patient at 6 month postopera tively showed normal findings and no recurrence.\n\n【33】DISCUSSION\n\n【34】Vulvar achrochordon is a relatively uncommon be-nign polypoid tumor of the vulva commonly known as skin tag o orr Coccasionally fibroepithelial polyps \\[1\\]. Achrochordon usually occur in young to middle aged women in their reproductive years， presenting more commonly in the vagina， but also occurring in the vulva and rarely the cervix. Achrocordons are sessile or pedunculated macroscopically and after incomplete excision they have the potential for local， non-destructive recurrence. They characteristically contain a fibrovas-cular core. The stromal cellularity of the polyp can be quite variable. The hypocellular variant is composed of spindle cells set within a finely collagenous myxoid-like stroma. In the hypercellular form， the cells exhibit pleomorphism with mitotic figures. The pathogenesis of achrochordon is not well understood. However some evidences suggest that hormonal influences may play a role in their formation \\[2-4\\]. In our case， twenty-year-old girl had a history 6-year history of a slowly grow-ing vulvar achrochordon arising from the right labium majus. We measured the size of the tumor 11 cm in its largest diameter on the contrary of reported datas.\n\n【35】The overlapping clinical and morphological appear-ance of achrocordons localized to the vulvovaginal region cause differential diagnostic problems. The lesions characteristic of this site are angiomyxoma， angiomyofibroblastoma， embryonal rhabdomyosar-coma and cellular angiofibroma \\[1-4\\]. Angiomyxoma is a slowly growing soft tissue tumor with significant potential for recurrence in genital region. Histologic characteristic feature is the presence of perivascular and perineural well-developed myoid cells \\[5\\]. We consider our case clinically may be a myxoma but histologically， the presence of perivascular and peri-neural well-developed myoid cells could not be deter-mined. Angiomyofibroblastoma typically presents as a superficial mass and clinically is often a simulator of Bartholin’s gland cyst or lipoma. Histologically， the plump round-to-spindle shaped myofibroblasts are clustered in the background of variably edematous and collagenous stroma \\[6\\]. Cellular angiofibroma is a recently described benign stromal tumour of the\n\n【36】vulva. It is characterized by its generally small size and usually well-circumscribed margin. Histologically， cellular angiofibroma is usually well-circumscribed， being composed of bland spindle shaped cells ar-ranged in short intersecting fascicles \\[7\\].Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma usually occurs in children less than 10 years of age. It is characterized by the presence of subepithelial hypercellular zone and rhabdomyo-blasts that exhibit immunohistochemical positivity with specific skeletal muscle markers \\[1-3\\].\n\n【37】REFERENCES：\n\n【38】1\\.

It is a rare but possi-bly under-diagnosed metastatic disease in women. At present， a postmenopausal woman without a clear pri-mary tumor should have a pregnancy test performed to rule out choriocarcinoma， as it is readily responsive to therapy.\n\n【26】MeSH Keywords： Choriocarcinoma · Neoplasm Metastasis · Postmenopause\n\n【27】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/917656\n\n【28】口\n\n【29】H品1273 1 山节凯\n\n【30】4\n\n【31】Choriocarcinomas are tumors that result from abnormal pro-liferation of trophoblastic and syncytiotrophoblastic cells and are associated with secretion of beta-human chorionic gonado-tropin (B-hCG) \\[1\\]. Choriocarcinoma is most commonly seen in women of childbearing age within 1 year following a pregnancy； approximately 50% of choriocarcinomas have an antecedent molar pregnancy \\[2\\]. They are rapidly invasive and widely meta-static， most often to the lung， vagina， brain， liver， and kidney \\[2\\].\n\n【32】The incidence of choriocarcinoma varies by location， but has been estimated to occur in between 1 in 20 000 to 1 in 25 000women between the ages of 15 and 49. The incidence in post-menopausal women is extremely low and an estimate is not available \\[3\\].\n\n【33】Here， we describe a rare case of postmenopausal metastatic choriocarcinoma to the brain in a 66-year-old woman present-ing with neurologic symptoms 41 years after her last preg-nancy and 17 years after menopause.\n\n【34】Case Report\n\n【35】A 66-year-old white woman， gravida 3 para 2， with history of1 elective abortion， presented with symptoms of left upper-and lower-extremity weakness and focal seizure. Her medical history was significant for insulin-dependent diabetes melli-tus， dyslipidemia， hypertension， hypothyroidism，bipolar disor-der， and morbid obesity. Her obstetric history was significant for 2 uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal deliveries， a first-tri-mester elective abortion， and menopause at 49 years of age.\n\n【36】The patient was seen in the Emergency Department， where computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) of the brain revealed a 2-cm right parietal lobe hemor-rhagic brain mass (Figure 1A， 1B). She was admitted to the Neurosurgery Service， where she underwent craniotomy with excision of the mass. The pathology report stated that the tu-mor was composed of malignant syncytiotrophoblastic and cytotrophoblastic cells， consistent with choriocarcinoma， and staining for immunohistochemical expression of p-hCG was positive (Figure 2A，2B).\n\n【37】During further interview， the patient admitted to a few spo-radic episodes of postmenopausal vaginal bleeding over the past month. She denied seeking any medical attention for these symptoms. A pelvic exam revealed scant vaginal blood with no cervical or vaginal masses or lesions seen. The uterus was palpated to be approximately 20-week size.\n\n【38】Laboratory results showed an elevated quantitative B-hCG lev-el of 9023 mlU/mL. Of note， the B-hCG was drawn 7 days af-ter removal of the brain mass. Cancer antigen 125 (CA-125)， alpha fetoprotein (AFP)， and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were normal.\n\n【39】CT imaging of the chest， abdomen， and pelvis was signifi-cant for right upper-lobe lung nodules， the largest measuring2 cm， and an enlarged， irregularly-shaped uterus containing an intrauterine device (Figure 3). A pelvic sonogram demon-strated an enlarged， irregularly contoured uterus measuring12.8×19.7 cm， with an intrauterine device seen in the endo-metrial cavity. No adnexal masses were identified. The study was limited secondary to the patient's obesity.\n\n【40】Figure 1. (A) Head computed tomography at initial diagnosis showing a hemorrhagic lesion of the right parietal lobe. (B) Brain magnetic resonance imaging showing a tumor of the right parietal lobe of the brain.\n\n【41】Figure 2. (A) The brain tumor was composed of large multi-nucleated syncytiotrophoblastic cells and medium-sized cytotrophoblastic cells lying in a hemorrhagic and necrotic stroma (hematoxylin and eosin staining). (B) Staining for the intracerebral metastatic choriocarcinoma shows strong immunohistochemical expression of B-hCG (dark brown).\n\n【42】Figure 3. Pelvis computed tomography showing an enlarged， irregularly-shaped uterus with intrauterine device.\n\n【43】An endometrial biopsy was performed. Histologic examination was conclusive for endocervix accompanied by fragments of choriocarcinoma (Figure 4).\n\n【44】According to the World Health Organization (WHO) prognostic score for gestational trophoblastic disease， our patient had a score of 13， making her high risk for resistance to monothera-py and characterized her as FIGO stage lV gestational tropho-blastic neoplasia (Table 1).\n\n【45】The patient was scheduled for an appointment with Gynecologic Oncology and Medical Oncology for discussion of treatment options， including chemotherapy. Given her metastatic dis-ease， she was offered combination chemotherapy with the EMACO regimen (etoposide， methotrexate， and dactinomy-cin， followed by cyclophosphamide and vincristine)， which is considered first-line therapy \\[4\\]. Previous case reports of post-menopausal choriocarcinoma have reported good response and\n\n【46】Figure 4. Histology of the endometrial biopsy revealed malignant cells with some multi-nucleation and hyper-chromatic nuclei， consistent with choriocarcinoma (hematoxylin and eosin staining).\n\n【47】cure with this regimen \\[5\\]. Our patient is currently in a skilled nursing facility where she will receive interdisciplinary care to allow for improved quality of life and was scheduled to begin EMACO therapy. Due to multiple co-morbidities and immobili-ty， our patient has not been able to follow-up with our facility； therefore， we were unable to determine the treatment effect.\n\n【48】Discussion\n\n【49】The presentation of this case report is very unusual； there-fore， it is very difficult to identify steps to prevent similar cas-es in the future. If diagnosed and managed in a timely fash-ion， choriocarcinoma is considered to be the most curable gynecologic cancer， even in the setting of metastasis. Non-gestational trophoblastic neoplasia in the postmenopausal period is extremely rare \\[6\\]. In our review of the literature， we found very few studies of gestational trophoblastic disease in postmenopausal women. There are a few reports of long la-tent periods between the last pregnancy and the occurrence of choriocarcinoma， but the mechanism for this remains un-certain \\[7-9\\]. Clinical signs and symptoms of postmenopausal\n\n| Risk factor  | 0  | 1  | 2  | 4  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age  | <40 years old  | \\>40 years old  | 一  |  |\n| Antecedent Pregnancy  | Mole  | Abortion  | lerm  |  |\n| Interval months from pregnancy  | <4  | 4-6  | 7-12  | \\>12  |\n| Pretreatment serum hCG level  | <10  | 10-104  | 104-105  | \\>10  |\n| Largest tumor size (including uterus)  | <3cm  | 3-4cm  | \\>5cm  |  |\n| Size of metastases  | Lung  | Spleen， kidney  | Gastrointestinal system  | Liver， brain  |\n| Number of metastases  |  | 1-4  | 5-8  | \\>8  |\n| Previous failed chemotherapy  | 一  |  | Single drug  | 2 or more drugs  |\n\n【51】choriocarcinoma are not specific. In previous case reports， the most common presenting symptom has been postmenopaus-al vaginal bleeding， for which these patients underwent thor-ough workup for endometrial cancers， including transvaginal ultrasounds and endometrial biopsies \\[5，10\\].\n\n【52】Choriocarcinoma can be diagnosed by histologic examination of the tumor showing malignant cytotrophoblasts， intermedi-ate trophoblasts， and syncytiotrophoblasts \\[11\\]. The tissue is typically arranged in a biphasic pattern， with absence of cho-rionic villi (although the presence of villi does not exclude the diagnosis) \\[1\\]. Elevated serum p-hCG and human placental lac-togen (h-PL) are found in choriocarcinoma \\[1\\].\n\n【53】Our patient presented with neurologic symptoms secondary to brain metastases with pathologic diagnosis of choriocarci-noma. Elevated serum B-hCG confirmed the diagnosis. Given her recent postmenopausal bleeding， a mass in the uterus， and endometrial sampling being positive for choriocarcinoma， this was thought to be a primary uterine tumor with metastasis to the brain. The cause of the long latency period between last pregnancy and tumor growth with subsequent development of symptoms is not well understood.\n\n【54】Very rarely， choriocarcinoma can develop from germ cells or from dedifferentiation of endometrial carcinoma into choriocar-cinoma \\[12\\]. A postmenopausal woman presenting with vaginal bleeding from a mass and with p-hCG elevation should be im-munohistochemically analyzed to rule out the possibilities of a germ cell origin of the tumor or dedifferentiation of an epithe-lial tumor. To definitively differentiate a gestational choriocar-cinoma from a non-gestational type， a DNA analysis of the tu-mor confirming paternal DNA would need to be performed \\[12\\]. Unfortunately， we were unable to perform this testing.\n\n【55】Despite its invasive properties， metastatic choriocarcinoma is a very chemo-sensitive disease with first-line therapy of\n\n【56】combination chemotherapy using the EMA/CO regimen (etopo-side， methotrexate， and dactinomycin， followed by cyclophos-phamide and vincristine). Serial B-hCG levels should be used to measure appropriate response to chemotherapy. In many cases， chemotherapy can be curative without need for surgical excision.\n\n【57】Conclusions\n\n【58】The present case is an unusual and exceedingly rare occur-rence of postmenopausal choriocarcinoma. Our patient pre-sented with neurologic symptoms secondary to a brain mass. Pathology diagnosed choriocarcinoma； therefore， further test-ing was done， confirming a primary uterine cancer.\n\n【59】Although few cases of choriocarcinoma in a postmenopausal woman have been described， we have been unable to locate another case in the literature in which the patient presented with neurologic symptoms or a brain mass.\n\n【60】The etiology of postmenopausal choriocarcinoma is poorly un-derstood. It is possible that our patient has had disease since her elective abortion more than 50 years ago. However， this is unlikely given that the patient has been asymptomatic and was able to carry 2 normal pregnancies to term after her abortion.\n\n【61】In conclusion， choriocarcinoma should be included in the dif-ferential diagnosis for all women with evidence of metastasis， regardless of the site and patient age. Additionally， all women， again regardless of age， should have a urine pregnancy test as part of a metastatic workup， given that our patient's diagnosis was delayed until we received the pathology report regarding the brain mass. A brain mass with a positive urine pregnancy test result would have immediately instigated further investigation into a diagnosis of metastatic choriocarcinoma， and initiation of aggressive chemotherapy may have preceded and possibly even prevented the need for craniotomy and tumor resection.\n\n【62】References：\n\n【63】1\\.

Hiccups， a benign and self-limited condition， can become persistent or intractable with overlooked underlying etiology. There are various causes of protracted hiccups， including metabolic ab-normalities， psychogenic disorders， malignancy， central nervous system pathology， medications， pulmonary dis-orders， or gastrointestinal etiologies. It is rarely attributed to cardiac disease.\n\n【19】Case Report：\n\n【20】We report a case of intractable hiccups in a 51-year-old male with cocaine related myocardial infarction (MI} before and after stent placement. Coronary angiogram showed in-stent thrombosis of the initial intervention. Following thrombectomy， balloon angioplasty， and stent， the patient recovered well without additional episodes of hiccups. Although hiccups are not known to present with a predilection for a particular cause of myocardi-al ischemia， this case may additionally be explained by the sympathomimetic effects of cocaine， which lead to vasoconstriction of coronary arteries.\n\n【21】Conclusions：\n\n【22】Hiccups associated with cardiac enzyme elevation and EKG ST-segment elevation before and after percutane-ous coronary intervention (PCI) maybe a manifestation of acute Ml with or without stent. The fact that this pa-tient was a cocaine user may have contributed to the unique presentation.\n\n【23】MeSH Keywords： Cocaine · Coronary Thrombosis · Hiccup · Myocardial Infarction· Percutaneous Coronary Intervention\n\n【24】Full-text PDF http：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/903345\n\n【25】Hiccups are an infrequently cited symptom of acute myocar-dial infarction (MI) \\[1，2\\]. This unusual presentation appears to be of importance in individuals prone to atypical presen tation such as those with diabetes， as well as in females and the elderly \\[3\\]. Previous studies have suggested that irritation of the vagus nerve is responsible for this phenomenon \\[2，4\\]. Although the occurrence of in-stent thrombosis is rare， risks for platelet activation and thrombus formation can complicate the care of patients after percutaneous coronary intervention(PCI) \\[5-9\\]. Cocaine poses a significant risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) by enhancing platelet aggregation， forming thrombi， and vasoconstriction. Here we report a case of hiccups in a patient with cocaine associated MI before and after PCI.\n\n【26】Case Report\n\n【27】A 51-year-old African American male presented with sudden onset severe non-radiating left sided chest pain， accompanied by nausea，diaphoresis， and two episodes of non-bilious vomit-ing that partially relieved his pain. His past medical history in-cluded hypertension， diabetes mellitus， asthma， and gastritis. The patient additionally admitted to regular use of marijuana，\n\n【28】but denied use of cigarettes or other illicit drugs. However， his urine drug screen was positive for cocaine， cannabinoids， and benzodiazepines. The patient was hemodynamically stable and physical examination was unremarkable.A 12-lead electrocar-diogram (ECG) revealed ST-segment elevations in the inferior leads (Figure 1). The patient received emergent cardiac catheter-ization which revealed 99% stenosis of the mid right coronary artery (RCA) with thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) grade II flow through the vessel， and 80% stenosis of the left anterior descending artery with TIMI Ill grade flow (Figure 2). A successful balloon angioplasty with stent was performed on the lesion in the mid RCA. Following intervention， there was no residual stenosis on angiography with TlMiII flow.\n\n【29】Troponin I peaked at 95.8 ng/mL. The following morning， af-ter PCI， the patient’s troponin I dropped to 16.9 ng/mL and his ECG showed resolved ST elevations. Overnight between hos-pital day 2 and 3， the patient experienced intractable hiccups and fever without chest pain but with new ST-segment ele-vation in the inferior leads. Troponin peaked at 80.3 ng/mL(Figure 3). A repeat coronary angiography revealed 100% ste-nosis of the proximal margin of the stented segment of RCA. A successful balloon angioplasty with thrombectomy and new stent placement were performed. A 50% stenosis was noted in the mid RCA， and an additional balloon angioplasty with\n\n【30】Figure 1. EKG (A) On admission： sinus rhythm with short PR with marked sinus arrhythmia with blocked PACs. Incomplete right bundle branch block. ST elevation in infero-lateral leads. (B) After first PCI： left anterior fascicular block， T wave abnormality. (C) ECG on the second day (patient developed hiccup)： left axis deviation with acute inferior infarct. (D) After second PCI： sinus tachycardia， left axis deviation.\n\n【31】Figure 2. (A) First coronary angiography： severe stenosis of mid RCA (arrow).

(D) Post intervention angiogram showing successful PCI of the RCA with a new drug-eluting stent (arrow).\n\n【32】stent was placed to restore flow TIMI III through the vessels. There was a concern for clopidogrel resistance， so clopido-grel was switched to prasugrel. Later laboratory tests for the GYP2C19 genotype revealed the patient was negative for clop-idogrel resistance.\n\n【33】Echocardiography revealed features consistent with a pseudo-normal left ventricular filling pattern， with concomitant abnor-mal relaxation and increased filling pressure (grade 2 diastolic dysfunction). The patient presented no further complications and was discharged home after five days of hospitalization.\n\n【34】Persistent hiccups as the sole presenting symptom of myocar-dial infarction (MI) has previously been rarely reported \\[1，2\\]. Unusual presentations are especially important in individuals predisposed to atypical presentation of MI \\[3\\]. The pathophys-iology of hiccups is mainly neurogenic (with neuro center lo-cated in the medulla) and possibly related to the irritation of the vagus or phrenic nerves \\[4\\]. It is believed that vagal nerve irritation is responsible for the presentation of hiccups in MI，\n\n【35】as it provides parasympathetic innervation to the heart and carries afferent nerve fibers of the hiccup reflex \\[2，4\\]. In this patient， non-retractable hiccups associated with new onset ST-segment elevation in the same ECG leads as his initial pre-sentation of ACS and significant elevated troponin prompted a repeat coronary angiography which confirmed involvement of the same artery due to in-stent thrombosis.\n\n【36】Studies have shown that hiccups occurred more frequently in patient with inferior MI and right ventricle infarction. This may be explained by the phrenic nerve forming anastomoses with the major part of the fibers reaching the pericardium from the right side \\[10\\]. In one case report， both the RCA and left anterior descending artery (LAD) had been significantly ob-structed， but the symptom of hiccups was observed to dissi-pate after the opening of RCA even though LAD remained ob-structed \\[2\\]. Our patient’s Ml and restenosis occurred in the mid right coronary artery， which further confirmed the pref-erence for right sided coronary vasculature when hiccup is a presenting symptom.\n\n【37】In-stent thrombosis is a rare event that occurs in 0.5% to 1%of patients within one-year of PCI \\[5\\]. The rates of thrombosis are comparable between drug eluding stents and bare met-al stents \\[11\\]. Risk factors for stent thrombosis include， but are not limited to， absence of platelet P2Y12 receptor blocker therapy， presence of GYP2C19 genotype associated with low-er efficacy for clopidogrel， premature discontinuation of dual anti-platelet therapy， involvement of the proximal left anteri-or descending coronary artery， multi-vessel disease， diabetes mellitus， end stage renal disease， malignancy， left ventricular dysfunction， and cocaine use \\[6，12，13\\]. In our case， the patient had three important risk factors， including diabetes mellitus， cocaine use， and multi-vessel disease， placing him at a high-er risk for stent thrombosis.\n\n【38】Although screening for urine toxicology is not a routine proto-col for ACS， it was done for this patient due to his history of regular use of marijuana and the high prevalence of drug use in the local population. The positive result suggested cocaine use within the last 80 hours， which can vary depending on the method used to intake cocaine， the dosage， as well as the use of ethanol which prolongs the clearance \\[14\\].\n\n【39】The effects of cocaine on vasoconstriction and enhanced plate-let aggregation and thrombus formation have been report-ed \\[7，15\\]. Cocaine is responsible for thrombus formation by causing platelet activation， o granule release， potentiation of thromboxane， and platelet containing micro-aggregate forma-tion \\[8，9\\]. Furthermore， cocaine has sympathomimetic activity， which can lead to ischemic events by increasing myocardial demand for oxygen and promoting coronary vasospasm \\[16\\]. Retrospective studies have shown that the rate of in-stent thrombosis post-PCl in cocaine users ranges from 5% to 33%， conferring a 10- to 60-fold increase over the general popula-tion \\[7，15\\]. Previous studies on the temporal relationship be-tween active cocaine abuse and in-stent thrombosis revealed a large time range from 11 days to 91 days post-PCl. One study showed a mean period of 51 days +40 days (median of 45 days) \\[15\\] and another study showed a mean period of28.5 days ±14 days \\[7\\]. Additional data regarding the onset timeframe between the cocaine use and the initial ACS var-ied from one minute to four days after cocaine use with about two-thirds of infarctions occurring within three hours and one-fourth occurring within one hour \\[3，4\\]. Our patient developed in-stent thrombosis within one day post-PCI.\n\n【40】Patients with in-stent thrombosis present with similar symp-toms to ACS. Without diagnostic and therapeutic PCI， it is not possible to differentiate between the two \\[17\\].In-stent throm-bosis is classified as early (less than 30 days)， late (between 31days and one year)， and very late (beyond one year) based on the stent placement. Most incidences of in-stent thrombosis\n\n【41】occur in the early stages， and become less likely as time pro-ceeds owing to the effective epithelialization of the stent \\[18\\]. In-stent thrombosis should always be part of the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with ACS after PCl， especial-ly within the last year. Management of in-stent thrombosis is similar to that of ACS， but with an even more urgent need for PCI for two reasons： first， time to re-perfusion becomes more critical in these patients as they have poorer outcomes with longer waiting time versus those with de novo coronary throm-bosis. Second， there is a higher likelihood of reperfusion fail-ure \\[19\\]. Another important factor in management is dual an-ti-platelet therapy and use of alternative agents in patients with clopidogrel resistance \\[5\\].\n\n【42】Clopidogrel resistance is especially important as it predicts high mortality and significantly increases chances of in-stent throm-bosis， underlining the benefit of testing patients for GYP2C19genotype at the cardiac catheterization lab \\[20\\]. However， platelet reactivity despite treatment is dependent on the cut-off value used for the GYP2C19 assay. A higher cut-off value will capture fewer positive results. Additionally， the variabil-ity in response to clopidogrel is multifactorial. Under dosing， drug-drug interactions， and upregulation of other platelet ac-tivating pathways may also be responsible for failure oftreat-ment response \\[21\\]. The patient in our case experienced early\n\n【43】References：\n\n【44】1\\. DavenportJ，Duong M， Lanoix R： Hiccups as the only symptom of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.

It is an invasive and rapidly growing tumor， spreading through CSF to other parts of brain and spine. Studies have shown that Medulloblastomas are characteristically hypermetabolic on 18F-FDG PET/CT.Extra-neural metastases are rare and commonly involve bone， bone marrow， lymph nodes and other viscera. Metastases to breast are even rare. Few cases of PET Scans have been reported in literature showing extra-neural metastasis. We present a treated case of Medulloblastoma in 26 years old female developing bilateral breast metastases， visualized on PET scan.\n\n【3】KEYWORDS Medulloblastoma， Bilateral Breast Metastasis，18F-FDG PET/CT\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Medulloblastoma (MB) is common pediatric brain malignancy of embryonal type involving cerebellum. Adult MB is rare with incidence rate of about 0.5 per million in USA and represents less than 1% of adult intra-cranial tumors globally \\[1\\]. It is known as rapidly growing tumor， metastasizing through cerebrospinal fluid to frequently involve other parts of brain and spine. Extra-neural metastases are rare and found in 8-13% of cases. 18F-Fluoro Deoxy Glucose Positron Emission Tomography-Com-puted Tomography (PET scan) is not routinely performed in patients of pediatric or adult MB for staging and detection of re-currence. However considering high avidity of the tumour cells of MB for 18F-FDG， PET scan is logically expected to demon-strate primary as well as metastatic disease sites accurately. We are reporting a case of adult MB in whom the metastatic disease was identified at a very rare site， demonstrating high avidity and thus emphasizing the importance of performing PET scan in cases of MB.\n\n【6】A 26 Years Female patient underwent complete gross excision\n\n【7】Copyright @ 2022 by the Bulgarian Association of Young Surgeons\n\n【8】DOI： 10.5455/IJMRCR.BilateralBreastMetastasesofCerebellarMedulloblastoma\n\n【9】First Received： March 31， 2021\n\n【10】Accepted： May 31， 2021\n\n【11】Associate Editor： Ivan Inkov (BG)；\n\n【12】Corresponding author： Muhammad Numair Younis， Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Oncology， INMOL New Campus Road， Lahore.

Patient received radiotherapy to whole spine and brain following surgery in 2016. Bone mar-row metastases were detected in 2018 for which chemotherapy was administered to achieve disease free status. In November2019 patient developed breast lumps and headache. PET scan was performed in January 2020. MIP image (Fig. 1) showed FDG avid disease in bilateral breasts and chest region. There are post operative changes in right cerebellar region with no metabolic evidence of local recurrence on PET images (Fig. 2&3). Solid density hypermetabolic masses were confirmed in bilateral breasts with SUVmax of 5.4 in right side and 6.3 in left side. Additionally hypermetabolic posterior mediastinal mass was also detected (Fig.4&5). Trucut biopsies of bilateral breasts lumps were performed. Microscopic examination on hematoxylin-eosin， original magnification X100 showed Tumour composed of small hyperchromatic cells with eosinophilic fib-rillary material in between neuropil and breast tissue (Fig.6). Tumour cells were diffusely positive for synaptophysin on im-munohistochemistry (Fig.7) and Tumour cells trapping native ducts highlighted by immunohistochemistry for Cytokeratin(Fig.8).\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】MB is known to show an aggressive behaviour both in adult and pediatric population， marked with frequent relapses and distant metastases. Most frequently involved sites outside ner-\n\n【16】vous system are bones， bone marrow， lymph nodes，lungs，liver and other viscera \\[2，3\\]. Frequency being less than 1%， metastasis to the breast has been reported in adults \\[3-8\\]. Mechanism of breast metastasis in MB is not exactly known howeverlymphatic as well as hematogenous spread has been suggested \\[5\\]. PET scan has been found useful for evaluation of primary disease in MB as it was found to show characteristic hypermetabolism\\[9J. Researchers have shown that PET is a useful tool for detec-tion of metastatic disease in spinal cord，lepto-meningeal diffuse deposits and bone marrow metastases of MB \\[10-12\\]. Gururan-gan et al has shown a significant negative correlation between increased FDG uptake on PET and patient survival \\[13\\]. To our knowledge there has been no published data showing breast metastasis on PET scan in patients of MB. Our case is also unique in showing bilateral breast metastases of MB on any imaging modality including ultrasonography. The appearance of extra-neural metastases of MB in breast is indicator of poor prognosis\\[6，8\\].\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】In conclusion， metastatic MB to bilateral breasts is very rare but possible occurrence. PET scan may be considered in evaluation of MB patients as our report and literature survey has found it useful in detecting recurrences within nervous system and extra-neural metastatic sites. Metastatic sites may be detected with high accuracy as shown in this case by the concordance of histological results and PET scan findings.\n\n【19】Funding\n\n【20】This work did not receive any grant from funding agencies in the public， commercial， or not-for-profit sectors.\n\n【21】Figure 3：\n\n【22】Figure 4：\n\n【23】Figure 5：\n\n【24】Figure 6：\n\n【25】Figure 7：\n\n【26】Figure 8：\n\n【27】Conflict of interest\n\n【28】There are no conflicts of interest to declare by any of the authors of this study.\n\n【29】References\n\n【30】1\\.

Other therapeutic options may be needed for patients in whom these conditions are resistant to aggressive management.\n\n【14】Case Report： We present a case of fulminant myocarditis that rapidly progressed to cardiogenic shock and in-hospital car-diac arrest in a 46-year-old male.

However， creatinine kinase (CK)， C-reactive protein (CRP)， and QRS width increased significantly between days 1 and 3 of treatment； the patient's hemodynamic profile deteriorated despite this treatment regimen. Intravenous methylprednisolone was initiated on day 3 at a dose of 1，000 mg/day and maintained for an additional three days. Less than 24 h after methylprednisolone admin-istration， the QRS width decreased significantly from 0.44 s to 0.18 s.

Other common findings include repetitive ventricular tachycardia and/or fibrillation \\[2，3\\]. For most cases， the combined approach of mechanical circulatory support and optimal medical treatments is sufficient for life-saving recovery of the injured myocardium. However， for 32-36% patients， the condition becomes fatal during the acute stages despite aggressive treatment \\[4，5\\]. Thus， other thera-peutic options may be necessary for patients whose conditions are resistant to aggressive management practices.\n\n【20】Case Report\n\n【21】A 46-year-old male presented to our hospital with a three-day history of moderate fever and general malaise. His medi-cal history included admission to another hospital at 38 years of age for complete atrioventricular block， where pacemak-er implantation (VDD mode) was performed. There were no evidence of myocardial necrosis and inflammation that were suggestive of myocarditis. He was admitted to our hospi-tal at 45 years of age for a non-ST-segment elevation myo-cardial infarction and treated by placement of a drug-elut-ing stent in the totally occluded middle portion of the high lateral branch. In response， the pre-discharge left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) visualized in the left ventriculogram de-creased slightly to 54%.\n\n【22】Upon patient arrival， physical examination revealed low blood pressure (90/53 mmHg) and a third heart sound detected on the apex. The first chest radiograph revealed cardiomegaly with a cardiothoracic ratio of 54% in association with moderate pul-monary congestion. The patient was initially diagnosed with\n\n【23】heart failure and admitted to a basic care unit. However， he became increasingly dyspneic， progressed to a state of shock within 1.5 h of admission， and was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU). The electrocardiogram obtained in the CICU revealed an accelerated idioventricular rhythm with ST-segment elevation in ll， Ill， and aVF leads and more prom-inent in V2-V6 leads (Figure 1A). Failure of both ventricular sensing and pacing was also noted. Elevated levels of cardiac troponin T (7.790 mg/mL) and creatinine kinase (979 IU/L) indi-cated myocardial necrosis. In addition， N-terminal B-type natri-uretic peptide levels were elevated significantly (8，273 pg/mL). Rapid development of pulmonary edema was noted in the second chest radiograph. The patient underwent intratrache-al intubation that was controlled by intermittent mandato-ry ventilation. His systolic blood pressure was approximately80 mmHg despite continuous infusion of norepinephrine and dopamine. The patient experienced a transient cardiac stand-still in the catheter laboratory； 15 min of cardiopulmonary re-suscitation with chest compression and epinephrine injection was required for recovery of spontaneous circulation in the patient. We promptly introduced both extracorporeal mem-brane oxygenation with an initial flow rate of 2.5 L/min and intra-aortic balloon pump therapy to prevent hemodynamic disruption. Coronary artery trees were free from any lesions with 250% diameter stenosis. The left ventriculogram pictured in Figure 1B displays global systolic dysfunction with an EF of22%. Because the patient experienced a tonic convulsion af-ter resuscitation， mild therapeutic hypothermia of 34℃ was initiated to protect his brain.\n\n【24】Shock persisted in the patient despite aggressive manage-ment. Between days 1 and 3 of treatment， the QRS width pro-gressively increased from 0.18 s to 0.44 s (Figure 2). By day 3， CRP levels reached 36.6 mg/dL and CK levels were 8，078 IU/L(Figure 3). This unfavorable clinical course was suggestive of extended and activated myocardial injury and inflammation，\n\n| Day1  | Day 2  | Day 3  | Day 4  | Day 11  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ⅱ  |  |  |  |  |\n| 全  |  |  | T口鸭  |  |\n| aVR  |  |  |  |  |\n| aVL  | M  |  |  |  |\n| V1  | M  |  |  |  |\n| avF  | M  |  |  |  |\n| V2  | M  | SA  |  |  |\n| V3AALNN  | M  | AA  |  |  |\n| V4HN  |  | 人儿人  |  |  |\n| V5ANN  |  | 二似  |  | 1C  |\n| V6  | NA  |  |  |  |\n| QRS width (s}0.18  | 0.24  | 0.44  | 0.18  | 0.14  |\n\n【26】Figure 3.

CK-creatinine kinase； CRP -C-reactive protein； LVEF - left ventricular ejection fraction； MP-methylprednisolone.\n\n【27】and the patient appeared to be close to cardiac death. Thus， on day 3， we initiated intravenous methylprednisolone at a dose of 1，000 mg/day for the purposes of immunosuppression and anti-inflammation. The methylprednisolone treatment was maintained for three days and then immediately terminated.\n\n【28】On day 4， the ventricular pacing rhythm was restored and the QRS width was decreased to 0.14 s， consistent with pre-admis-sion QRS width until day 11 (Figure 2). As shown in Figure 3， the CK levels declined sharply and returned to its normal limit until day 12. The time courses of the CRP and CK levels were similar. In accordance with improved myocardial injury and in-flammation， the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in the echocardiogram increased from 24% to 44%. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and intra-aortic balloon pump thera-py were discontinued on days 14 and 16， respectively.\n\n【29】Although the patient exhibited moderately impaired LV function， he survived and was discharged without any neurological deficits.\n\n【30】Discussion\n\n【31】In the present case， although endomyocardial biopsy could not be taken， the recent viral illness， rapid development of cardio-genic shock， failure of ventricular pacing and sensing， diffuse impairment of LV contraction， and absence of flow-limiting cor-onary stenosis were highly suggestive of fulminant myocardi-tis. To prevent hemodynamic collapse and enable the recov-ery of injured myocardium， intra-aortic balloon pump therapy and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are often used as adjuncts to optimized medical treatments and are consid-ered first-line treatments for severe cases of fulminant myo carditis \\[4-6\\]. The long-term prognosis of fulminant myocar-ditis can be favorable \\[1\\]； however， the mortality rate is high during acute stages of the illness.

Hsu et al. \\[5\\] demonstrated that 27of 75 patients (36%) treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation died during hospitalization. To decrease the rates of death and heart transplantation， development of alterna-tive therapeutic interventions is necessary to treat patients who do not respond to usual aggressive treatment regimens.\n\n【32】In this case， the progressive expansion of the QRS width and progressive elevation of CK and CRP levels suggested a clas-sification of the patient as a non-responder. A high dose of in-travenous methylprednisolone seemed effective based on the results that followed. Failed ventricular pacing and sensing\n\n【33】recovered within 24 h， and the QRS width had decreased to baseline levels for a brief period after methylprednisolone treat-ment. The time courses of the CK and CRP levels also exhibit-ed sharp declines， which were associated with improved LVEF.\n\n【34】Immunosuppressive treatments，including prednisone and aza-thioprine， are reportedly effective for the recovery of LV systolic function in patients who exhibit virus-negative inflammatory cardiomyopathy \\[7\\]. In contrast， the use of immunosuppres-sion to treat acute myocarditis has led to controversial re-sults. Myocarditis is associated with a wide spectrum of clini-cal presentations， which may explain inconsistent results. No large clinical studies have examined the effects that immu-nosuppression has on the functional and clinical outcomes of fulminant myocarditis； however， several case reports and a small clinical study have highlighted the benefits of corti-costeroid treatment \\[3，8-10\\]. In acute viral myocarditis， the major mechanisms that underlie tissue injury differ depend-ing on the time elapsed from viral exposure \\[6，11\\]. Viral rep-lication directly causes myocardial necrosis during the acute phase over a period of few days. After the acute phase， the activated immune system plays a major role in subsequent\n\n【35】References：\n\n【36】1\\.

Activation of cytokines and creation of auto-antibod-ies against cardiac proteins also may also contribute to tis-sue injury. Immunosuppression may enhance viral replication and thus have deleterious effects during the acute phase. In contrast， immunosuppression may be beneficial during subse-quent phases. Because methylprednisolone inhibited progres-sive aggravation of clinical findings and improved LV function and inflammation， the abrupt collapse of hemodynamics that occurred in our patient most likely developed in response to an immune-mediated myocardial injury.\n\n【44】Conclusions\n\n【45】We present intravenous methylprednisolone as an attractive therapeutic option for patient with fulminant myocarditis that is refractory to optimal medical treatment and mechanical cir-culatory support.

The headache was severe， persistent， with no special character， and with no exacerbating or relieving fac-tors. The headache severity gradually increased over a 1-week period， with no improvement following analgesia. The blurring of vision and diplopia were mostly on her leftward gaze. She denied any history of fever， photophobia， neck stiffness， skin rash， or recent travel. However， an episode of varicella infection in her childhood was reported by her parents， with no history of Zoster. Apart from that， her medical history was unremark-able. She was not taking any medications or oral contracep-tive pills. Her family history is not significant.\n\n【34】On examination， the patient was alert， oriented， and overweight， with a BMI of 28 kg/m2.

Cranial nerves exami-nations were normal except for left abducent nerve palsy and diplopia in both right and left gaze. The rest of her full neuro-logical assessment was within normal limits. Her blood tests revealed normal renal， liver， and bone biochemistry. Normal in-flammatory markers (C-reactive protein and Erythrocyte sedi-mentation rate) and white cell count of 5.3×103 per mm’were41% neutrophils， 45% lymphocytes， 11.4% monocytes， 1.3%eosinophils， and 0.4% basophils.\n\n【40】Imaging studies including chest x-ray， computed tomography(CT)， MRI， and MRA of the brain failed to show any evidence of cerebral venous thrombosis， vasculitis， or other abnormalities.\n\n【41】Lumber puncture revealed an opening pressure was 53 cm of water (normal opening pressure 10-20 cm of H，0)， 537 white blood cells， with the following differential (lymphocytes 96%， monocytes 3% and segmented 1%)， 17 red cells/mm， pro-tein of 62mg/dL (normal protein 15-45 mg/dL)， and glucose of2.3 mmol/L (blood glucose of 6mmol/L). Gram stain， Indian ink for Cryptococcal neoformans capsule and CSF cultures were negative\n\n【42】CSF cytology did not demonstrate any malignant cells， and CSF polymerase chain reactions (PCR) for herpes simplex virus l and ll， enterovirus， cytomegalovirus， Epstein-Barr virus， adenovirus mumps， Parecho virus， and TB were negative. A positive VZV\n\n【43】DNA PCR was detected in the CSF sample， but plasma serolo-gy for human immunodeficiency virus (HV) was nonreactive.\n\n【44】The patient was treated with Ⅳ Acyclovir for 14 days together with Acetazolamide 250 mg PO BID. Her symptoms resolved gradually with complete recovery of her diplopia and head-ache. She was discharged home following a normal paramet-ric visual study and instructed to have a regular ophthalmol-ogy follow-up for her papilledema.\n\n【45】Discussion\n\n【46】Reactivated VZV can cause wide varieties of neurologic dis-ease \\[2，3\\]. The discovery of PCR increases the detection rate in diagnosis of viral meningitis due to herpes simplex type 2(HSV-2) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) \\[11\\].\n\n【47】Several studies conducted in patients with herpes zoster have demonstrated that subclinical meningeal irritation can occur in 40-50% of cases \\[12，13\\]， but a careful review of the liter-ature showed that VZV-related neurologic disease can occur without the classic herpes zoster exanthema， even in immu-nocompetent patients. There are several reported cases about VZV reactivation； Klein et al. reported on a 14-year-old a pa-tient with the same clinical presentation but lacking symptoms and signs of increased intracranial pressure \\[14\\].\n\n【48】Moreover， 6 cases of VZV meningitis confirmed by PCR have been reported， and those cases failed to show any skin mani-festation \\[15\\]. This may confirm the ability of the latent virus in the spinal ganglia to travel directly to the central nervous system without the classical skin involvement.\n\n【49】The present case demonstrates the same phenomenon， but with increased intracranial pressure as a predominant clinical feature. The mechanism behind this increase remains poorly understood. However， this can be explained by one of the postulated theories， where superimposed infection of baseline subclinical pseudotu-mor cerebri or caused primarily by the VZV meningitis. Further explanation suggested by Lo et al. is the post-infectious allergic response to the causative virus and diffuse brain swelling \\[16\\]. In their series of 3 cases of aseptic meningitis with similar compli-cations， the causative virus was not identified in 2 cases， while in the third case evidence of herpes infection was detected. In the present case， the viral etiology was proven. Similar to our case， complications appeared at between 11 and 16 days from the start of the illness. Table 1 summarizes the previous case re-ports of aseptic meningitis with neurological complications and compares it with the present case presentation.\n\n【50】The high opening pressure in our patient (53 cm of water) com-pared to previous reported cases may favor the first theory\n\n【51】References：\n\n【52】1\\.

However， the dramatic response to antiviral medication sug-gests that aseptic meningitis was the direct cause of her symp-toms. Moreover， a recently published review concluded that reactivation of herpes simplex virus isoform 1 (HSV-1)and/or herpes zoster virus (HZV) from the geniculate ganglia is the most strongly suspected cause of isolated Bell’s palsy \\[17\\].\n\n【66】Another theory describes Bell's palsy as an acute demyelinat-ing disease， which may have a pathogenic mechanism similar to that of Guillain-Barre syndrome \\[18，19\\]. It has been sug-gested that they both represent an inflammatory demyelin-ating neuritis in which Bell’s palsy can be considered a mo-no-neuritic variant of Guillain-Barre \\[19，20\\]. This may partially explain the involvement of the abducent never in this case， but fails to clarify the increased cranial pressure.\n\n【67】Conclusions\n\n【68】This case demonstrates that VZV may be considered in cas-es of aseptic meningitis in immune-competent individuals， even without exanthema， and it may increase the intracrani-al pressure， leading to symptoms and causing reversible neu-rological deficit.\n\n【69】11\\.

Histologically is characterised by\n\n【8】capsular fibrosis， histiocytes and plasma cells proliferation， lymphogranulocytosis. SHML is classified as class\n\n【9】II histiocytosis (according to WHO). The disease is considered to be a disorder ofimmune regulation or a reac-tion to certain infectious factors. Clinically， radiologically and histopathologically， SHML requires differentia-tion with sarcoidosis， Hodgkin’s disease， Langerhans histiocytosis， granulomatous disease， lipid storage disor\n\n【10】ders and non-specific inflammations. The clinical outcome varies from spontaneous remission to diverse\n\n【11】responses to the treatment applied. We present this case for the reason of rarity and immunophenotypic differ-ences from other histiocytosis.\n\n【12】Case report： We present a multiple organ form ofSHML in a 7 year girl with massive enlargement of cervical\n\n【13】lymph nodes. Histopatologic examination ofa lymph node revealed a proliferation of histiocytes and plasma\n\n【14】cells， lymphophagocytosis， presence of S-100 protein， negative reaction for CD1 and HL4-DR， electron\n\n【15】microscopy negative for the Birbeck granules. The bone examination showed numerous osteolytic loss in the\n\n【16】upper and lower limb bones with silmilar histopatologic changes. Due to multiple organ involvement treatment\n\n【17】with prednisolone and vinblastine was instituted to obtain a reduction in lymphadenopathy and regression of\n\n【18】bony ailments. The patient completed therapy two years ago with no evidence of disease.\n\n【19】Conclusions： Sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy (SHML)- represents a rare cause of lym-phadenopathy and should be considered in the differential diagnosis expecially with LCH.\n\n【20】BACKGROUND\n\n【21】Sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy(SHML) is a rare， benign lymphoproliferative disor-der， characterised by slowly progressing lympha-denopathy mainly in the cervical area， accompanied by bouts of fever， leukocytosis with neutrophilia， hypergammaglobulinaemia， elevated erythrocyte sed-imentation rate and mild hypochromic anaemia \\[1，2\\].\n\n【22】Histopathologically， it manifests in capsular fibrosis， proliferation of histiocytes and plasma cells， lym-phophagocytosis and more rarely erythrophagocyto-sis \\[3\\]. The disease is considered to be a disorder of immune regulation or a reaction to certain infectious factors (viral - CMS， HIV， RSV， EBV， rubella； sel-dom bacterial factors， tuberculosis， brucellosis).\n\n【23】CASE REPORT\n\n【24】A 7-year-old girl (M.J. case history no 3016/299) was admitted to the Department for massive enlargement of cervical lymph nodes lasting for approximately six months， not responding to antibiotic therapy， with occasional fever bouts.

Osteolytic loss in the metaphyses of the both ulnar bones， left radius metacarpals and left hand phalanges.\n\n【29】examination， apart from painless， relatively firm cer-vical lymph nodes， bean to plum in size， showed micro-macular rash on the trunk and arms， and bilat-eral nasal obstruction caused by nodules covered with unchanged mucous membrane， being more pro-nounced on the right side. Laboratory investigations revealed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate，61/122； leukocytosis， 15.1/mm， with the predomi-nance of neutrophilic granulocytes， 77%； elevated values of IgG， 21.3 1/1， IgA， 1.72 g/l， IgM， 1.88 g/l； increased total protein， 8.4 g/dl at normal proteino-gram； in flow cytometry， Th-Ts cell ratio inversion，0.9%， and increased percentage of NK cells， 17.4%. Serologic tests for anti-CMV， RSV， EBV， HCV， HBV， rubella， toxoplasmosis and mycosis antibodies， and intracutaneous test for tuberculosis were nega-tive. Radiologic examinations of the bony system showed numerous osteolytic loss in the upper and lower limb bones (in the metaphyses of the proximal right humeral bone， both ulnar bones， left radius， metacarpals and left hand phalanges， left sphenoid bone， with a slight osteosclerotic reaction in the fibula and right talus). The sizes of the foci ranged from 5 to14 mm， some of which were cystomatous， with no periosteal reaction (Figure 1). Ultrasonographic investigations and computerised tomography (CT) showed calcareous deposits in the left kidney (the largest size， 9x6 mm)， most likely associated with enhanced osteolysis. The serum concentrations of\n\n【30】Figure 2. Proliferation of histiocytes nad plasma cells， lymphofagocy-tosis with reaction for CD 68.\n\n【31】total and ionised calcium and daily calcium excretion with urine were normal.\n\n【32】Histopathologic examination of a lymph node and bone section revealed proliferation of histiocytes and plasma cells， lymhophagocytosis and the presence of S-100 protein， with negative reaction for CD1 and HLA-DR (Figure 2). No Birbeck granules were seen in the electron microscope. The above picture corre sponds to Rosai-Dorfman disease classified as class II histiocytosis according to WHO.\n\n【33】Due to multiple organ involvement treatment with prednisolone and vinblastine was instituted to obtain a reduction in lymphadenopathy and regression of bony ailments. The patient completed therapy two vears ago and remains in remission.\n\n【34】DISCUSSION\n\n【35】Sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy has a very broad clinical spectrum and varied out comes - from spontaneous remission to gradua lethal involvement of vital organs (7%) \\[4\\]. In approximately 83% of cases the diagnostic examina tion revealss massive， painless cervicallympha denopathy. Such general symptoms as fever and loss of weight， also demonstrated by our patient， are fre-quent \\[1，2\\]. Laboratory findings are non-specific； we found an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate， leukocytosis with the predominance of granulocytes， elevated concentration of blood platelets， protein disorders (slight albumin reduction and increased immunoglobulin concentration). Our patient pre sented considerably increased concentrations of IgG， IgA and IgM， Th-Ts cell ratio inversion - like in other described cases \\[2，5\\]. Extranodal involvement refers to approximately 30% of patients and can affect any organ. Changes in bones， the nervous sys-\n\n【36】tem， alimentary tract and kidneys are rare \\[5-7\\].In the case described， numerous osteolytic foci， with no periosteal reaction， were observed both in the upper and lower limb bones； additionally the girl had three thoracic vertebrae lowered. Renal involvement accompanied by immune disorders frequently sho-wed unfavourable clinical course \\[4，7\\]. Diagnosis is based on characteristic histologic features， including(in nodal and extranodal involvement) proliferation of large histiocytes with features of activation and the presence of other cell lines such as plasma cells， lymphocytes， S-100 protein. Lymphophagocytosis is non-specific， yet considered a classical histologic fea-ture of SHML \\[1-3\\]. In the present case the micro-scopic picture of a lymph node and ulnar bone sec-tion fully corresponded to the criteria of Rosai-Dorfman disease. Clinically， radiologically and histopathologically， SHML requires differentiation with sarcoidosis， Hodgkin’s disease， Langerhans his-tiocytosis， granulomatous disease， lipid storage disor-ders and non-specific inflammations - excluded in our patient \\[2，5\\]. The clinical outcome varies from spontaneous remission to diverse responses to the treatment applied. Reports on the type of treatment are not consistent and the outcomes unsatisfactory. Antibiotics， irradiation， local surgery， combination of vinblastine， alkylating drugs and steroids have been used. Some authors underline poor efficacy of podophylotoxine derivatives \\[5，8\\]. However， no effective therapy rules have been established yet. Further understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease may help to find an effective way of thera-peutic management.\n\n【37】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【38】1\\. SHML is a well recognised， but rare cause of lym phadenopathy in the first decade of life.\n\n【39】2\\. Very heterogenous course is observed and progno sis is unclear.\n\n【40】3\\.

We present a case of a patient who developed reversible dilated cardiomyopathy secondary to their use.\n\n【24】Case Report： A 27 year old male with no past medical history was brought to emergency department with agitation. He had been inhaling and intravenously injecting \"bath salts”， containing a mephedrone/ Methylenedioxypyrovalerone(MDPV) combination. On presentation， he was tachycardic， hypotensive and febrile. His initial labs showed an elevated white count， creatinine and creatinine phosphokinase levels. His erythrocyte sedimentation rate； C-reactive protein； urinalysis； urine drug screen； Human Immunodeficiency Virus， hepatitis， coxsackie， and in-fluenza serology were normal. EKG showed sinus tachycardia. An echocardiogram was done which showed di-lated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20% and global hypokinesia. A left heart catheteriza-tion was done and was negative for coronary artery disease. At a 20 week follow up， he had stopped abusing bath salts and was asymptomatic. A repeat echocardiogram showed an EF of 52%.\n\n【25】Cocnlusions： Bath salts (MDPV， mephedrone) are synthetic cathinones with amphetamine/cocaine like properties with po-tential cardiotoxic effects. Cardiovascular manifestations reported include tachycardia， hypertension， myocardi-al infarction， arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. \"Bath salts” can also cause severe reversible dilated cardiomyopa-thy. Prior to diagnosis， other causes of cardiomyopathy including ischemic， infectious， familial， immunological， metabolic and cytotoxic may need to be ruled out； as was done in our patient.\n\n【26】Key words： dilated cardiomyopathy·3，4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone· mephedrone\n\n【27】Full-text PDF http：//www.amjcaserep.com/download/index/idArt/889381\n\n【28】“Bath salt” is the street name for a group of synthet-ic cathinones that are emerging drugs of abuse. Two ma-jor pharmacological constituents of these drugs are MDPV(Methylenedioxypyrovalerone) and mephedrone \\[1\\]. They are becoming increasingly common and are a rising cause of emer-gency room visits， fatalities and affect multiple organ systems. The use of “Bath salts\" has not been previously associated with the development of cardiomyopathy.\n\n【29】Case Report\n\n【30】A 27 year old male with no past medical history was brought to the emergency department with complaints of severe agitation. In spite of being very agitated and violent， he was oriented to time， place and person and was able to provide a good history. He was not complaining of chest pain， dyspnea， orthopnea， re-cent febrile illnesses or syncope. His review of systems was neg-ative. He had been inhaling and intravenously injecting a combi-nation of MDPV/mephedrone a few hours before presentation. The patient had brought the substance abused with him，though the amount of substance used was not known. He was not on any medications， had an unremarkable family history and de-nied use of other drugs， alcohol or tobacco. On examination， he was tachycardic (117 bpm)， mildly hypotensive (90/60 mmHg) and febrile (101.2F). He had trace pedal edema and track marks on the left antecubital area. Cardiovascular exam was normal with no jugular venous distention， murmurs or added sounds. Lungs were clear. Laboratory findings included WBC-14.6x10/mcl； Hemoglobin-11 g/dl； Platelets-118x10/mcl； Creatinine-2.33 mg/dl；CPK-723 U/l，myoglobin-220 mg/dl and lactate-2.8 mmol/l. Electrolytes were normal with an anion gap of 10. ABG showed mild acidosis with pH of 7.30. Troponins； erythro-cyte sedimentation rate； C-reactive protein； urinalysis； urine drug screen， blood alcohol and cortisol levels were normal/negative. EKG showed sinus tachycardia. Chest Xray did not reveal any acute processes. His blood pressure continued to remain low on day 2and a potential cardiogenic shock was suspected and an echo-cardiogram was done. It showed dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20% and global hypokinesia (Figure1). His blood pressure continued to drop requiring vasopressor support with low dose intravenous norepinephrine for duration of less than 6 hours. Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) was consis-tently kept over 60 mm Hg at all times. Human Immunodeficiency Virus， Hepatitis， Coxsackie， and Influenza serology were normal. He improved clinically with conservative management and was discharged in a stable， asymptomatic condition after extensive counselling against bath salt use on day 5. He had an outpa-tient ischemia workup immediately after discharge that includ-ed a left heart catheterization that was negative for coronary artery disease. At a 20 week follow up， he was doing well， was\n\n【31】asymptomatic and had stopped abusing bath salts. An echocar-diogram was repeated at this time and showed an EF of 52%with significant improvement in hypokinesia.\n\n【32】Discussion\n\n【33】“Bath salts\" are synthetic cathinones and are structurally de-rived from amphetamines \\[1\\]. Their popularity primarily began in Europe beginning in 2007-08. By the end of the year 2011， it was recognized as an emerging public health threat by the national poison center's data system \\[2\\]. In October 2011，leg-islation was passed classifying both mephedrone and MDPV as Schedule I drugs. However， in 2012， even after active legis-lation， approximately 2600 exposures were still documented by the AAPCC (American Association of Poison Control Centers)\\[3\\]. There is no mandatory reporting for “bath salt\" exposures and this number may simply be the tip of the iceberg.\n\n【34】They are usually ingested or insufflated， though rectal， intra-venous and intramuscular abuse has also been reported \\[4\\]. The regular urine drug screen is likely to be negative in the set-ting of “bath salt\" use. Urinary analysis using liquid chroma-tography and mass spectrometry has been shown to be effec-tive in the identification of “bath salts\" in the urine \\[5\\] as has analysis with flow injection analysis and mass spectrometry\\[6\\]. However， these are all new and expensive techniques and have not been thoroughly validated. They can be used when a good history of definitive use is not available.\n\n【35】They are commonly reported to cause central nervous system effects including agitation， seizures， hyperthermia， paranoid psychosis \\[7\\] excited delirium \\[8\\]，posterior reversible enceph-alopathy syndrome \\[9\\]， serotonin syndrome \\[10\\] and depen-dence \\[11\\]. They are also associated with methemoglobinemia\\[12\\] and acute kidney injury \\[13\\] which can be direct or sec-ondary to rhabdomyolysis \\[8\\]. Several studies have also found associations with death \\[14，15\\]\n\n【36】The most common cardiovascular effects however， are hyperten-sion and tachycardia \\[2\\]. Animal studies have shown responses similar to methamphetamines with increased stroke volume， in-creased cardiac output without a direct pro-arrhythmic effect \\[16\\].\n\n【37】This patient presented with severe cardiomyopathy and car-diogenic shock. The causes for cardiomyopathy considered initially included ischemic， infectious， immunological， famil-ial， metabolic versus cytotoxic.\n\n【38】The patient was very young， did not smoke and had no family history or other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. However， since occult disease has been reported to cause cardiomyop-athy in a significant percentage of patients， ischemic causes\n\n【39】Figure 1. Serial echocardiographic findings： (A， B) diastolic and systolic images at presentation； (C， D) diastolic and systolic images at20 week follow up. LV -left ventricle.\n\n【40】were definitively ruled out with a cardiac catheterization \\[17\\]. The catheterization revealed clean coronaries and a depressed ejection fraction of 20%.\n\n【41】His troponins remained negative and he had no electrocardio-graphic changes making myocarditis as well as stress induced cardiomyopathy an unlikely scenario. The pattern of hypoki-nesia was global， which is atypical for stress induced cardio-myopathy. Also， he did not meet the Mayo clinic criteria \\[18\\].\n\n【42】Reversal of cardiomyopathy at 20 weeks argues against a connec-tive tissue related， hypertensive or infiltrative cause for his car-diomyopathy. He did not consume alcohol (blood alcohol levels were also negative at admission)， did not smoke， did not use co-caine and had never been on chemotherapy. Established causes of toxic cardiomyopathy were therefore also deemed unlikely.\n\n【43】Patient's fever and tachycardia resolved after the first day and the tachycardia was not out of proportion to the fever. He\n\n【44】also did not have evidence of pericardial involvement， mus-cle aches or any other systemic manifestations that may have suggested an infectious cause for his cardiomyopathy. Human Immunodeficiency Virus， Hepatitis， Coxsackie， and Influenza serology were also negative. It is not possible to serologically confirm the lack of every infectious cause of cardiomyopathy， though there was no clinical necessity to run any further testing.\n\n【45】Serological or urine testing for \"Bath Salt\" and in this patient for mephedrone or MDPV was not undertaken as it was felt to be unnecessary given the good history. Also， the lack of easy avail-ability， cost and the lack of thorough validation of these tests also played a role in the decision to not go ahead with the testing.\n\n【46】Heart failure and cardiogenic shock， as in the patient described above is an uncommon effect of bath salt abuse. The exact mechanism is unknown， though adrenergic excess may play a role. However， the pattern of presentation was not similar to stress induced cardiomyopathy (also known as takotsubo\n\n【47】cardiomyopathy) as pointed out earlier. Serial clinical assess-ment and echocardiograms can help monitor cardiac function. Abstinence from bath salts may be a good prognostic sign in this regard.\n\n【48】Conclusions\n\n【49】Even after legislation against their sale and use， “bath salts\"continue to be rampantly abused. They affect multiple organ\n\n【50】References：\n\n【51】1\\. Gerona R， Wu A： Bath Salts. Clin Lab Med.， 2012；32：415-27\n\n【52】2\\.

Performing endoscopic surgery can in-crease the amount of information intraoperatively. We report on our experience of proactively using endos-copy to obtain additional intraoperative information to perform the appropriate surgical procedure suited to each female genital malformation， and evaluate the usefulness of concurrent endoscopy for improved surgi-caloutcomes.\n\n【33】Case Reports：\n\n【34】In Case 1， an 18-year-old woman underwent colpoplasty for Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuister-Hauser syndrome using the laparoscopic Davydov procedure， wherein the pelvic peritoneum was precisely dissected using light from a laparoscope as a guide. In Case 2， a 25-year-old woman presented with suspected Wunderlich syndrome. Since the junction of the affected uterus with the normal uterus was unclear on preoperative imaging， we performed total hysterectomy of the affected uterus after identifying the anatomical structure by hysteroscopy In Case3， a 12-year-old girl with obstructed hemivagina and ipsilateral renal anomaly (OHVIRA) syndrome underwent transvaginal fenestration of the obstructed vaginal wall to prevent future menstrual molimen. Simultaneous hysteroscopy and laparoscopy allowed us to determine the location of a unilateral vaginal wall cyst and drain it safely. In Case 4， a 29-year-old woman had OHVIRA syndrome， and we conducted a laparoscope-based fen-estration of the cervical canal safely and accurately.\n\n【35】Conclusions： Our series showed how， even for gynecological malformations without established standards for surgical pro-cedure， a safe and minimally invasive surgery can be ensured if the amount of anatomical information is in-creased via endoscopy.\n\n【36】Keywords： Endoscopy· Genitalia， Female · Mullerian Ducts· Solitary Kidney\n\n【37】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/934363\n\n【38】口22184 4 31\n\n【39】Malformations of the female genital organs in adolescence and the reproductive years require surgery in some cases to improve functioning and quality of life. Due to the rarity of such cases， there are no established standardized surgeries \\[1\\]. Therefore， it is difficult to develop typical surgical approach-es and conduct preoperative evaluation. At our hospital， we proactively use endoscopy to obtain additional intraoperative information to perform the appropriate surgical procedure suited to each individual patient. We retrospectively evaluat-ed the usefulness of concurrent endoscopy for improved sur-gical outcomes in 4 patients who had undergone surgery for female genital malformations at our hospital.\n\n【40】Case Reports\n\n【41】Case 1\n\n【42】Case 1 involved an 18-year-old woman whose main problem was primary amenorrhea. Medical and imaging examinations revealed vaginal aplasia with rudimentary uterus， and she was diagnosed with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuister-Hauser (MRKH) syn-drome (Figure 1A， 1B). After dilating the vaginal orifice for 2years using a Hegar dilator， surgery was performed.\n\n【43】Figure 1. (Case 1).

(C) Intraoperative findings revealed that blood vessel damage could be avoided by advancing the scope to the blind end of the vagina between the bladder and rectum and then bluntly dissecting the connective tissue between the bladder and rectum in the direction of the light.(D) Use of the light of the laparoscope as a landmark for blunt dissection of the connective tissue between the bladder and rectum from the vaginal side.\n\n【45】Surgical Procedure： Laparoscopy-Assisted Colpoplasty(Laparoscopic Davydov Procedure)\n\n【46】First， laparoscopy revealed a rudimentary uterus， and then the laparoscope was guided to the end of the peritoneum between the bladder and rectum (Figure 1C). Using the light from the lap-aroscope through the vagina as a landmark (Figure 1D)， the vul-var vestibule was sectioned and the connective tissue between the bladder and rectum was bluntly dissected from the vagi-nal side. After reaching the pelvic peritoneum， a Cusco's spec-ulum was inserted into the vagina and was opened in up-down and left-right motions to sufficiently dissect the surrounding tissue from the pelvic peritoneum. After opening the peritone-al sac， the peritoneum was pulled to the vaginal side and su-tured to the vaginal opening. In this process， the blood vessels are clustered around the rudimentary uterus in patients with MRKH syndrome， so it is important to carefully evaluate the running of the vessels that are in close proximity (Figure 1C). Thereafter， a prosthesis was inserted into the newly created\n\n【47】vagina， and the superior portion of the pelvic peritoneum was closed laparoscopically， thereby forming the blind end of the va-gina. Prosthesis was used until the vaginal epithelium regener-ated， and then a dilator was used to prevent vaginal restenosis.\n\n【48】Case 2\n\n【49】Case 2 involved a 25-year-old woman who presented with uterus didelphys and right renal agenesis， and suspected Wunderlich syn-drome. The patient previously underwent resection of the vaginal wall and drainage for menstrual molimen， but her symptoms re-curred. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could not clearly iden-tify the positional relationship of the uterus didelphys (Figure 2A)； therefore， laparoscopic surgery was planned to assess the sub-ject's anatomy precisely and to perform proper drainage.\n\n【50】Surgical Procedure： Laparoscopic Hysterectomy of the Affected Side\n\n【51】Laparoscopic observations ascertained that the right affected uterus was connected to the parauterine connective tissue of\n\n【52】the left normal uterus by a cord-like structure (Figure 2B， 2C). The affected uterus was resected and removed laparoscopi-cally (Figure 2D). The absence of the right urinary tract due to agenesis of the right kidney was confirmed during surgery， and the operation was able to be performed without concern about possible ureteral injury. After surgery， there has been no recurrence of menstrual molimen.\n\n【53】Case 3\n\n【54】Case 3 involved a 12-year-old girl who reported excessive menstruation and lower abdominal pain. She presented with uterus didelphys， right vaginal closure， and right renal agene-sis. The obstruction was so extreme that hemivagina and ip-silateral renal anomaly (OHVIRA) syndrome was suspected(Figure 3A-3C). We decided to use palliative surgery to reach a diagnosis and improve symptoms.\n\n【55】Surgical Procedure： Laparoscopy-Assisted Vaginal Cyst Fenestration + Hysteroscopy Examination\n\n【56】Since the patient was 12 years old， had no history of sexual in-tercourse， and presented a narrow hymenal ring， insertion of a hysteroscope into the vagina allowed for vaginal reflux fluid fill-ing and distension of the vagina for intravaginal observation. Since hysteroscopy showed only the left os uteri， the right vag-inal wall cyst was not visible (Figure 3D). We therefore decided\n\n【57】to combine the hysteroscopy with laparoscopy. Laparoscopy con-firmed the presence of uterus didelphys (Figure 3E) and， in com-bination with the hysteroscopic findings， the presence of a right vaginal wall cyst.\n\n【58】The combination of laparoscopy and hysteroscopy allowed us to perform fenestration drainage of the vaginal wall cyst(Figure 3F) while keeping track of the position of the vaginal wall cyst and the rectum. Then， we widened the hole which we had fenestrated and placed a Nelaton catheter (Figure 3G， 3H). A biopsy of the cyst’s wall was obtained， and histopathological examination confirmed the presence of stratified squamous epithelium (Figure 3l)， which allowed us to diagnose OHVIRA syndrome. Even 1 year after surgery， patency was maintained and no menstrua. molimen was observed.\n\n【59】ImaedaK.et al：\n\n【60】Figure 3. (Case 3).

MRI revealed a duplex uterus and a hemorrhagic cyst in the cervix of the left uterus(Figure 4A-4C). Furthermore， the patient had left renal aplasia and was suspected to have OHVIRA syndrome.\n\n【63】Surgical Procedure： Laparoscopy-Assisted Vaginal Cervical Duct Fenestration + Pigmented Fluid Flow Test\n\n【64】We performed an exploratory transvaginal puncture at the site where we expected to find the uterine cervical cyst (Figure 4D). After injecting indigo carmine， pigment outflow from the left tubal fimbriae was laparoscopically confirmed (Figure 4E)， as-suring us that we could puncture safely and insert a cathe-ter into the cavity of the affected uterus. Such an approach\n\n【65】eliminated the risk of damage to the surrounding tissue with a scalpel， and ensured that at the same site as the exploratory puncture the cervical opening and fenestration could be per-formed safely and accurately (Figure 4F). Furthermore， achieving sufficient fenestration allowed insertion of a Nelaton catheter(Figure 4G). Specifically， we used a “Robinson Nelaton cathe-ter A 13EG，\" which is relatively large， with an external diam-eter of 7.5 mm. The catheter was left in place for 1 month af-ter the surgery， and the fenestrated vaginal wall has remained free of stenosis for 2 years after the surgery. The pathologi-cal examination of the fenestrated vaginal wall showed strat-ified squamous epithelium (Figure 4H)， which led to the diag-nosis of OHVIRA syndrome.\n\n【66】Discussion\n\n【67】Female genital plastic surgery is very rare and there are no standard surgical techniques. Therefore， we performed endos-copy to gather additional information during surgery to ensure that the procedure was appropriate to each individual case. Here， we report our surgical precautions and emphasize the potential of endoscopic surgery to inspire surgery for various other female genital deformities.\n\n【68】In Case 1， some tips regarding the laparoscopic Davydov pro-cedure for MRKH syndrome were demonstrated. MRKH syn-drome is characterized by primary amenorrhea， congenital vaginal aplasia， and bilateral rudimentary uterus \\[2-4\\].MRKH syndrome develops due to abnormal differentiation of the Mullerian ducts during the embryonic phase， but the precise cause remains unclear. The primary goal of treatment is to re-store sexual function by performing colpoplasty. Various tech-niques are available \\[5-7\\]， and new methods are constantly being devised. Using Frank's method， the mucosa of the vagi-nal vestibule is stretched using a device \\[6，8\\]. The most com-mon method is the Mclndoe procedure \\[9\\]， wherein a skin graft from the abdomen， buttocks， or femoral region is used to create an artificial vagina. In the Ruge procedure \\[10，11\\]， the\n\n【69】Figure 4. (Case 4). (A) MRI findings (T2-weighted imaging， axial plane)： Duplicated uterus was observed.

(C) Schematic representation of the genital organs seen in Case 4.(D) Exploratory puncture was performed at the site where the uterine cervical cyst was expected， and indigo carmine was injected.

(H) Histology of the fenestrated vaginal wall， composed of stratified squamous epithelium.\n\n【70】sigmoid colon is used to create a vagina. In the Davydov pro-cedure \\[12\\]， the pelvic peritoneum is used. The Davydov pro-cedure is minimally invasive and aesthetically pleasing， and enables sexual intercourse early after surgery. Furthermore， in recent years， colpoplasty combined with laparoscopic surgery performed to reduce the invasiveness associated with open surgery has gained widespread popularity， and primarily in-volves the laparoscopic Davydov procedure \\[12-15\\]. For these reasons， we selected the laparoscopic modified Davydov pro-cedure for our patient. As mentioned above， the surgery was successfully performed owing to the creative use of the instru-ments in ways that differed from their original purpose， such as moving freely and directing the laparoscope's light to land-mark the direction of peritoneal dissection， as well as the use of opening and closing movements of the Cusco's speculum to dissect the peritoneum.\n\n【71】In Case 2， the patient presented with Wunderlich syndrome. In 1971， reported cases of uterus didelphys presenting with communicating intrauterine cavity and renal agenesis on the same side as Gartner's duct cysts were termed Herlyn-Werner syndrome. In 1976， cases of duplex uterus accompanied by paracervical cysts (non-communicating unicornuate uterus) and ipsilateral renal agenesis were reported as Wunderlich\n\n【72】syndrome \\[16-19\\]. At present， cases of duplex uterus， double vagina， obstructed hemivagina， ipsilateral renal agenesis，and cervical cysts are reported as Herlyn-Werner-Wunderlich syn-drome (HWWS) \\[16，18，20，21\\]. Symptoms of HWWS often in-clude lower abdominal pain gradually increasing after menarche and lower abdominal masses in adolescence \\[22\\]. Treatment for hematometrocolpos involves resection of the vaginal sep tum and transvaginal drainage of the blood. Recurrent hema-tometra caused by recurrent obstruction of the vaginal septum increases the risk of exacerbation of dysmenorrhea，and endo-metriosis can develop from the reverse flow of menstrual blood and endometrial cell transplantation (Sampson's transplant the-ory) \\[23，24\\]， which is likely to lead to infertility. In Wunderlich syndrome， there have been many reported cases of restenosis and recurrence attributed to the fact that the cervical orifice is simply opened and formed \\[17\\]. Therefore， long-term regular follow-up observations and attention to repeated obstructions at the site of the vaginal wall fenestration are important \\[25\\].In Case 2， we reported the process by which we were able to se-lect the appropriate laparoscopic procedure for a patient with a subtype of anatomical anomaly similar to Wunderlich syn-drome. In this case， a duplicated uterus and renal agenesis of the affected side with recurrent menstrual molimen were ob-served. Although Wunderlich syndrome was suspected，preop-erative diagnosis was difficult because MRI did not show a clear anatomical position of the affected uterus with menstrual mo-limen. By performing laparoscopic surgery not only for treat-ment but also for diagnosis， we were able to clarify the pre-cise anatomy of the affected uterus. In this case， we revealed that， unlike typical Wunderlich syndrome， the right affected uterus was connected with the parauterine connective tissue of the left normal uterus by a cord-like structure. Discovery of the precise anatomical structure by intraoperative laparoscopy was useful for determining the appropriate surgical procedure. The patient had repeated menstrual molimen， and she had 2children， so we decided to perform a radical surgery.\n\n【73】OHVIRA syndrome， present in Cases 3 and 4， manifests with uterus didelphys， double vagina (accompanied by vaginal he-matoma caused by obstruction on the affected side)， and renal hypoplasia \\[25-27\\]. The syndrome is caused by im-paired development of the Wolffian duct and non-fusion of the Mullerian ducts during the embryonic phase， with an in-cidence of 0.16-10% among malformations of the Mullerian ducts \\[28，29\\]. Clinical symptoms often include lower abdom-inal pain and dysmenorrhea \\[30，31\\]， and treatment general-ly involves transvaginal fenestration of the obstructed vaginal wall to relieve symptoms and preserve fertility. The final diag-nosis is confirmed by histopathological analysis of vaginal tis-sue obtained by biopsy during drainage of the hematoma \\[25\\].\n\n【74】When histopathological diagnosis reveals stratified squamous epithelium on both the obstructed and non-obstructed sides of the vaginal wall， OHVIRA syndrome is confirmed. In Case3， the patient was young， and the first step was to perform a minimally invasive surgery for symptom relief and diagnosis. Concurrent hysteroscopy and laparoscopy allowed us to diag-nose OHVIRA syndrome and perform a vaginal wall cyst fen-estration to prevent future menstrual molimen. Preoperative images showed a duplicated uterus， right renal agenesis， and right vaginal wall cyst， and we considered the possibility of OHVIRA syndrome or Wunderlich syndrome. Initially， a hys-teroscopy was performed， but the location of the vaginal wall cyst was unknown and puncture drainage could not be per-formed. Therefore， by combining hysteroscopy with laparos-copy， we were able to determine the anatomy of the vaginal wall cyst and its relation to the rectum and safely perform fen-estration drainage. In Case 4， a duplicated uterus and left ex-ternal orifice obstruction with a hemorrhagic cyst in the left cervical area were identified. Moreover， the left cervical duct needed to be opened for menstrual molimen. The blind vag-inal procedure alone was considered unsafe because of the risk of injury to the surrounding tissue. Therefore， we decided to use laparoscopic assistance. In this case， exploratory punc-ture of the cervical cyst was performed in combination with laparoscopy， thereby enabling sufficient opening and fenes-tration of the cervix at the same site， as well as insertion of a large Nelaton catheter to prevent restenosis.\n\n【75】Conclusions\n\n【76】Female genital malformations are rare and they present with myriad variations； hence， there is no standardized surgery to address them. If surgical treatment is chosen， it is important to refer to the literature. However， each appropriate surgical procedure must be selected on a case-by-case basis， and pre-operative imaging examinations are also useful. More anatom-ical information can be obtained intraoperatively by utilizing laparoscopy so that a surgical procedure fully tailored to each individual can be successfully achieved. While surgery for fe male genital malformations is rare， we believe that it can be performed safely in the future by performing laparoscopic sur-gery and confronting the important factors that require cau-tion intraoperatively during surgery.\n\n【77】Declaration of Figures’ Authenticity\n\n【78】All figures submitted have been created by the authors who confirm that the images are original with no duplication and have not been previously published in whole or in part.\n\n【79】1\\.

Rarely does the disease manifest with orolaryngeal symptoms before ocular ones. We present a case of MG that on initial presentation had symptoms of cranial nerves (CN) IXand X weakness， including dysphagia and dysphonia.\n\n【26】Case Report： A 51-year-old woman with panic attacks presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with complaints of her throat closing， swallowing difficulty， and hoarse voice. Multiple ED visits revealed no etiology. However， she developed stridor， which prompted further evaluation. Laryngoscopy and imaging studies revealed no gross abnormalities； therefore， her symptoms of dysphonia and difficulty breathing were attributed to anxiety. Her hospital course was complicated by a cardiac arrest requiring intubation. ECHO， CTA chest， and MRI brain were unremarkable. Her cardiac arrest was hypothesized as being secondary to laryngeal spasm. During her ICU course， she failed extubation multiple times due to acute respiratory failure. An autoimmune etiology was sus-pected， prompting a paraneoplastic screen， which revealed elevated levels of AChR antibodies at 124 mmol/L. MG was diagnosed and treatment with plasmapheresis and steroids was initiated. However， complications of thrombocytopenia， anemia， and ARDS ensued， so MG treatment was discontinued. The patient was eventually transferred to a LTACH. Thereafter， at outpatient followup， her MG was treated with mycophenolate and pred-nisone， which led to significant symptom improvement.\n\n【27】Conclusions：\n\n【28】MG commonly presents in the third decade with clinical features of ptosis， diplopia， and facial weakness. However， initial and isolated symptoms of dysphagia and dysphonia are rare， leading to missed diagnoses. Our case of a middle-aged woman posed a diagnostic challenge because of her uncommon presentation and co-morbidities of panic attacks and obesity. This case highlights the crucial need for a high index of clinical sus-picion for MG in any patient presenting with symptoms of CN IX and X weakness.\n\n【29】MeSH Keywords： Autoimmune Diseases of the Nervous System·Dysphonia· Neuromuscular Junction Diseases·\n\n【30】Receptors， Nicotinic\n\n【31】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/923750\n\n【32】目名11884 出E 山：的目 日1 10\n\n【33】Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease in which the body produces autoantibodies that bind to acetylcholine receptors on skeletal muscle， thus causing muscle weakness and fatiga-bility \\[1\\]. Common presenting symptoms include involvement of the ocular system， resulting in ptosis and diplopia. When the bulbar system is involved， patients present with dysar-thria， dysphagia， or dysphonia \\[1\\]， occurring in approximate-ly 15% of patients \\[10\\]. These symptoms commonly occur in the elderly and may be the only manifestations \\[2\\]. We dis-cuss an unusual presentation of myasthenia gravis present-ing with dysphagia and dysphonia in a middle-aged woman， posing a diagnostic challenge.\n\n【34】Case Report\n\n【35】A 51-year-old woman with a past medical history of severe anxiety and panic attacks presented to the ED multiple times for complaints of feeling her throat closing up， difficulty swal-lowing and speaking， and hoarseness in her voice. On her ini-tial ED visit， she was sent home on azithromycin for a pre-sumed upper-respiratory infection. She came back to the ED 1 week later with worsening symptoms and a new-onset rash. An allergic reaction to azithromycin was suspected and she was treated with epinephrine，diphenhydramine， and ste-roids， then was later discharged. Her dysphagia symptoms re-mained， leading to another ED visit， at which she reported per-sistent symptoms of difficulty breathing， throat closing， and occasional difficulty swallowing and speaking. She addition-ally reported progressive dysphagia to solids for 2-3 months， with intermittent hoarseness and stridor. Vitals were overall stable： afebrile (97.4°F \\[36.3°C\\])， BP 138/90， HR 88， saturating100% on room air. A physical exam showed an obese female in no distress， with adequate airway entry bilaterally and equal chest expansion. Chem-7 and complete blood count panel val-ues were all within normal range： WBC 7.85/nL， hemoglobin14.7 g/dL， platelets 146/nL， sodium 143 mmol/L， potassium3.2 mmol/L chloride 105 mmol/L， carbon dioxide 29 mmol/L， BUN 15 mg/Dl， creatinine 0.62， alkaline phosphatase 59 U/L， ALT 36 U/L， AST 13 U/L， and glucose 106 mg/dL. Results of a CXR were unremarkable.A CT scan of the soft tissue in her neck showed focal mucosal thickening within the sphenoid si-nus， but otherwise no abnormalities. The nasopharynx， oro-pharynx， hypopharynx， glottis， and subglottic trachea were normal. ENT was called to further evaluate the patient. A bed-side flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy examination revealed full-ness at the base of the tongue， with no evidence of asymme-try or obvious mass， posterior laryngeal edema suggestive of reflux disease， and pooling in the piriform sinuses suggesting poor swallowing. Her vocal cords were mobile bilaterally. There was no stridor and her airway appeared widely patent. At this\n\n【36】time， given a previous history of Helicobacter pylori infection， abdominal pain， and progressive dysphagia， a gastrointesti-nal etiology for her symptoms was being considered. She was admitted to the general medical floors for further evaluation.\n\n【37】In the following days， several rapid responses were called. The evening following admission， she experienced chest tight-ness and difficulty breathing. An EKG was done and was not significant for any new changes. Her symptoms were believed at the time to be due to her severe anxiety， and lorazepam was ordered， with subsequent improvement in her symptoms. The same night， rapid response was called again， as she ap-peared lethargic， with an extremely faint voice， whispering“l can't talk”. She received diphenhydramine for possible al-lergic reaction， and was placed on supplemental oxygen， sat-urating 100% on a 2-Lnasal cannula. Psychiatric consultation was requested for further evaluation of acute anxiety. Her family members at bedside revealed a history of anxiety and panic attacks occurring in the past 2-3 years since the death of the patient’s mother. Family members described her at-tacks as sudden inability to speak and episodes of her throat closing up. At this time， the diagnosis of conversion disorder was considered.\n\n【38】On the third day of hospitalization， another rapid response was called. She was observed sitting at the edge of the bed after ambulating from the bathroom， but looked uncomfort-able. She was pale and tachypneic with RR 40 and extreme-ly faint voice. She suddenly lost consciousness without any palpable pulses. CPR was immediately started， she was in-tubated， and ROSC was quickly achieved with compressions only. An EKG after arrest showed ventricular bigeminy， 15 beats of ventricular tachycardia， and then 3 minutes of accelerat-ed idioventricular rhythm. She was transferred to the ICU for further care. A cardiac etiology of her arrest was judged to be less likely. An echocardiogram showed normal LV and RV SyS-tolic function with no significant valvular abnormalities， and a cardiac catheterization done 3 months prior to presentation showed nonobstructive coronary arteries. Due to the sudden onset of shortness of breath， pulmonary embolism was also considered， but a CTA chest was unrevealing. An intracranial process was also considered due to her loss of consciousness. but a CT head was also unremarkable.Given the sequence of events and symptoms she experienced since admission， it was thought that she had laryngeal spasms causing significant hy-poxia， thus resulting in cardiac arrhythmia.\n\n【39】The following morning， she was extubated and within minutes developed acute respiratory failure， requiring immediate rein-tubation. During the intubation， visualization of her vocal cords showed normal anatomy with some arytenoid edema， so a ste-roid taper was initiated starting with intravenous dexameth-asone 4 mg 4 times daily. Gastroenterology was consulted to\n\n【40】evaluate esophageal abnormalities； however， given that she was intubated， an adequate work-up could not be done at the time. Extubation was attempted again； however， she was re-intubated within days due to tachypnea， hypoxia， and hyper-capnia. Arterial blood gas showed pH 7.0， pCO2 116，02 103， bicarbonate 29， and 02% 93% on a non-rebreather mask.\n\n【41】At this time， a paraneoplastic and autoimmune work-up for the etiology of her acute respiratory failure was performed. Surprisingly， acetylcholine receptor binding antibodies were elevated at 124 mmol/L (reference range <0.02 nmol/L)； thus， the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis was considered. Neurolog was consulted and plasma exchange with 3.6 L albumin was55initiated for a total plan of 5 sessions every other day. She was continued on intravenous steroids tapered down to hydrocor-tisone every 6 hours and subsequently to prednisone 60 mg daily. Given that she was sedated and mechanically ventilated， the response to treatment was unable to be appreciated in the acute setting. Her hospital course was further complicat-ed by sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome due to hospital-acquired multilobar pneumonia. Due to her sepsis， steroids were discontinued while she remained on antibiot-ics. She also experienced severe anemia and thrombocytope-nia requiring transfusions， and thus only completed 2 sessions of plasmapheresis before discontinuation. Her prolonged and complicated ICU stay eventually ended with placement of a tracheostomy and PEG tube and transfer to a long-term care facility. After completing her antibiotics， she resumed treat-ment with prednisone， with an up-titration of 10 mg every 5days starting at 10 mg and reaching a maintenance dose of60 mg for 2 months with a subsequent taper. She was soon maintained on treatment with prednisone 20 mg every other day， pyridostigmine 60 mg 3 times daily， and mycophenolate500 mg twice daily， with considerable improvement in her ini-tial bulbar symptoms.\n\n【42】Discussion\n\n【43】Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease in which the body produces autoantibodies against acetylcholine recep-tors on skeletal muscle， impairing transmission at the neu-romuscular junctions either by direct inhibition of acetylcho-line binding to the muscle or accelerating the degradation of acetylcholine receptors， thus decreasing the number of recep-tors. As a consequence， patients experience skeletal muscle weakness and fatigability. Clinical presentation of the disease varies widely among patients. Extraocular muscle weakness， diplopia， and ptosis are present in 90% of patients diagnosed with myasthenia gravis， being the initial complaint in about50% \\[2\\]. Surprisingly， our patient and her family members did not report any history of ocular symptoms， thus posing a di-agnostic challenge.\n\n【44】Myasthenia gravis can occur at any age， but typically occurs in a bimodal distribution. The peak incidence is at 30 years in females and 65 years in males \\[3\\]. Furthermore， myasthenia can be divided into late-onset and early-onset. Approximately65-70% of all MG cases are early-onset (<50 years)， where-as up to 30% are late-onset \\[3\\]. Late-onset myasthenia，peak-ing at 70-80 years in both sexes， frequently presents with bulbar symptoms such as dysphagia， dysphonia， and dysar-thria \\[4\\]， and ocular symptoms are less common. Dysphagia occurs in 15-40% of patients in generalized myasthenia， but it is uncommon for it to be the only manifestation of the dis-ease \\[5\\]. The diagnosis of myasthenia in a patient with these isolated symptoms should be considered. Unfortunately， our patient's history of severe anxiety and panic attacks， atypical age range， and atypical presentation with only bulbar symp-toms deterred us from considering an autoimmune etiology， thus delaying diagnosis.\n\n【45】About 20-30% of patients diagnosed with myasthenia gravis are affected by myasthenic crisis， and in some cases， this is the initial presentation \\[6\\]. In a study of 51 myasthenic patients， Quereshi et al. described 7 patients (approximately 14%) with no previous diagnosis of MG presenting with acute respiratory failure. Of these 7 patients， most demonstrated predominantly bulbar symptoms along with ocular involvement \\[7\\]. However， only 1 patient was found to have isolated bulbar involvement， similar to our patient， again posing a diagnostic challenge.\n\n【46】Identification of myasthenia gravis includes multiple approaches. Apart from clinical symptoms and physical examination find-ings， diagnostic testing includes presence of autoantibodies， slow repetitive nerve stimulation， and single-fiber electromy-ography. The most specific diagnostic test， and the test used in our case， is elevated acetylcholine receptor antibodies in the serum， which is positive in 85% of patients with generalized myasthenia and in only 50% of patients with only ocular my-asthenia gravis \\[8\\]. However， seronegative disease is not un-common， and the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis should not be overlooked. In fact， Renard et al. presented a case of laryn-geal myasthenia gravis in which the patient showed a lack of antibodies， normal repetitive nerve stimulation， and absence of extra-laryngeal involvement， whose symptoms improved upon initiation of therapy despite a negative myasthenia work-up\\[9\\].\n\n【47】It is rare to see acute respiratory failure as the presenting symp-tom of myasthenia gravis， as witnessed in our patient. It is reasonable to believe that her symptoms of myasthenia may have presented when she was diagnosed with anxiety， as she experienced symptoms of dysphagia and dysarthria during her assumed panic attacks. Unfortunately， it may have been left undiagnosed due to anchoring bias. In patients experiencing such a crisis， timely initiation of plasma exchange and intra-venous immunoglobulins reduces the duration of mechanical\n\n【48】ventilation \\[7\\]. Unfortunately， given our patient's complica-tions during her hospital course resulting in long-term tra-cheostomy and ventilation， we were unable to assess her re-sponse to plasma exchange.\n\n【49】Conclusions\n\n【50】Late-onset myasthenia gravis can mimic psychiatric panic dis eases and anaphylactic reactions because of the bulbar presen-tation. Misdiagnosis due to lack of recognition of appropriate symptoms is common. Myasthenia gravis should be ascertained with a low threshold as a differential diagnosis of acute-onset dysphagia，dysphonia， and/or dysarthria in middle-aged to el-derly people. Recognition of these symptoms should prompt early work-up of autoimmune etiology and initiation of ther-apy to prevent severe complications of myasthenic crises and acute respiratory failure.\n\n【51】References：\n\n【52】1\\.

This paper aims to critically appraise educational intervention in paedi-atrics rotation of general practice speciality training from the perspective of published theories， models and application of evaluation. The full training programme for general practice currently lasts a minimum of three years from ST1 to ST 3. Train-ing includes 18 months of hospital specialities rotation including obstetrics and gynaecology，paediatrics， geriatric medicine， acci-dent and emergency or psychiatry. Additional 18 months spent in GP surgery in General Practice. Educational evaluation is the measurement of progress towards meeting educational ob-jective \\[1\\]， and this is to provide significant information and data on how effective educational program is and furthermore to make recommendations to maximise outcomes to improve patient care\\[2\\]. “The care provided by UK children's health services is inferior in many regards to that in comparable Eu-ropean countries. Although there are many examples of good practice， health services too often provide poor outcomes and are seemingly planned around the needs of organisations rather than those of children， young people， and families.\"\\[3\\]. General Practitioners and Paediatricians sit at the heart of health care for babies， children and young people. Currently， the need for\n\n【12】fruitful collaboration is at its highest call hence conventional boundaries between these professionals must be broken down and build a bridge to provide a high-quality health service for the child and their family with the right doctor who has the nec-essary expertise. Poor health outcomes for children in the UK， the demand for service redesign， and the imperatives for change in training demand multi-professional and interdisciplinary col-laboration \\[4\\]. “Despite the high number of children coming into their surgeries， many GPs have little or no experience of paediatrics as part of their professional training. This means that， technical competence notwithstanding， many GPs lack the confidence to assess and treat children effectively， something that comes from specialist training and experience.\"\\[5\\]. Gen-eral Practitioners currently have a three-year model of training. RCPCH data \\[6I posits that only 50-60% of GPs， in many parts of the country， have had any formal paediatric & child health training outside their general practice posts. The training and exposure that trainees get during general practice training posts can be remarkable if their GP trainer is highly confident in man-aging children， but equally， it can be less so if the trainer had no dedicated paediatric training or limited interest in paediatrics or child health. A training model called Learning Together has been shown to make a difference with regards to learning out-comes for both specialities including clinical knowledge and skills， and professional outcomes of ongoing collaboration and attitudes. In an early audit of four common conditions across 22GP practices and 9 trusts in London where Learning Together clinics took place， good practice moved from 57% before the clin-ics to 72% during (p-value<0.01) and increased to 76% after the clinics， (p-value < 0.01 compared to before). Learning together clinics can be a positive lever for change \\[7\\]. Due to inadequate exposure of general practice trainees to general and community paediatrics， there is changing demography， the possibility of same changes occurring in the community-based training envi-ronment of general practice registrars is unknown. Currently， as a core requirement of Australian vocational training， general practice registrars are required to complete a paediatric hospital rotation or an emergency department rotation with a signifi-cant paediatric caseload. Furthermore， Australian GP trainee is expected to encounter numerous paediatric patients in the community-based setting during their clinical placements in primary care practices \\[8\\]. Formative Evaluation of Paediatric Rotation in General Practice Specialty Training The e-portfolio is used in paediatric rotation of the general practice specialty train to collect and collate evidence of learning， performance and progress in a systematic fashion. It can also be described as a for-mative assessment tool for gathering of assessment and record of attainment in line with curriculum of competence expected to be attained under the keen supervision of clinical supervisor(Consultant Paediatrician) and General practitioner (educational supervisor). It is designed to facilitate feedbacks and reflec-tions. It's not an examination tool but very significant part of final summative assessment to qualify as GP. For paediatric ro-tation， it consists of a minimum of three case-based discussion(CBD)， three mini clinical examinations (MiniCEX) and directly observed procedure (DOPS) with other log entries of reflections. There is no organised or systematic supervision by the clinical supervision， the majority of trainee used their initiative， but most times educational supervisors can play an advisory role. Theories Supporting Educational Program Evaluation Models Program evaluation is an essential part of medical education， relevant theories are important in understanding evaluation\n\n【13】models which most times focus on the change. Reductionism Theory of reductionism asserts that a program or an outcome can be totally understood and thus predicted by investigating and understanding its constituent parts \\[9\\]. This cause-effect di-mension needs an assumption of linearity， advocating that once the contributing factors of an outcome are known by program success or failure in achieving those outcomes can be explained\\[10\\]. One of the constituent’s parts of GP training scheme is Paediatrics and child health， but most current trainees had no paediatric posting their training rotation hence the outcome can be predicted， their confidence will be impaired when dealing with paediatric cases in general practice.\n\n【14】System Theory\n\n【15】This theory asserts that that program outcome is not just ex-plained just by its constituent part but by relationship between and among those parts and their environment. Furthermore， this theory showed that change is an inherent part of the system and their relationship with other parts will produce dynamic and ac-tive change \\[10\\]. The relationship between general practice and paediatrics is so intertwined that thy co-exist in huge dimension and this relationship produce significant changes positively or negatively depending on the investment of paediatric exposure on GP training speciality.\n\n【16】Complexity Theory\n\n【17】This is a constellation of diverse theories，have been used com-monly in medical education. The used of this theory provides practitioners with an in-depth understanding of interconnec-tivity， synergy and networking in evaluation \\[11\\]， illustrated in figure 1， General practice and paediatric training and health care delivery are hugely interconnected despite occasional com-plexity this can be managed with an appropriate action plan， protocol and guideline some already in place.\n\n【18】Fig. 1 Complexity Theory (Source： Cohen et al.，2007).\n\n| MODEL  | THEORY  | CONSIDERATIONS  | ADVANTAGES  | VALUE  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CIPP model  | Social systemtheory andcomplexitytheory.  | Does not assume lineate causality. Accounts for the complexity of medical. educational programmes. More complex data analysis.  | Focus on programme improvement. Pays attention to multiplesources of inputs.  | It is used in the process of evaluating， planning， implementation (formative)，and outcomes (summative， retrospective). Provides valuable information on why outcomeswere observed. Best to inform on the cost-effectiveness of selected approaches.  |\n| Experimental andQuasi-ExperimentalModels  | Reductionisttheory.  | Ethical considerations. Expensive (experimental). Assumes linear causality. Does not account for complex environment interactions in results.  | Familiar designin a medical environment.  | Provides evidence on reasons outcomes Were observed or not. Appropriate when high internal validity is more important. Useful when comparing pre-and post-intervention results.  |\n| Kirkpatrick's model  | Reductionisttheory.  | Assumes linear causality. Does not account for variables that affect learning.  | A clear focuson outcomes.  | Can be used with other models to define specifically the outcomes of the programme.  |\n\n【20】The purpose of an experimental model is to outline any out-come brought about by an intervention. Two groups are eval-uated， one in which the change has been implemented and a control group for comparative reasons. Experiments and quasi-experiments are methods of research which stem from a natural experiment approach， focusing on naturally occur-ring circumstances and targeting specific interventions \\[12\\]. Quasi-experiments differ from experimental models in that ran-domisation is eliminated in Quasi-experiments \\[13\\]. Quasi-experimental models of evaluation test a descriptive causalhy-pothesis about manipulatable causes \\[14\\] with non-randomised assigned control groups. Experimental designs equally make ob-servations about intervention but are randomly allocated. They provide the most information about possible cause-and-effect re-lationships \\[15\\]. Suchman in 1967 \\[16\\] has led the development of principles for evaluation research differentiating between eval-uation considered as a judgement and evaluation research based on scientific grounds. Contemporary approaches are based on\n\n【21】Shadish's work \\[14\\] which deals with the generalisation of causal connections \\[14\\]， \\[17\\]. This model is essential in evaluating the effectiveness of pre and post intervention of educational and training programs in General Practice as it relates to Paediatric training， how far has this positive impact of the new set of Gen-eral practitioners in dealing with paediatric cases confidently in communities.\n\n【22】Kirkpatrick model\n\n【23】Kirkpatrick's model of evaluation is a common model for eval-uating learner's outcomes in training programs (Kirkpatrick's) like general practice and paediatric training speciality. It consists of four levels of the hierarchy of program outcome as illustrated in figure 2； the first level deals with learner's satisfaction by evaluating their reaction to the program， the second level as-sesses the impact of training on learner's behaviour in terms of knowledge， skills and attitude， the e-portfolio can provide some insight into this. The third level how much information learners can apply to their workplace and practice. Finally， the\n\n【24】fourth level assesses the impact of this new learning at the pa-tient or community level \\[10\\]. However， the drawback here is that this evaluation model does consider the interaction between different elements of the program hence the interaction between Paediatrics and general practice should be mutual，synergistic， communal and interdependent in training， practice and health-care delivery in the community for huge impact and undeniable positive outcomes.\n\n【25】THE KIRKPATRICK MODEL\n\n【26】Fig. 2 The Kirkpatrick Model (Adapted from Petrone， 2017.\n\n【27】Context/Input/Process/Product model (CIPP Model)\n\n【28】This model was first described by Daniel Stufflebeam in 1971\\[19\\] made up of four set if evaluation component including con-text (baseline for evaluating later outcomes)， Input (Cost-effectiveness of alternative or competing approaches to edu-cational need)， Process (assess implementation of a program) and product (assesses program outcome， positive or negative). Furthermore， CIPP embraces complexity theory， the diversity of programmes and the non-linear relationships and changes occurring therein， deeming it useful in evaluation \\[10\\]. This model systematically investigates the value of a programme by obtaining ongoing data and reports on critical information at each step of programme implementation. It informs stakehold-ers on the quality， worth， feasibility， cost-effectiveness， impact and safety of the programme outcomes， therefore aligning to Programme Evaluation Standards in terms of utility， feasibility， accuracy and accountability \\[22\\]. Training， teaching and practice in Paediatrics and General practice are hugely capital intensive； hence any cut back from the specialities will negatively impact on training and healthcare delivery in the long run. Meticu-lous assessment between stakeholders in Government， training and teaching is inevitable before any financial and non-financial adjustment.\n\n【29】Discussion\n\n【30】Underpinning theories form the basis for evaluation models(Table 1). Reductionism understands systems by breaking it down into smaller components and assessing the impact of these components. In contrast， system theory， states that to understand a system， components should not be investigated individually， but at the relationships and interactions between components， within the system's environment. Also， complexity\n\n【31】Fig. 3 Key Components of the CIPP Evaluation Model and Associated Relationships with Programmes (Source： Stufflebeam& Shinkfield，2007)\n\n【32】theory assesses several areas in a system， to understand its inter-connectedness and networking. Based on the Kirkpatrick model， paediatric rotation learning in general practice training can be monitored with the use of e-portfolio and formative assessment of it can be done which will ultimately translate to summative assessment in the award of MRCGP diploma. CIPPP model(Figure3) is a proven way to assess the outcome of training and learning as per paediatric rotation in a GP practice. Trainees at three of Irelands 14 specialist GP training schemes were sur-veved 82 different clinical skills and presentations common in practice of Paediatrics in General Practice setting with forty-five percent (58/128) response scored on Likert scale， hospital-based trainees rate their competence in Paediatrics as 3.67/5and practice-based trainees scoring their competence as 4.13/5， furthermore trainees were asked to comment on their confidence performing selected paediatric skills and treatment of some com-mon paediatric cases， low level of confidence was reported in assessment of mental and physical development skills， vision and hearing assessment， management of food intolerance， sleep problems， non-accidental injury among many others \\[20. These findings are consistent with findings of GP training programs internationally， training in Paediatrics' for GPs varies between European countries but is generally considered to be too short\\[21\\]. General practice trainees may need more opportunities for exposure to paediatrics especially in those areas with perceived low confidence in skills and practice； this could be done even in General Practice under supervision of experience General practi-tioners with a paediatric interest in association with community paediatricians.\n\n【33】Conclusion\n\n【34】An evaluation of the complex and ever-changing world of medi-cal， educational programmes like paediatric rotation in GP train-ing is explored. Different evaluation models are reported in association with various underpinning theories and an analy-sis of how educational programmes and possible collaboration\n\n【35】Taiwo Akhigbe et al./ International Journal of Medical Reviews and Case Reports (ARTICLE IN PRESS)\n\n【36】between the two specialities can relate.

This rare disease affects one in 100 000 to one in 160 000， the wide variation reflects paucity of population-based data\\[1\\]. Both sporadic and familial cases with autosomal dominant inheritance have been reported.\n\n【22】CASE REPORT\n\n【23】The patient is a 9-year-old boy who presented with a3-month history of intermittent periumbilical ab-dominal pain. He had episodes of pain lasting several hours；3-4 times per week. There was also history of in-termittent fresh rectal bleeding associated with mucus passing for about two months. There was no history of associated diarrhea， nausea or vomiting. He also had history of generalized edema since one week before admission. At the time of assessment， he appeared pale and had generalized pitting edema. Chest and cardiac examination were normal. Initial investigations included a complete blood count that showed： Hb of5.4g/dL， WBC 11×10°/L， platelet 480x10\"/L； total protein of 3.8 g/dL， serum albumin of 2.3 g/dL (normal range， 3.3-5.5 g/dL) and normal transaminase levels. Renal assessment was normal. Total colonoscopy was performed， which revealed numerous polypoid lesions with varying sizes and shapes (pedunculated and sessile) (Figure 1). Some polyps were extracted and sent for pathology. Histopathologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of JPS (Figure 2)\n\n【24】Figure 1. Colonoscopic view of juvenile polyporsis.\n\n【25】JPS is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition， a hamartomatous disorder， which was first described in 1964 \\[2\\]. The diagnosis of JPS is made when the following clinical criteria are met \\[3\\]：\n\n【26】· there are more than five juvenile polyps of the co-lon or rectum，or\n\n【27】· there are juvenile polyps in other parts of the gas-trointestinal tract， or\n\n【28】• presence of any number of juvenile polyps and a positive family history for JPS.\n\n【29】Sachatello et al further categorized Juvenile Polyposis\n\n【30】aCC\n\n【31】patients into three phenotypic groups according to clinical presentation and disease course \\[4\\]：(1) Juvenile Polyposis of infancy；(2) Juvenile Polyposis Coli (colonic involvement only)； and (3) Generalized Juvenile Polyposis. Both Generalized Juvenile Polyposis and Juvenile Polyposis of the Colon may present with acute or chronic gastrointestinal bleed-ing， anemia， prolapsed rectal polyps， abdominal pain and diarrhea \\[5\\]. In contrast to Familial Adenomatous Polyposis， JPS is always symptomatic in children\\[6\\]. Symptoms of JPS include rectal bleeding， rectal prolapse， crampy abdominal pain， and intussuscep-tion. Most cases of JPS come to medical attention between 2 and 12 years of age \\[6\\]， although rare cases of failure to thrive， anemia， and severe hypo-albuminemia resulting from protein-losing enteropathy have been described in infancy \\[6，7\\]. Our case that presented with anemia and hypoproteinemic edema is older than previously reported cases. Polyps vary in number from 3 to 200 and show great variation in size and configuration and distribution throughout the colon， although some patients may have polyps\n\n【32】in stomach and small intestine \\[6\\]. The polyps range from a few millimeters to a few centimeters in size. In most cases， polyps are found only in the colon \\[8\\]. There is an association with congenital birth defects in 15% of cases， including malrotation of the midgut， genitourinary and cardiac defects \\[5\\]. The majority of congenital defects have been reported in individuals with the nonfamilial variant of the disease. Our patient had not any congenital anomalies. Macroscopically， a juvenile polyp has a smooth， spherical red head on a narrow stalk. The intervening mucosa between polyps is normal in contrast to Familial Adenomatous Polyposis. Microscopic changes are mucin-filled cystic dilatation of the epithelial tubules embedded in abundant lamina propria. The tubules are lined by normal columnar epithelium. The cellular infiltrate of the lamina propria includes myofibroblasts， fibroblasts， and macrophages. These findings are seen in our case.

Drug-induced pulmonary fibrosis is associated with pulmonary hypoplasia. A case of acquired platy-thorax is presented in a young man previously treated with cyclophosphamide in childhood.\n\n【21】Case Report：\n\n【22】A 20-year-old man began to experience cough， chest pain， and mild exertional dyspnea. He was admitted to the hospital at 23 years of age with respiratory failure. Chest imaging showed pleural thickening and platythorax. He had been successfully treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)， at 3 years of age， with chemothera-py that included a cumulative dose of cyclophosphamide of 15.6 g/m. His ALL relapsed six years later and he was the treated again with cyclophosphamide and underwent a second and complete remission. A clinical di-agnosis of late-onset cyclophosphamide-induced lung disease with progressive platythorax was made on the basis of his clinical history and on imaging findings of the ratio of the AP to lateral chest wall diameter when compared with age-matched controls. Despite continued remission of his ALL， he died of progressive cardio-pulmonary failure at 25 years of age.\n\n【23】Conclusions：\n\n【24】This report described a rare case of acquired platythorax， or flattening of the chest， in a young adult. The use of the ratio of the chest wall AP diameter to lateral diameter may be used in the early detection of this rare chemotherapy-induced complication in children and adults.\n\n【25】MeSH Keywords： Cyclophosphamide · Pulmonary Fibrosis·Thoracic Diseases\n\n【26】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/911701\n\n【27】目名111677 1 山2斗 轴 1 8\n\n【28】Chest wall deformities can be congenital or acquired. The most common chest wall deformity is congenital pectus ex-cavatum， which occurs in 88% of cases \\[1\\]. Platythorax， or flattening of the chest with a reduction in the anteroposterior(AP) diameter， is very rare \\[2\\]. Platythorax can be primary or secondary to diseases of the bone of the chest wall， including pectus excavatum \\[2\\] and scoliosis \\[3\\] or to pulmonary disease associated with pulmonary fibrosis or pulmonary hypoplasia including congenital diaphragmatic hernia， chronic broncho-pulmonary dysplasia \\[4\\]， pulmonary infection， autoimmune disease， drug-induced pulmonary fibrosis \\[5\\]， and idiopathic pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis \\[6\\].\n\n【29】Platythorax is very rare， and the prognosis is varied， depending on the degree of the deformity， its effects on respiratory function， and on any underlying disease. Because the condi-tion is rare， the mechanism of its development， pathogenesis， and prognosis remain unknown.\n\n【30】This report is of a young man who developed platythorax due to cyclophosphamide-related pulmonary fibrosis eight years after the cessation of chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This report also describes the method used de-termine the ratio of the chest wall AP diameter to lateral di-ameter to show the timeline of progression in the flattening of the chest wall in this patient， compared with twenty long-term survivors of childhood ALL The pathogenesis of platy-thorax due to drug-induced pulmonary fibrosis is discussed with a review of the literature on cyclophosphamide-associ-ated pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n【31】Case Report\n\n【32】A 20-year-old man began to experience cough， chest pain， and mild exertional dyspnea. He was admitted to the hospital at 23 years of age with respiratory failure. He had been suc-cessfully treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at 3years of age， with chemotherapy that included a cumulative dose of cyclophosphamide of 15.6 g/m. His ALL relapsed six years later， when he was 9-years-old， and he was the treated again with cyclophosphamide and underwent a second and complete remission. During chemotherapy for ALL， he did not experience pulmonary adverse events， including pneumonia， and chest X-ray at the time of cessation of chemotherapy at11 years of age was normal (Figure 1A). He was never treated with radiotherapy. Unfortunately， he was lost to follow-up for several years， until he presented to our hospital at the age of20 years， due to a one-week history of non-productive cough.\n\n【33】On this most recent hospital admission， at the age of 23 years， he was in respiratory failure， and chest imaging showed pleural thickening and platythorax， or flattening of the chest with a reduction in the anteroposterior (AP) diameter， was prominent(Figure 1B). His respiratory rate was 52/min with 75% SpO，. No respiratory infections were identified. Chest computed to-mography (CT) showed diffuse infiltrates and bilateral pleural thickening (Figure 1C). His pulmonary vital capacity was 0.56 L(13.3%) of the predicted value. No physical findings， blood tests， or family history suggested the presence of collagen or auto-immune diseases. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation(PPV) with oxygen was commenced for respiratory failure. He developed severe dyspnea with New York Heart Association(NYHA) class IV heart failure， secondary to pulmonary fibrosis， which gradually worsened.\n\n【34】At 25 years of age， he died of cardiopulmonary failure， five years after the onset of respiratory symptoms. Permission for an autopsy was not obtained. It was assumed that his platy-thorax， or reduced AP diameter of the chest， might have been secondary to pulmonary hypoplasia with pulmonary fibrosis because the diaphragm in his chest X-ray films had been ele-vated. He had previously received a moderate dose of cyclo-phosphamide (cumulative dose， 15.6 g/m2) for the treatment of ALL. Finally， based on the clinical course and exclusion of other diseases， a clinical diagnosis was made of cyclophospha-mide-related late-onset pulmonary fibrosis resulting in platy-thorax， or reduced AP diameter of the chest.\n\n【35】Discussion\n\n【36】Platythorax， or flattening of the chest with a reduction in the anteroposterior (AP) diameter， is rare and the mechanisms in-volved in the development of this condition remain unknown. Drug-induced pulmonary fibrosis is one of the pulmonary hypo-plasia-related disorders associated with acquired platythorax. However， pulmonary fibrosis has many causes， including sclero-derma (systemic sclerosis)， sarcoidosis， infection， and exposure to drugs， toxins， or radiation， and the most common and most fatal type of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia is idiopathic pul-monary fibrosis (IPF). Cyclophosphamide pulmonary toxicity is a rare cause of pulmonary fibrosis and is usually a diagnosis of exclusion， as blood examinations， bronchoalveolar lavage(BAL)， or lung biopsy may not be diagnostic \\[7\\].\n\n【37】There have been 15 reported cases， including six children and nine adults， of late-onset pulmonary disease associated with cy-clophosphamide therapy， including this case (Table 1) \\[5，7-13\\]. In many of these cases， late-onset pulmonary toxicity devel-oped in patients who had received prolonged treatment over several months to years with relatively low doses of cyclophos-phamide， and the prognosis was poor \\[5，7-13\\]. The interval\n\n【38】Figure 1.

(B) The anteroposterior (AP) and lateral view of the chest. (C) A chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed pleural thickening， and pulmonary fibrosis distributed in both subpleural regions， and around bronchovascular bundles.\n\n【39】from initiation of cyclophosphamide treatment to the onset of respiratory symptoms varied from 0.4-19 years (median， seven years)， and the cumulative dose of cyclophosphamide ranged from 3.4-91 g/m2 \\[5，7-13\\]. Initial symptoms were nonspecific， including a cough and exertional dyspnea. Pulmonary function tests showed a severe restrictive ventilation defect and chest X-ray showed pleural thickening in most of the cases \\[5，7-13\\]. The major pathologic feature was pulmonary fibrosis \\[5，7-13\\]. Severe chest deformity developed only in the cases that re-ceived chemotherapy in childhood (cases 1 and 4).\n\n【40】Therefore， severe platythorax due to cyclophosphamide-related pulmonary fibrosis may occur predominantly in children. The patient in the present report received a moderate dose of cy-clophosphamide intermittently (cumulative dose， 15.6 g/m?). Although the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis due to\n\n【41】cyclophosphamide is poorly understood， there may be genetic differences in local pulmonary drug metabolism that could be risk factors， but these remain to be identified. Among the cy-tochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily， CYP2B6 is a major enzyme that metabolizes cyclophosphamide and is expressed in lung tissues \\[14\\]. However， cyclophosphamide is also a substrate of other CYPs (including CYP2A6， CYP2C19，CYP2C9， and CYP3A4). Because platythorax， or flattening of the chest wall， with pul-monary fibrosis associated with cyclophosphamide treatment is very rare， it is possible to speculate that CYP polymorphism may have a role in the development of this condition.\n\n【42】Currently， there are few available treatments for pulmonary fibrosis and treatment is of limited efficacy. The profibrotic signaling inhibitors， pirfenidone and nintedanib， have been shown to slow the decline in lung function in patients with IPF，\n\n【43】Ito T.et al：\n\n【44】OAm J Case Rep， 2018；19： 1317-1323\n\n【45】Table 1.

However， the ability of pirfenidone and nint-edanib to resolve fibrosis in IPF has not been demonstrated. Reddy et al. reported that depletion of the transcription factor PPARyin lung fibroblasts induced a profibrotic phenotype， and that activation of PPARy promoted dedifferentiation in lung myofibroblasts in an animal model in vivo \\[17\\].\n\n【50】The underlying mechanism for the development of platythorax， or flattening of the chest with a reduction in the AP diameter， and the association with pulmonary fibrosis has not been\n\n【51】investigated. It is possible to hypothesize that pulmonary fi-brosis that occurs at an early age has an adverse effect on the development of the thorax. The development of the chest wall occurs at the same time as the development of the lungs， in-cluding alveolarization with the expansion of the lungs， which continues from childhood to young adulthood \\[18\\]. Therefore， chemotherapeutic damage to the lungs may result in interrup-tion of alveolar development and impaired pulmonary func-tion followed by chest deformity in some children. Recently， Beynat-Mouterde et al. reported that platythorax， or flattening of the chest， with pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis was a late\n\n【52】Figure 2.

Control sub-jects included a total of 100 children and young adults (age range， 0-24 years). These control subjects were admitted to the hospital for various surgical procedures and preoperative chest radiographs were taken. Subjects with congenital anom-alies and airway disorders were excluded from this study， and the remaining subjects were subdivided into five groups. Box plots analysis of the T (thickness)/W (width) ratio on chest ra-diographs were performed for 10 men and 10 women in each age group， which included 0-4 years， 5-9 years， 10-14 years，15-19 years， and 20-24 years. Platythorax was defined as T/W <0.60 (0.703+0.103， mean +2 SD)， 0.55 (0.638±0.086)，0.50 (0.631±0.127)，0.50 (0.614±0.115)， 0.51 (0.627±0.119)， respectively (Figure 2A). There was no sex variation among all\n\n【55】age groups (men， 0.654+0.128； women， 0.632±0.120， mean±2 SD). Among each age group， an inter-patient variation of T/W ratio was seen. Mild， moderate， and severe platythorax were tentatively defined as， - 3 SD ST/W<-2 SD，-4 SD ST/W<-3 SD， and T/W <- 4 SD， respectively.\n\n【56】In the ALL cohort， the T/W ratio in 21 long-term child survivors of ALL， with a median follow-up of eight years after cessation of chemotherapy (range， 2-12 years) was serially plotted. In this case report of a patient with platythorax， the T/W ratio gradually decreased from 0.61 (normal) to 0.43 (moderate)， and to 0.35 (severe platythorax) over ten years (Figure 2B). The remaining patients with ALL had normal chest radiographs.\n\n【57】Conclusions\n\n【58】This report described a rare case of acquired platythorax， or flattening of the chest wall， in a young adult. The use of the\n\n【59】ratio of the chest wall AP diameter to late ral diameter (the T/W ratio) may be used in the early detection of this chemotherapy-induced complication in children and adults. This case was also reported to draw attention to this rare but potentially lethal complication of cyclophosphamide treatment.\n\n【60】Acknowledgments\n\n【61】The authors thank Dr. A. A.

Management strategies have varied， but the mortality rate for mechanically ventilated pa-tients remains high. Conventional management with ARDSnet ventilation can improve outcomes but alterna-tive and adjunct treatments continue to be explored. High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV)， a modality now rarely used in adult critical care medicine， may offer an alternative treatment option by maximizing lung protection and limiting oxygen toxicity in critically ill patients failing conventional ventilator strategies.\n\n【26】Case Reports：\n\n【27】We present 3 patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis due to COVID-19who all improved clinically after transitioning from conventional ventilation to HFOV. Two patients developed refractory hypoxemia with hemodynamic instability and multiple organ failure requiring vasopressor support and renal replacement therapy. After failing to improve with all available therapies， both patients stabilized and ultimately improved after being placed on HFOV. The third patient developed severe volutrauma/barotrauma despite extreme lung protection and ARDSnet ventilation. He showed improvement in oxygenation and signs of lung trauma slowly improved after initiating HFOV. All 3 patients were ultimately liberated from mechanical ventilation and discharged from the hospital to return to functional independence.\n\n【28】Conclusions：\n\n【29】Our experience suggests that HFOV offers advantages in the management of certain critically ill patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 pneumonia and might be considered in cases refractory to standard management strategies.\n\n【30】Keywords： Adult Multisystem Inflammatory Disease， COVID-19 Related· Respiration， Artificial·Respiratory Distress Syndrome\n\n【31】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/936651\n\n【32】Two years into a global pandemic， COVID-19 continues to place a tremendous burden on the healthcare system， with criti-cal disease most commonly presenting as respiratory failure. While management of hypoxemic patients remains somewhat inconsistent and controversial， most guidelines recommend management according to well-established ARDSnet guide-lines \\[1\\]. The true pathophysiology of lung injury due to SARS-CoV-2 infection remains uncertain， but lung protection from oxygen toxicity and excessive tidal volumes remain important management strategies. Prone ventilation， combined with lung protective ventilation， has proven to be clinically efficacious for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) \\[2\\] and has be-come routine in COVID-19-associated lung injury \\[3\\]. Despite these measures， refractory lung failure leading to death remains common. Additional therapies and treatments such as inhaled pulmonary artery vasodilators，alternative modes of ventilation such as airway pressure release ventilation (APRV)， and extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) have been utilized throughout the pandemic. Similar to their use for ARDS pri-or to COVID， reported outcomes have been variable but large-ly disappointing， certainly none emerging as the panacea for management \\[4，5\\].\n\n【33】High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) offers theoreti-cal benefit in ARDS management by emphasizing extreme lung protection from excessive volume， but essentially fell out of clinical use after 2 trials in 2013 failed to show clinical bene-fit， with 1 suggesting increased mortality \\[6，7\\]. Like most treat-ments for ARDS， evidence prior to these trials was mixed， but the negative results of these trials， combined with encour-aging results from the CESAR trial investigating veno-venous ECMO \\[8\\]， essentially sealed the fate of HFOV and eliminated its role in the treatment of ARDS. The impact of COVID， how-ever， has forced the medical community to reconsider treat-ments from the past while searching for new treatments. With few consistently efficacious therapeutics， extreme lung pro-tection while buying time appears paramount to good out-comes. The impact of oxygen toxicity has come to the fore-front during this pandemic \\[9\\]， with fibrotic lung disease often developing much quicker than observed with other patho-gens. Despite mixed mortality outcomes， a large body of evi-dence with HFOV prior to COVID supports improved oxygen-ation with its use \\[10-12\\]. The benefit of lower delivered tidal volumes is unquestionable and low-tidal volume ventilation is currently the only therapeutic intervention independently as-sociated with improved survival for patients with ARDS \\[13\\]. With this in mind， HFOV offers a potentially useful ventilation strategy for severe ARDS due to COVID-19.\n\n【34】We present 3 cases of respiratory failure due to severe COVID-19pneumonia managed with HFOV in accordance with the CARE reporting check list. SARS-CoV-2 variants were not available to the treating team， but all 3 cases were encountered during the delta and omicron surges and were assumed to be due to one of these variants. All 3 patients were ventilated using the SensorMedics 3100B oscillator. Management of all 3 was di-rected by Intensivists with prior training and experience with HFOV prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was con-ducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (as re-vised in 2013). The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Lexington Medical Center. Written informed consent was obtained retrospectively from the patients for publication of this case series and accompanying images. A copy of the written consent is available for review by the ed-itorial office of this journal.\n\n【35】Case 1\n\n【36】A 21-year-old unvaccinated， morbidly obese woman (BMI 65) was admitted 6 days after diagnosis of COVID-19. She was hypoxemic in the emergency department (ED) and required emergent intubation. She remained severely hypoxemic de-spite 100% Fi02 and 22 of PEEP， so inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) was added. She was placed in prone position but continued to require 100% oxygen and high PEEP with elevated mean airway and plateau pressures in the 30s. She demonstrated evidence of sepsis， cytokine storm， and renal failure and was treated with all available therapies for COVID-19 (dexameth-asone， baricitinib； no Remdesivir due to renal failure and me-chanical ventilation). She remained gravely ill with no clinical improvement and required initiation of continuous renal re-placement therapy (CRRT) on day 3. For refractory ARDS， she was placed on HFOV. Settings were set to allow for weaning of oxygen， and to allow for extreme permissive hypercapnia. Her Fi02 was weaned below 60% within the first 24 hours of HFOV， and over the next 2 days her mean airway pressure(MAP) was weaned to maintain saturations of 90%. By day 3of HFOV she had weaned to acceptable settings and her re-spiratory acidosis improved. She was transitioned to conven-tional ventilation with a high PEEP strategy. Over the next 3days， her PEEP was weaned and neuromuscular blockade dis-continued. Given her body habitus， she underwent early tra-cheostomy on ventilator day 8. Ventilator settings were slowly weaned， she transitioned to tracheostomy collar continuously on hospital day 17， and transferred out of the intensive care unit (ICU) on day 18. She was weaned to room air on day 23. Her renal function recovered， no longer requiring renal replace-ment therapy， and she discharged home on day 32.\n\n【37】Case 2\n\n【38】A 53-year-old unvaccinated woman presented to the ED with cough， fever， and dyspnea for 1 week. A chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates and she was hypoxemic with positive PCR for COVID-19. She required intubation in the ED and was ad-mitted to the ICU. COVID-19 treatments were limited due to shock with renal failure but she was started on corticosteroids and baricitinib. Initial arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed severe hypoxemia and hypercapnia， and iNO was started. Prone venti-lation was attempted but she worsened clinically and required emergent supination. With refractory hypoxemia， hypercapnia， and hemodynamic instability on 100% FiO2 and 14 of PEEP， she was placed on HFOV on hospital day 2. She remained crit-ically ill and required vasopressor support along with CRRT for renal failure， acidosis， and volume control. Empiric antibiotics were started for possible superimposed bacterial pneumonia. Mean airway pressure was maintained and oxygen preferen-tially weaned， with settings again allowing for extreme permis-sive hypercapnia. Over the next several days， MAP was slowly\n\n【39】Figure 1.

She was managed with a high PEEP strat-egy， slowly weaned， and underwent tracheostomy on hospi-tal day 17. She was liberated from the ventilator and trans-ferred out of the ICU on hospital day 24. Her tracheostomy tube was removed on day 34 and she was discharged to re-hab on hospital day 44 on 2L nasal cannula， still requiring in-termittent hemodialysis but with improving urine output， en-couraging for eventual renal recovery.\n\n【41】Case 3\n\n【42】A 38-year-old unvaccinated man presented to the ED with pro-gressive dyspnea， cough， and fevers 5 days after being diag-nosed with COVID-19. A chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates and he was hypoxemic， requiring heated high-flow nasal can-nula (HHFNC). He was admitted to the hospital ward and start-ed on dexamethasone，Remdesivir， and baricitinib. He gradual-ly worsened and required transfer to the ICU on hospital day5. He was intubated on arrival， placed in prone position， and\n\n【43】started on iNO. He initially improved and was returned supine. On day 3 of intubation he became more hypoxemic and a chest X-ray revealed subcutaneous emphysema with pneumomedi-astinum (Figure 1A). Fenestrated subcutaneous catheters were placed but he continued to worsen with worsening hypoxemia， hypercapnia， and worsening subcutaneous emphysema/pneu-momediastinum (Figure 1B). He was placed on HFOV， again allowing for permissive hypercapnia and in this case aggres-sively weaning MAP to avoid further barotrauma. He transi-tioned off HFOV to conventional ventilation on day 6 of HFOV with a chest X-ray showing improvement of pneumomedias-tinum and subcutaneous emphysema (Figure 1C). A low tidal volume， a low PEEP strategy was implemented， continuing to allow for hypercapnia. His neuromuscular blocker was discon-tinued， sedation was weaned， and he was extubated on venti-lator day 12. He transferred out of the ICU on hospital day 19， weaned off oxygen， and discharged home on hospital day 28.\n\n【44】Discussion\n\n【45】The management of ARDS changed drastically with the results of the landmark ARMA trial published in 2000，which demon-strated a nearly 9% decrease in mortality utilizing a low-tidal volume strategy \\[13\\]. The standard of care became universal seemingly overnight. Prone ventilation， when combined with low tidal volume ventilation has since been demonstrated to further improve survival \\[2\\]. Nevertheless， the mortality rate remains unacceptably high， approaching 50% in some popu-lations \\[14\\]. The search for other efficacious ventilation strat-egies and management has remained largely disappointing， with numerous medications and ventilator modalities proving to be largely ineffective. W ECMO offers promising treatment， in part by limiting tidal volumes to an extreme， but is highly invasive， labor intensive， heavily consumes resources， and is often available only at tertiary medical centers. Furthermore， outcomes for COVID-19 have been inconsistent\\[51.\n\n【46】Here we present 3 patients， all previously healthy， who rap-idly worsened from COVID-19 despite all available medical therapies for COVID-19 and evidence-based ventilator man-agement. While evidence is lacking， inhaled nitric oxide was added in all 3 in an effort to improve oxygenation and limit injurious ventilator settings. With refractory hypoxemia and the availability of HFOV at our institution， our team placed each patient on HFOV.\n\n【47】The theoretical advantages of HFOV center around improving oxygenation through increased mean airway pressure while pro-tecting the lungs from the high distending alveolar pressures and tidal volumes associated with increased mortality. The val-ue of low-tidal volume ventilation was established in 2000 as the undeniable standard of care. Results have been confirmed\n\n【48】in many trials that have followed， and further analysis from the same trial showed that within the low tidal volume group，pa-tients with lower plateau pressures had longer survival than those with higher plateaus \\[13\\]. Management with HFOV al-lows for extreme lung protection by ventilating using tidal vol-umes smaller than anatomic dead space， thus maximizing the only know independent lung-protective ventilation intervention.\n\n【49】With this strategy often comes the concept of permissive hy-percapnia. The safety of this strategy has long been established， trading “normal\" ABG results for the benefit of lung-protective tidal volumes. This may be of additional importance in the case of air-leak syndromes， such as patient 3， where targeted tidal volumes may be even lower than traditional goals. Excessive barotrauma has been reported with COVID-19 and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality \\[15\\]. HFOV allows for high MAP， with much of the pressures dissipating prior to reaching the distant alveoli， thus allowing for less damage and potential-ly quicker healing. While safe Co， and pH values are somewhat arbitrary， we allowed for extreme values， which we determined to be safe based on favorable hemodynamics in our patients\n\n【50】Despite discouraging survival outcomes in the 2 most recent randomized trials on HFOV， most prior evidence does support improved oxygenation using HFOV， particularly when combined with inhaled nitric oxide \\[10-12，16\\]. While difficult to quanti-fy， the potential of oxygen toxicity has come to the forefront during the pandemic， with a seemingly abnormal proportion of patients developing irreversible lung damage and fibrosis despite lack of progression to multiple organ failure， which is most often cited at the cause of death from traditional ARDS. With HFOV， our management strategy was to quickly lower FiO2as low as possible while maintaining mean airway pressures to safely and effectively oxygenate and ventilate. Each of our patients was able to wean quickly， within the first 24 hours of transitioning to HFOV， limiting exposure to high-dose oxygen.\n\n【51】Conclusions\n\n【52】While HFOV has fallen out of favor and should not be routinely utilized in management， we believe it should be considered in select cases when hypoxemia persists and/or standard goals cannot be accomplished. As with any therapy or intervention， it is less likely to be efficacious when used as a rescue thera-py and if used， should only be used by experienced clinicians， relatively early in the clinical course of illness.\n\n【53】Declaration of Figures' Authenticity\n\n【54】All figures submitted have been created by the authors who confirm that the images are original with no duplication and have not been previously published in whole or in part.\n\n【55】1\\.

The overall metastatic rate of MU is approximately 27.5%. However， the prognosis of MU specific to pressure sores is poor， with a reported metastatic rate of 61%. This is due to insidious， asymptomatic malignant degeneration， a lack of healthcare provider awareness， and， ultimately， delayed management.\n\n【24】Case Report： An 85-year-old white male was noted by his wound-care nurse to have a rapidly developing growth on his low-er back over a period of 4 months.\n\n【25】There was history of a non-healing， progressive pressure ulcer of the lower back for the past 10 years.

In the literature， this has been said to occur in 1.7% of chronic wounds \\[1\\]. The setting is typ-ically osteomyelitis and burn scars. MUs are most common-ly squamous cell carcinoma； however， the incidence of squa-mous cell carcinoma in pressure sores has been reported to be as low as 0.5%\\[2\\].\n\n【35】We present a rare case of squamous cell carcinoma diag nosed in a patient with a long-standing pressure ulcer. This report demonstrates the rare， but important， association be-tween chronic wounds and malignancy. Also demonstrated is the sequence of diagnostic steps necessary to reach a swift diagnosis. It is essential that wound-care providers are aware of the clinical signs and symptoms of malignant degeneration in chronic wounds.\n\n【36】Case Report\n\n【37】An 85-year-old white male was noted by his wound-care nurse to have a rapidly developing growth on his lower back over a period of 4 months.\n\n【38】There was history of a non-healing， progressive pressure ul-cer of the lower back for the previous 10 years. He sustained a spinal cord injury at the age of 51， and was completely par-alyzed in the lower extremities. There were no known medi-cal conditions. The patient was born in Italy， but had resided in Venezuela for the past 20 years. There were no known sick contacts， pets in the household， or insect bites. The patient did not smoke， drink alcohol， or use illicit drugs. He consis-tently followed a healthy diet and lifted weights daily. There was a strong family history of skin cancer， and he was not tak-ing any medications.\n\n【39】On examination， the patient was afebrile and normotensive. There was a 3.5x4 cm pressure ulcer of the lower back， with a superimposed 1.5x2 cm growth in the upper aspect (Figure1). There was an absence of palpable regional lymphadenopathy. Laboratory workup did not reveal leukocytosis and electrolytes were within normal limits. A complete blood count with differ-ential revealed normal values. Additionally， the patient had a good nutritional status.\n\n【40】Under suspicion of malignancy， 2 punch biopsies of the wound edge and wound bed were taken. Histopathological examina-tion revealed non-infiltrating， well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma consistent with MU. There were nests of hyper-chromatic squamous epithelial cells arising from the epider-mis， without extension into the dermis. The ulcer was excised\n\n【41】Figure 1. Marjolin's ulcer： A 3.5x4 cm ulcer of the lower back with a superimposed 1.5x2 cm growth in the supe-rior region.\n\n【42】with 2-cm margins and a split-thickness skin graft was placed. Metastasis was not evident on imaging； therefore， chemora-diation therapy was deemed to be unnecessary.\n\n【43】Most recently， the patient’s wound has healed well and there are no signs of recurrence at 1-year follow-up.\n\n【44】Discussion\n\n【45】Malignant degeneration in any chronic wound is termed an MU \\[3\\]. This was first described in 1828 by Jean-Nicholas Marjolin as a malignant transformation of chronic healing， re-sulting from burn injuries \\[4\\].\n\n【46】In the literature， malignant degeneration has been reported to occur in 1.7% of chronic wounds \\[1\\]. Examples include burn scars， chronic draining sinuses due to osteomyelitis， and pres-sure ulcers； burns being the most common. MU may develop in various anatomical locations， including the lower extrem-ity (53.3%)， upper extremity (18.7%)， and trunk (12.4%)\\[5\\]. The predilection of these lesions may be due to injuries that affect the arms and legs (trauma， burns， venous stasis ulcers， and osteomyelitis) \\[5\\]. The latency period for malignant trans-formation can be accelerated or take decades \\[2\\].\n\n【47】The incidence of squamous cell carcinoma specific to pressure sores has been described in the literature \\[2，6-12\\]. However， this is rare， and the incidence has been said to be as low as0.5%\\[2\\]. One case described the development of MU 2.5 years\n\n【48】Table 1. Clinical indications of malignant degeneration.\n\n【49】after surgical excision and successful closure of a sacral pres-sure sore \\[8\\]. Cases similar to our patient， involving paraplegic and tetraplegic individuals， have also been described \\[2，10，11\\]. Ellitsgaard et al. recommended admittance of paraplegic and tetraplegic patients with pressure sores to a spinal cord in-jury center \\[11\\].\n\n【50】MUs are most commonly squamous cell carcinoma (75-95%)， with other possibilities being basal cell carcinoma， melano-ma， and sarcoma \\[13\\]. The 2 major morphologic forms are the well-differentiated exophytic form， which generally have a bet-ter prognosis， and the poorly-differentiated ulcerative form， which have a poor prognosis due to frequent infiltration. The overall metastatic rate of MU is approximately 27.5%\\[5\\].The metastatic rate in those arising in pressure ulcers has been reported to be as high as 61%， a rate much higher than that resulting from burn scars (38%) and osteomyelitis (14%)\\[5\\].\n\n【51】At 3 years post-diagnosis， the overall survival for patients with Marjolin's ulcer is 65-75%， but decreases to 35-50% if there is metastatic disease on presentation \\[5\\]. Additionally， palpable regional lymphadenopathy predicts death within 2years \\[3\\]. MU specific to pressure ulcers， however， have been reported to have a 2-year mortality rate as high as 80% in pa-tients with local disease who solely underwent excision \\[6\\]. Another author reported a 66% 2-year mortality rate from lo-cal or metastatic disease \\[6\\].\n\n【52】Numerous interesting theories have been described in the lit-erature as to the pathophysiology behind MU. An increased rate of spontaneous mutations due to prolonged inflammation and repetitive healing attempts has been proposed \\[2\\]. It has also been hypothesized that in epithelium of chronic ulcers， there may be a deficiency of innate immunological cells (nat-ural killer cells) that normally counter malignancy. Abnormal\n\n【53】cells can then evade immunosurveillance， increasing the risk of metastasis \\[2\\].\n\n【54】One study concluded that chronic ulcers present for decades that then undergo malignant degeneration is a disease of de-veloping countries， where patients only present to the physi-cian after complications have developed \\[14\\]. Our patient ex-hibited signs of malignant degeneration via the formation of a superimposed mass that was promptly recognized by his wound-care nurse. The ulcer was in a location unnoticeable by the patient， and with a history of paraplegia he did not ex-perience pain. Of note， the absence of pain may also be seen in chronic MUs without paraplegia. Therefore， heavy reliance was placed on his wound-care provider.\n\n【55】Indications of malignant degeneration include chronic ulcer-ation longer than 3 months， the appearance of a mass， rolled or everted wound margins， excessive granulation tissue， foul-smelling discharge， onset of pain， and change in the character-istics of discharge \\[2，15，16\\]. A list of these indications can be seen in Table 1. In the presence of any of these indications， a biopsy should be obtained. A punch biopsy of the wound ed ge and wound bed were obtained in the present case. Some au-thors recommend annual biopsies of these ulcers \\[15\\]. Another technique includes radical excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy if the patient does not have palpable lymph nodes \\[2\\].\n\n【56】The standard treatment for MU is local excision with wide mar-gins； however， there is no clear consensus for resection mar-gins. Upon reviewing the literature， we did not find any ran-domized controlled trials assessing resection margins for MU. In the literature， 2-4 cm resection margins are suggested \\[17\\]. One author found a very low recurrence rate when 3-5 cm margins were used \\[18\\]. In clinically node-negative patients， sentinel lymph node biopsy can be useful to assess the fur-ther need for chemo-radiation therapy \\[2\\]. Additionally， adju-vant chemo-radiation therapy can be used in cases of wide-spread metastasis. Variable results have been obtained with adjuvant chemotherapy for pressure ulcer carcinomas， and ra-diotherapy has been used in palliation to treat patients with unresectable disease \\[6\\].\n\n【57】The prognosis of MU specific to pressure sores is poor， with a reported metastatic risk of 61%， as stated previously \\[5\\]. This is due to insidious， asymptomatic， malignant degeneration， a lack of healthcare provider awareness， and delayed management.\n\n【58】Conclusions\n\n【59】This report demonstrates the important association between chronic inflammation and malignancy. Marjolin’s ulcer has a rapid progression from local disease to widespread metastasis.\n\n【60】Therefore， it is essential that wound-care providers are aware of the signs and symptoms of malignant degeneration in chronic wounds. Tissue biopsy， in addition to recognizing the signs of malignant degeneration， is essential for the diagnosis of cutane-ous malignancy. This is necessary to reach a swift diagnosis and avoid delayed management before deadly metastasis occurs.\n\n【61】References：\n\n【62】1\\. Trent JT， Kirsner RS： Wounds and malignancy.

The incidence ofrupture of patellar tendon following TKP has been reported in the literature as 0.17% \\[1\\]. No detailed informa-tion exists on patellar tendon ruptures occurring intraoperatively during TKP. This kind of complica-tions due to extensor mechanisms is mentioned to be associated rather with revision TKPs \\[21.\n\n【24】Extensor mechanism in TKP is very important for postoperative rehabilitation of the patient. The pa-tients undergoing TKP should be allowed to move early in order to prevent occurrence of stiff knee and weakness of extensor mechanism after the operation\\[3\\]. Unexpected rupture of patellar tendon and prima-ry repair without augmentation of this complication during TKP may lead to undesired complications such as occurrence of stiff knee and weakness of extensor mechanism as well as delay in rehabilitation. Thus， repair of patellar tendon rupture occurring during TKP should allow effective healing of the tendon as well as early movement of the knee with TKP by minimizing the risk ofre-rupture.\n\n【25】Our aim in the current article is to report outcome of our patient who underwent patellar tendon augmenta-tion with cerclage wire in addition to primary repair being technically simple and cheap，requiring minimal additional operation time， not adversely influencing healing ofthe patellar tendon， allowing postoperative early rehabilitation and being performed for patellar tendon rupture occurring suddenly during operation. Literature was also reviewed in the current article.\n\n【26】CASE REPORT\n\n【27】A 70 years old patient presented to our hospital with pain on the left knee. On her physical examination， flexion contracture of 20 degrees was found on the left knee and there was varus deformity of about 15degrees. Range of motion was painful. Precipitation was felt on palpation. There was no varus or valgus instability. Medial space was seen to narrow on the knee radiogram. The patient was diagnosed as having advanced stage gonarthrosis and she was scheduled to TKP operation. She had no additional chronic conditions. The patient was admitted to clinic and informed on the operation and she gave informed consent for the operation.\n\n【28】The patient was applied tourniquet and anterior midline incision was made after appropriate skin preparation had been made preoperatively in the\n\n【29】operation room. Then， knee joint was entered through parapatellar approach. Difficulty was experienced in patellar eversion as the patient had a stiff knee. The patellar fat pad was removed to facilitate exploration. However， minimal patellar tendon damage occurring at this stage resulted in rupture through subpatellar region during eversion. The operation was continued from the point it interrupted following occurrence of rupture. Bone sections were made appropriately and the prosthesis (Biomet) intersecting the posterior oblique ligament was placed with cement.\n\n【30】Following placement of the components， ruptured patellar tendon was primarily sutured according to Krackow technique with no： 5 ethibond suture. The patient underwent loop augmentation with cerclage wire through holes on the midpatellar and midtu-berositas sides in order to prevent occurrence of stiff knee and allow early movement postoperatively as well as for the possible risk of re-rupture due to early movement (figure1A-B). No additional complication occurred intraoperatively.\n\n【31】The patient was given full weight and began to move on the second postoperative day. Patient was dis-charged from the hospital on the 4th postoperative day. She was scheduled to monthly control visits. At the end of 6 months extension was full， flexion was 95degrees， the extensor mechanism was quite strong on the knee and the patient had apainless knee. At the end of 6 months， the wire was cut and removed by making mini-incisions under scopic guidance without entering the joint space (figure 2 A-B). Following the removal of the wire， the patient was instructed to make isometric quadriceps exercise and then was discharged.\n\n【32】DISCUSSION\n\n【33】Patellar tendon rupture may develop spontaneously in the patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as well as following injections of steroids. Cases have also been reported in the patients with metabolic diseases， repetitive micro-traumas， following realignment pro-cedures for distal patellar tendon and in those patients from whom bone-patellar， tendon-bone autografts for reconstruction of ACL \\[4-6\\].\n\n【34】Although true incidence of patellar tendon ruptures following TKP operation due to rarity of this condi-tion， the incidence has been reported as 0.17%\\[1\\]. No clear information， however， exists in the literature on the patellar tendon ruptures occurring intraopera-tively. This condition has usually been reported in the literature as in avulsion form in revision prosthesis surgery for the knee \\[2\\]. Although several operative\n\n【35】Figure 1A-B. The cerdlage wire applied in loop-manner， position of the patella and the components on 2-directional radiogram.\n\n【36】techniques and rehabilitation programs for patellar tendon rupture have been reported in the literature， there is not a“gold-standard”technique in the treat-ment of this condition.\n\n【37】Operations defined in the literature for patellar tendon rupture occurring after TKP include ten-sion band wiring of the extensor mechanism \\[7\\]， bone-patellar tendon-bone allograft \\[8\\]， extensor mechanism allograft \\[9\\]， semi-tendinosus tendon auto graft \\[10\\]， the leeds-keio ligament \\[11\\]lateral gastrocnemius muscle belly and achilles tendon\\[12\\] and semitendinosus-gracilis with interference screw and staple fixation \\[13\\]. These operations are especially for patellar tendon ruptures occurring postoperatively.\n\n【38】Additionally， removing the flexors of the knee for reconstruction of intraoperative patellar tendon rupture reduces the flexor strength \\[14\\]； moreover， it\n\n【39】is not easy to remove the tendons of semitendinosus or gracilis muscles in a knee in which the operation is being performed under tourniquet. Removal of these tendons may take a long time.\n\n【40】Although successful results have been reported with reconstruction with allograft， it is difficult to obtain allograft in patellar tendon rupture developing sud-denly in the operation. Even though such allografts are obtained， its durability during the process of rehabilitation and healing of graft tissue take a long time. Furthermore； occurrence of gaps， graft rupture， separation of the graft from the suture side and oc-currence of fracture in the allograft have reported in the patients in whom allografts were used \\[8， 9\\].\n\n【41】Achilles tendon allograft has been advised rather as a salvage procedure in the patients who underwent multiple operations and it has problems in healing of allograft \\[151.\n\n【42】A\n\n【43】B\n\n【44】Figure 2A-B. Views of the knee taken in flexion and extension positions following removal of the cerdlage wire.\n\n【45】All of these operations mentioned above are es-pecially for the patellar tendon rupture occurring postoperatively. Thus， they are operations requiring preparation. It may not be possible for every single surgeon to obtain allograft for intraoperative rupture in a patient undergoing operation for total primary knee operation.\n\n【46】develop due to immobilization following TKP. And finally， early movement may protect the patellar length by eliminating stress that may develop on the patellar tendon during movement. Because it may cause development of premature tendon lengthening and patella alta \\[17\\].\n\n【47】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【48】The reason for that we augmented the primary re-pair with cerclage wire is that we desired to begin to move the patient immediately in the postoperative period and to minimize the risk of rerupture in the patellar tendon by giving most of the weight oc-curring during this movement onto the wire. Early movement following TKP is required mainly for three reasons. Firstly， early movement in the tendon that underwent repair may lead to more organized fibri-lar matrix formation by increasing collagen synthesis\\[16\\].

Its treatment has been transformed by immunotherapy. Melanoma cells frequently have mutations that make them vulnerable to attack by the im-mune system， and this is how immunotherapy can fight this cancer. Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibi-tors targets mechanisms that malignant cells use to evade immune system detection， blocking proteins pro-duced by the tumor， and allowing the immune system to identify and attack cancerous cells.\n\n【24】Case Report：\n\n【25】A 74-year-old woman presented with a lump on the right side of her chest. Tests revealed a metastatic malig-nant tumor with melanocytic differentiation. Stage lV melanoma was diagnosed， and the patient started ther-apy with nivolumab/ipilimumab for palliative intent， which she tolerated without adverse effects. However， she was hospitalized for Clostridioides difficite colitis after 3 treatment cycles， and computed tomography (CT) scan findings suggested disease progression. Positron emission tomography (PET)-CT obtained after her discharge from the hospital showed a complete metabolic response at all disease sites， indicating the initial progression was most likely a pseudo-progression from the use of immunotherapy. The patient continued with nivolumab as a single agent and has been doing well.\n\n【26】Conclusions：\n\n【27】This case highlights the importance of careful evaluation of immunotherapy response in patients with mela-noma. The initial progression noted in this patient was most likely pseudo-progression， which resolved with further immunotherapy. Clinicians should consider PET-CT imaging in cases of suspected pseudo-progression to avoid unnecessary changes in therapy. Patient response to immunotherapy demonstrates the effectiveness of immunotherapy in treating advanced melanoma.\n\n【28】Keywords： Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors · Immunotherapy· Ipilimumab· Melanoma·Nivolumab\n\n【29】Full-text PDE https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/940954\n\n【30】Publisher's note： All daims expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of their affiliated\n\n【31】AP\n\n【32】organizations， or those of the publisher the editors and the reviewers.

Its treatment has been transformed by immunotherapy. Melanoma cells frequently have mutations that make them vulnerable to be attacked by the immune system and this is how immunotherapy can fight this cancer. Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors targets the mech-anisms that malignant cells use to evade detection by the im-mune system \\[1\\]. It blocks proteins produced by the tumor， which allows the immune system to identify and attack can-cerous cells. Pembrolizumab and nivolumab， both of which tar-get a protein called PD-1， are two of the most common check-point inhibitors used to treat melanoma. By preventing PD-1from functioning， these drugs enable T cells to attack melano-ma cells more effectively \\[2\\]. Immunotherapy has significantly enhanced melanoma patients' clinical outcomes and surviv-al， especially for those with metastatic disease \\[3\\]. Although immunotherapy can produce long-term remissions， not all pa-tients respond to it. Some patients can experience a phenom-enon called pseudo-progression， in which the inflammation in-side the tumor can give the appearance of increasing the size of the tumor. We present a case of pseudo-progression of mel-anoma treated with immunotherapy.\n\n【34】The patient was a 74-year-old woman with a medical histo-ry of hypertension and dyslipidemia who initially presented with a lump on the right side of her chest. The patient had a bilateral diagnostic mammogram， which noted enlargement of axillary lymph nodes bilaterally. Ultrasound noted an ab-normal appearing right axillary lymph node measuring 15 mm and a left axillary lymph node measuring 10 mm. An ultra-sound-guided right axillary lymph node biopsy discovered a metastatic malignant tumor with melanocytic differentiation. Genetic findings included NF1， CIC P331， TERT promoter， and amplification of FGF10，MITF， and RICTOR. KIT， NRAS，and BRAF V600 were negative for mutations. The PD-L1 tumor propor-tion score was 1%.\n\n【35】An initial positron emission tomography-computed tomogra-phy (PET-CT) scan noted metastatic involvement， with a soft tissue mass in the right (standardized uptake value \\[SUV\\] 13.8measuring 2.4x2.4 cm) and left (SUV 13.5 measuring 2.1×1.8cm) chest wall， a large right lower lobe lung mass measuring5.3x4 cm (SUV of 17.6)， and a lobular mass in the right abdo-men 2.5x2.2 cm (SUV 14.2) (Figure 1A-1C).\n\n【36】Figure 1. Images (A-C) show the initial positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan before treatment. The soft tissue masses in the right and left chest wall， the right lower lobe lung mass， and the lobular mass in the right abdomen are marked with red circles. Images (D-F) show the complete metabolic response at all disease sites.\n\n【37】Figure 2. Computed tomography scan showing findings suggestive of disease progression， with enlargement of the intra-abdominal mass posterior to the lower portion of the right kidney and the subcutaneous masses anterior to the right shoulder and on the left chest wall. The masses are marked with red circles.\n\n【38】Stage IV melanoma was diagnosed， and the patient started ther-apy with nivolumab/ipilimumab every 21 days for 4 cycles for palliative intent， which she tolerated without adverse effects. Unfortunately， the patient was hospitalized for Clostridioides difficile colitis after 3 treatment cycles. A CT scan of the chest， abdomen， and pelvis with contrast was obtained at that time， and the findings were suggestive of disease progression， with enlargement of the subcutaneous masses anterior to the right shoulder (2.5×1.8 cm)， left chest wall (2.4 cm)， and the intra-abdominal mass posterior to the lower portion of the right kidney (2.6 cm). The right lung mass was stable (Figure 2).\n\n【39】After the standard treatment of antibiotics， she was discharged. Although the CT imaging was worrisome for disease progres-sion， clinically， she was doing well. A decrease in the size of her subcutaneous masses involving the right and left chest wall was noted on her physical examination during her out-patient follow-up 2 weeks after her discharge. Therefore， we decided to obtain new PET-CT imaging for further evaluation. The new PET-CT showed a complete metabolic response at all disease sites (Figure 1D-1F). The initial progression was most likely a pseudo-progression from the use of immunotherapy， as it was seen only at the previously known areas of disease involvement， with no new sites of metastasis and complete re-sponse on subsequent imaging without additional therapies. Given the great response to immunotherapy， the patient con-tinued her immunotherapy with nivolumab as a single agent and has been doing well.\n\n【40】Discussion\n\n【41】Pseudo-progression is a phenomenon in which tumors ap-pear to grow or worsen on imaging scans after a patient has undergone immunotherapy treatment. While this can initial-ly be concerning， it could represent a response to the treat-ment. Pseudo-progression in melanoma is estimated to occur\n\n【42】in less than 10% of the patients treated with PD-1 inhibi-tors \\[4，5\\]. This pseudo-progression occurs because immuno-therapy stimulates the immune system to attack and destroy malignant cells. This can cause inflammation， making tumors appear larger on scans due to swelling. However， this inflam-mation should eventually subside， and the tumors will de-crease in size. It is imperative to closely monitor the patient while on treatment to distinguish between pseudo-progres-sion and lack of response to treatment with real disease pro-gression， as treatment decisions can differ. Differentiating between pseudo-progression and tumor progression can be challenging. To facilitate this differentiation， the iRECIST cri-teria were proposed to guide when to perform imaging eval-uations and how to interpret new lesions \\[6，7\\]. Although this method is helpful， it has its limitations， and this differentia-tion requires a careful evaluation of imaging， timing， and oth-er clinical factors. Regular imaging tests may not help to dif-ferentiate between both. Depending on the situation， a PET scan or repeat biopsies can be necessary to confirm whether the apparent growth is due to inflammation or actual disease progression \\[8\\]. While pseudo-progression can be a concern-ing phenomenon， the clinical evaluation of the patient should be considered when deciding to continue with immunothera-py or to change to an alternative therapy.\n\n【43】Conclusions\n\n【44】This case highlights the importance of careful evaluation of immunotherapy response in patients with melanoma. The ini-tial progression noted in this patient was most likely a pseu-do-progression， which resolved with further immunotherapy. Clinicians should consider PET-CTimaging in cases of suspected pseudo-progression to avoid unnecessary changes in therapy. The patient's response to immunotherapy demonstrates the ef-fectiveness of immunotherapy in treating advanced melanoma.\n\n【45】Institution Where Work Was Done\n\n【46】UPMC Hillman Cancer Center， Harrisburg， PA， USA.\n\n【47】References：\n\n【48】1\\.

They have been shown to increase Cormack-Lehane (CL) levels in difficult laryn-goscopy and improve intubation success \\[1\\]. However， com-mercial video-laryngoscopes such as C-MAC (Karl Storz Gmbh& Co.， Tuttlingen， Germany)， GlideScope (Verathon Medical Inc.， Bothell， USA)， Airtraq (Prodol Meditec， Vizcaya， Spain)， Ambu Pentax-AWS (Ambu A/S， Ballerup， Denmark)，McGrath(Aircraft Medical Ltd.， Edinburgh， UK) and King Vision laryngo-scope (King systems， Noblesville， USA)， are considered expen-sive hence not available in many centres \\[2\\]. We describe our experience of using a custom made and inexpensive tool (which costs under the US $80-includes a complete laryngoscope set with 3 different sized Macintosh blades) that can be used to perform video-laryngoscopy.\n\n【15】This study is a double randomized clinical trial conducted at the Anesthesiology Department of Sanglah General Hospital Den-pasar. Health Research Ethical Clearance Committee of Sanglah General Hospital with protocol number： VALID \\[2021.02.1.0567\\] released on February 22， 2021. There were 25 patients aged 18-65 years old，both male and female， American Society of Anesthe-siologists (ASA) classification of 1 -4， elective-emergency， either performed in the Central Operating Theatre (COT) / Emergency Room (ER) / Very Important Person (VIP) Operating Theatre， in March 2021， randomly selected， to be involved in this study for video-laryngoscopy. This study is a prospective study. The video-laryngoscopy in those 25 cases was performed by the first and second-year anesthesiology residents. Preoperative airway assessment was conducted， and those with Mallampati grades of1-4 were chosen. Difficult airway predictors， such as Mallampati and high Body Mass Index (BMI)， were anticipated as difficult airways. Patients with prominent teeth， large tongue， tracheal malformation， history of difficult airway， and those who refused to be involved in the study were excluded. Sampling was con-ducted using a non-probability consecutive sampling method with permutated block random sampling to obtain viable sub-jects. All patients included in this study and the laryngeal spe-cialist will know the use of the instrument before the study is carried out. There is no control in this study， and the sample size was predicted from a similar previous single-population study with the result of 25 samples required. All patients were pre-pared for intubation by performing pre-oxygenation for minutes using 100% oxygen， using the patient's spontaneous breathing. The induction was then performed with subsequent regimens：Fentanyl， as an analgesic agent， 2 microgram/kilogram body weight (kg BW) intravenous (TV) by titration， and then waited for 5 minutes， followed by hypnotic agent administration Propo-fol 1，5 mg/kg BW IV by titration. If there is a decrease in Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) and/or heart rate (HR) of more than20%， a 10mg IV bolus of ephedrine was given. Immediately after the patient fell asleep by observing the eyelashes reflex， a skele-tal muscle relaxant 0，5 mg/kg BW Ⅳ bolus of Atracurium was administered， followed by 4 minutes wait， and then followed by 1，5 mg/kg BW IV bolus of Lidocaine 2%， and then followed by 1-minute wait to reach the onset of sympathetic response blunting. After that， the laryngoscopy process was carried out.\n\n【16】The determination of thelaryngoscope’s blade size was based on the length of the lips against the temporomandibular joint(TMJ). This device was assembled by attaching a 5.5 millimetre(mm) diameter Wi-Fi-connected endoscopic camera (Shenzhen Technology Incorporation， China) to the Macintosh Laryngo scope blade sleeve to replace the bulb slot (Figure 1). The camera was installed approximately 50 mm from the tip of the laryn-goscope blade by keeping the image recorded visible on the monitor screen using our tailor-made cable clamp mechanism. The videos are directly recorded on the smartphone via Wi-Fi connectivity using the “Wi-Fi Check\" software (Shenzhen Tech-nology Incorporation).\n\n【17】The video was recorded in the MOV format during laryn-goscopy and intubation， which were then reviewed for observa-tion. The choice of the endotracheal tube was Polyvinyl Chloride(PVC) endotracheal tube with an internal diameter (ID) of 7，5 or7.0 mm in males and ID of 7，0 or 6，5 mm in females. The tube was used after general anesthesiology induction and muscle relaxant administration. The time needed for laryngoscopy was recorded， defined in second， taken from the time the laryngoscope blade\n\n【18】Figure 1 Device assembled using Wi-Fi-connected endoscope camera (A)， O-Mac@ design section (B)， handle (C)，O-Mac@set.\n\n【19】passed the maxillary incisor to the glottis visualization. The time needed for intubation was recorded， defined as in seconds from the entry of the laryngoscope blade into the oral cavity through the maxillary incisors until the confirmation of the air-way for ventilation. The best degree of CL was recorded before intubation was performed. The POGO score， calculated by the writer based on the previously recorded video on the smart-phone， was measured as the visualized linear glottic opening length to obtain the best glottic view before intubation.\n\n【20】Each external laryngeal manoeuvre (ELM) performed to optimize the laryngeal view was recorded \\[5\\]， including the use of supporting devices such as； Magill Forceps， Stylet， and Gum Elastic Boogie. The number of intubation attempts was also recorded； intubation attempt >2 times was considered in-valid. The attempt was stopped if the required time for intu-bation exceeded 120 seconds or oxygen saturation was <94%on the peripheral oximeter. After a failed intubation， the pa-tient was given manual ventilation using a ventilation bag and compressed air oxygen for at least 1 minute and/or until af-ter peripheral oxygen saturation returned to baseline (before intubation) before performing re-attempt. Any trauma such as bloodstains to the airway or injury to the hypopharyngeal or glottic structures， torn lips， broken teeth will be recorded. At the end of each intubation，the laryngoscope blade will be sterilized， and the endoscope camera will be immersed in a high-level dis-infection solution. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS20) software (IBM Corporation， Route100， Somers， NY， USA). Demographic data were analyzed using the 't-test’. Qualitative or categorical variables were described as frequencies and compared with a chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test， whichever is applicable. A p-value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. Normally distributed data were compared using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Non-parametric data were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance followed by the Mann-Whitney U-test for intergroup differences.\n\n【21】Results\n\n【22】Twenty-five patients aged 16-65 years， 13 males and 12 females， were enrolled. The glottis can be visualized， and intubation can be performed in all patients (Fig.2). The Wi-Fi-connected endoscope camera's 6 coaxial LED (light-emitting diode) system can adequately illuminate the laryngeal structure. The mean duration of laryngoscopy time was 16.76±15.49 (2-55) seconds. The time taken for intubation averaged 24.48±16.53(5-65) seconds. Visualized Cormack-Lehane grade was 1 in 7/25，2in 16/25 patients and 3 in 2/25 patients. The overall POGO score averaged 75.60±14.16(50-100)%. Moreover， in CL grade1 analysis， the mean was 81.42 ±14.63 (50-100)%； CL grade 2， mean 76.25 ±13.16(50-90)%； and CL grade 3， mean 55 ±28.28(50-60)%.\n\n【23】Figure 2 Video-laryngoscope views were obtained in 25 study patients with O-MacD.\n\n【24】When comparing patients with a “High\"POGO score (50-100%) and a“Low\" score (0-50%)， there is a significant difference in the meantime of laryngoscopy (21 seconds in High vs 25 sec-onds in Low，p-value=0.004). In contrast， there was a significant difference in the meantime required for intubation (19.71 sec-onds in High vs 50.14 seconds in Low， p-value=0.003) (Fig. 3). Therefore， external laryngeal manipulation is required in 4/25patients for optimal viewing. Use a stylet in 7/25 patients to facilitate angulation of insertion into the trachea. In5/5 patients with anticipated difficult airways， intubation was successful on the first try.\n\n【25】Figure 3 Laryngoscopy and intubation time versus POGO score.\n\n【26】No tissue damage resulted from all intubation attempts. Real-time video can be recorded in all cases. The O-MacQ can be assembled before use in about 45-60 seconds. This includes the time to connect the device to the smart device we have， correct the up-down orientation of the real-time video image by looking at the letters on the paper and secure the camera to the laryngoscope blade using a click-on mechanism we have designed ourselves.\n\n【27】Discussion\n\n【28】Video-laryngoscopy has been shown to improve the success of easy and difficult airway intubations. We learn the patient， using\n\n【29】Figure 4 The 3D plot shows the inverse relationship between intubation time and POGO score.\n\n【30】a special device assembly， without excluding a difficult airway. The overall success of intubation on the first try was 88% (22/25) without failure. Installation of the breath tube using the extra laryngeal manoeuvre as much as 16% (4/25)， stylet as much as 28%(7/25)， and the remaining was 56% (14/25) did not use any auxiliary tools / techniques. The average time taken for laryngoscopy was 16.76 ±15.49 (2-55) seconds， comparable to， although higher than， commercial devices such as GlideScope：mean duration 13 (5-34) seconds and C-MAC D-blade： 11 (5-45) seconds \\[7-9\\]. The time taken to intubation， averaging 24.48 ±16.53 (5-65) seconds， is also comparable with several studies of intubation time for GlideScope \\[7，8， 10\\]. However， there is a wide hetero-unity between the times obtained by the intubator\\[10\\].\n\n【31】The POGO score used to assess glottic appearance was re-ported to have higher observational reliability than the CL as-sessment \\[4\\]. In our study， although CL grade 2 was obtained in 16/25 patients， there was wide variation in the POGO scores in these patients， averaging 75.60±14.16(50-90)%. An inverse association was observed between the time analysis for laryn-goscopy and intubation versus the POGO score， with a greater time being obtained for a lower POGO score (Fig. 3). Lower POGO scores (0-50%) were associated with a significantly longer intubation time (19.71 seconds in High vs 50.14 seconds in Low， p-value=0.003). However， the time to laryngoscopy was similar to those with a higher POGO score. We confirmed the usefulness of this scoring system in video-laryngoscopy.\n\n【32】In a patient with a low POGO score， the glottic opening was visualized at the top of the real-time video image， suggest-ing likely a more anterior laryngeal anatomy (Fig. 2). ELM is required in 1/3 of patients with a“Low\"POGO score. We attempted to obtain a higher POGO score in these patients us-ing ELM prior to the attempt of intubation because previous studies have shown a possible utility in increasing the POGO score \\[11\\]. We also found ELM to be useful in aligning the glottic opening， thereby providing an optimal entry angle for a stylized endotracheal tube， similar to another study \\[5\\].\n\n【33】It is uncertain whether the device contributes to the“Low”POGO score in some patients， as there is no comparison with commercially available direct laryngoscopy or video laryngo-scopes. Compared to conventional laryngoscopy or other com-mercially available video-laryngoscopes， the time required for laryngoscopy is slightly higher (about 12 seconds). This could be because those performing the laryngoscopy and intubation procedures still have minimum experiences to perform these procedures.\n\n【34】Table 1 Characteristics of Research Data Results\n\n| Parameter  | O-Mac n (25)  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Age (year， mean ±SD)  | 43，64±14，04  |\n| Gender (Male ： Female)  | 13：12  |\n| Operation Room (Emergency Unit ： Central Surgical Installation)  | 21：4  |\n| Physical Status (ASA1：2： 3)  | 3：12：10  |\n| ASA Advanced Classification (Elective ： Emergency)  | 21：4  |\n| Mallampati (1：2：3)  | 4：16：5  |\n| Laryngoscope User (Resident 1： 2)  | 17：8  |\n| MAP After Induction mmHg (mean ±SD)  | 74，88±9，24  |\n| MAP After Intubation Attempts mmHg (mean ±SD)  | 84，88±17，59  |\n| HR After Induction Beats/minute (mean±SD)  | 76，60±8，94  |\n| HR After Intubation Attempts Beats/ minute (mean ± SD)  | 81，12±9，38  |\n| Laryngoscope Duration seconds (mean ±SD)  | 16，76±15，49  |\n| Intubation Duration seconds (mean ± SD)  | 24，48±16，53  |\n| Cormack-Lehane Degrees (1：2：3)  | 7：16：2  |\n| POGO (Percentage of Glottic Opening) (mean ±SD)  | 75，60±14，16  |\n| Use of tools (without tools ： Stylet： BURP)  | 16：6：3  |\n| Number of Intubation Attempts (1：2)  | 23：2  |\n| Difficulty Level (Medium ： Easy)  | 7：18  |\n| Tissue Damage  | None  |\n| Physical Condition of the Laryngoscope User  | Healthy  |\n| Individual Opinions Toward Laryngoscope Users (Uncomfortable ： Ordinary： Comfortable)  | 1：1：23  |\n| Action sucCeSs  | Success  |\n| BMI  | 22，83±3，09  |\n| Delta MAP (%) (mean ± SD)  | 15.04±23，04  |\n| Delta HR (%) (mean ±SD)  | 6.49±4，52  |\n\n【36】MAP： Mean Arterial Pressure； HR： Heart Rate； BMI： Body Mass Index.\n\n【37】Table 2 Comparison of Data Parameters\n\n| Parameter  | p-value  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Age VS Duration of intubation time  | 0，342  |\n| POGO VS Duration of intubation time  | 0，193  |\n| POGO VS Duration of laryngoscope time  | 0，004\\*  |\n| Duration of intubation time VS Duration of laryngoscope time  | 0，003\\*  |\n| Mallampati VS Cormack-Lehane degrees  | 0，007\\*  |\n| Mallampati VS Use of tools  | 0，021\\*  |\n| Cormack-Lehane Degrees VS Delta MAP  | 0，458  |\n| Cormack-Lehane Degrees VS Delta HR  | 0，386  |\n| Mallampati VS Number of intubation attempts  | 0，036\\*  |\n| Place of intubation VS Duration of intubation  | 0，392  |\n| Use of tools VS delta MAP  | 0，361  |\n| Use of tools VS delta HR  | 0，473  |\n| Age VS duration of intubation  | 0，342  |\n| Gender VS intubation duration  | 0，501  |\n| BMI VS Mallampati  | 0，351  |\n| BMI VS Cormack-Lehane Degrees  | 0，568  |\n| Age VS BMI  | 0，282  |\n\n【39】\\*p-value < 0，05： significant\n\n| Parameters (mean ±SD)  | Stages of Resident 1n= 17  | Stages of Resident 2 n=18  | p-value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Laryngoscope time duration  | 18，41±16，68  | 16±14，86  | 0，723  |\n| Duration of intubation time  | 26，94±17，92  | 22，88±15，57  | 0，515  |\n| Delta MAP  | 4，71±4，22  | 37±31，12  | 0，360  |\n| Delta HR  | 6，54±4，57  | 6，38±4，70  | 0，247  |\n| Use of tools  | 1，12±0，70  | 0，25±0，71  | 0，897  |\n\n【41】\\*p-value <0，05\n\n【42】The incidence of airway trauma was not found， even in 3 pa-tients with low POGO scores.

Initial presenting symptoms usually vary from shortness of breath， cough， chest pain， and superior vena cava syndrome to nonspecific constitutional symptoms (eg， fever， weight loss， fatigue). However， the initial presentation of a mediastinal mass with acute pericarditis has not been reported in the literature as far as we know.\n\n【26】Case Report： A 20-year-old man presented to the Cardiology Clinic with chest pain and new pericardial effusion on echo-cardiography， both fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of acute pericarditis. The patient also had venous engorge-ment on the neck， and a chest X-ray followed by computed tomography imaging showed a large mediastinal mass. The serum tumor marker o-fetoprotein (AFP) was markedly elevated. The biopsy and immunohistochem-istry revealed a high-grade malignant neoplasm - yolk sac tumor， which is a type of non-seminomatous germ cell tumor. The acute pericarditis resolved after administration of NSAID and colchicine. The patient was then started on chemotherapy.\n\n【27】Conclusions：\n\n【28】The discussed case shows the rare presentation of an anterior mediastinal mass with acute pericarditis. This emphasizes the importance of a thorough review of systems and critical analysis of every sign and symptom at the time of initial presentation， which helps the physician to obtain appropriate imaging studies early in the course， leading to an early diagnosis and treatment of the disease， such as in this case of an extremely rare germ cell tumor.\n\n【29】Keywords： Mediastinal Neoplasms· Medical Oncology· Nonseminomatous Germ Cell Tumor ·Pericarditis▪Yolk Sac\n\n【30】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/932616\n\n【31】Mediastinal masses can originate from anatomical structures nor-mally located in the mediastinum (eg，lymph nodes， the heart and its vessels， thymus)， or from structures that travel through the mediastinum during embryogenesis (eg， esophagus，trachea， thy-roid). However， many mediastinal masses are metastatic from ex-tramediastinal malignancies. Regardless of the origin of the mass， presenting symptoms with mediastinal masses are generally due to extrinsic compression of structures in the mediastinum， such as dyspnea， chest pain， and cough. The anterior mediastinum is the most common location where mediastinal masses occur in adults. Thymoma， (“Terrible\")lymphoma， Teratoma/germ cell tu-mor， and intrathoracic Thyroid tissue (mnemonic： the “terrible Ts\") are examples of the most common anterior mediastinal masses.\n\n【32】We present the case of a rare germ cell tumor (GCT) of the an-terior mediastinum in a 20-year-old patient. The patient pre-sented with chest pain suggestive of pericarditis (which was demonstrated by its combination with new pericardial effu-sion) and engorgement of the neck veins. Later， he was diag-nosed with a mediastinal yolk sac tumor， which is usually a highly malignant and aggressive germ cell tumor. Although clinical features of mediastinal GCTs have been well described(including chest pain and malignant pericardial effusion \\[1\\])， initial presentation with acute pericarditis has not been re-ported in the literature as far as we know.\n\n【33】Case Report\n\n【34】A 20-year-old man with no significant past medical/surgical his-tory initially presented to the Cardiology Clinic reporting chest pain for 5 weeks. The pain was sharp， episodic (lasting for few hours)， non-exertional， non-radiating， and gradually progres-sive (varying from 4 to 8 out of 10 in intensity)， that was re-lieved on leaning forward and taking a non-steroidal anti-in-flammatory drug (NSAID). Review of systems was positive for occasional dry cough and neck pain associated with some sen-sation of fullness on the left side of his neck. The patient was not on any home medications. He denied shortness of breath， paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea， and orthopnea， and he denied having fever， chills， night sweat， diaphoresis， nausea， vomiting， fatigue， abdominal pain， diarrhea， hemoptysis， blurry vision， upper-limb edema or heaviness， facial swelling， or headaches.\n\n【35】A physical exam was significant for tachycardia (heart rate was 105 beats per minute and regular)， low body weight， and engorged neck veins (Figure 1). The patient’s blood pressure was 125/87 mmHg. Cardiac auscultation showed normal heart sounds without rubs or murmurs. According to the patient and family members， “he has always been skinny.\" There was no palpable adenopathy present in the neck， axilla， or groin.\n\n【36】Figure 1. Initial presentation of the patient： physical exam was significant for engorgement of the neck veins (shown by the arrows).\n\n【37】Laboratory findings were significant for elevated LDH (773IU/L \\[reference range： 313-618 IU/L\\])， CRP (4.1 mg/dL \\[refer-ence range： 0.5-1 mg/dl\\])， and AFP (15220 ng/mL \\[reference range： <6.1 ng/mL\\]). Thyroid function， B-hCG， and ESR were normal. EKG showed sinus tachycardia and mild ST elevation needing differential diagnosis between acute pericarditis and early repolarization. The persistence of findings after treat-ment supports the latter.\n\n【38】Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed a left ventricu-lar ejection fraction of 45-50%， with small pericardial effusion.\n\n【39】Since the patient was fulfilling 2 of 4 diagnostic criteria sug-gested by the guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology， he was started on naproxen (an NSAID) for 2 weeks and colchi-cine for 3 months. With this regimen， the chest pain resolved in less than 1 week. Of note， treatment guidelines suggest us-ing ibuprofen as the primary NSAID.\n\n【40】Regarding other signs of pericarditis， his CRP ultimately de-creased to 1.5 mg/d and pericardial effusion was absent on a subsequent TTE done 4 months later.\n\n【41】A chest X-ray was performed for evaluation of cough and neck vein distention. It showed a large mediastinal mass(Figure 2A， 2B).\n\n【42】A CT study of the anterior mediastinum demonstrated a large， heterogeneous， solid soft tissue mass in the retrosternal space measuring 8.4 cm in length， 8.1 cm across， and 5.1 cm in AP diameter (Figure 3A). There were enlarged lymph nodes： left supraclavicular lymph node (1.2 cm)； Right hilar lymph node(1.4 cm) and left hilar lymph node (1.2 cm)； left anterior me-diastinal node (1.5 cm). The superior vena cava (SVC) in the right paratracheal space was extrinsically compressed and nar-rowed by the anterior mediastinal mass， with retrograde filling\n\n【43】Figure 2. (A) Chest X-ray (PA view) showing large mediastinal mass (marked fullness in the right suprahilar， paratracheal， and anterior superior mediastinal region， predominantly right-sided). (B) Chest X-ray (lateral view)， mediastinal mass outlined.\n\n【44】Figure 3. (A) CT scan of the chest with IV contrast showing large， heterogenous， solid soft tissue mass in the anterior mediastinum(8.4×8.1×5.1 cm) with extrinsic compression and narrowing of the superior vena cava in right paratracheal space by the mass.

There was no hepatospleno-megaly or biliary dilatation. For further evaluation of the an-terior mediastinal mass compressing the SVC， the patient was hospitalized and was seen by the Hematology-Oncology team. An endovascular stent was not placed， as the KISHI score was2 (only cough and neck vein distention).\n\n【46】CT-guided core-needle biopsy of the primary substernal mass was performed and tumor markers were sent for analysis. Biopsy revealed a high-grade malignant neoplasm of uncer-tain type， evidence of marked cytologic atypia with spindle cell features (Figure 4A)， and prominent tumor necrosis.\n\n【47】Immunohistochemistry staining was supportive of a germ cell tumor with positive staining with AE-1/AE-3； CAM5.2； PLAP(Figure 4B)； SALL4； AFP and Glypican-3； negative staining with Desmin， S100， CEA， monoclonal CK5/6， TTF1， Napsin A OCT3/4， CD30， HCG， and Podoplanin. The KI-67 proliferation marker re-sult was 80% (suggestive of aggressive，increased cellular pro-liferation). Based on these results， the patient was diagnosed with a primary mediastinal yolk sac tumor (YST). Of note， tes-ticular ultrasound (US) showed no mass.\n\n【48】The patient was planned for chemotherapy with 4 cycles of bleomycin， etoposide， and cisplatin (BEP regimen). He received2 cycles of BEP， but pulmonary function tests showed a de-crease in DLCO (44%). A subsequent high-resolution CT scan showed airspace opacities in the lingula and lateral basal seg-ment ofthe left lower lobe， small left pleural effusion， and at-electasis likely as adverse effects of bleomycin. For this rea-son， the BEP regimen was stopped， although the tumor was getting smaller. CXR after 2 cycles of BEP showed improved widening of the superior mediastinum.\n\n【49】A CT scan of the chest without contrast showed an interval reduction in the size of the anterior mediastinal mass. It also\n\n【50】revealed the nodule in the right middle lobe and a new 3-mm nodule in the lateral basal segment of the right lower lobe of the lung (Figure 3B). The patient was then started on a VIP regimen (etoposide， ifosfamide， and cisplatin).\n\n【51】The patient completed a total of 2 cycles of the BEP regimen and 2 cycles of the VIP regimen. A PET scan was obtained af-ter chemotherapy， which showed partial response with resid-ual mediastinal mass and few lung lesions that increased in size. Post-treatment AFP was 335.4 ng/mL. Of note， the neck vein engorgement had also improved. The patient was re-start-ed on the VIP regimen for further optimization for surgery.\n\n【52】Discussion\n\n【53】Most germ cell tumors (GCTs) develop in the testes and ovaries. Extragonadal GCTs (EGGCTs) are rare and account for 1-5% of all GCTs \\[2\\]. They typically arise in midline locations from the pineal gland to the coccyx： the mediastinum， retroperitone-um， CNS， and sacrococcygeal region \\[3\\]. There is a theory that EGGCTs develop due to failure of the migration of primordial germ cell (PGC) remnants to the gonadal ridge \\[4\\].\n\n【54】GCTs account for approximately 10-15% of anterior medias-tinal masses in adults \\[5\\]. Mediastinal GCTs are classified as seminomatous or non-seminomatous GCTs， with the latter in-cluding yolk sac tumor (YST)， choriocarcinoma， embryonic car-cinoma， and mixed GCTs \\[6\\].\n\n【55】Mediastinal YST is a rare， highly malignant， and aggressive GCT， that mainly affects young men and is visualized on chest X-ray or CT scan of the chest \\[7\\]. They can be locally invasive and can trigger early lymphatic and/or hematogenous metas-tasis. Our patient had regional lymph node involvement but no distant metastasis on initial presentation.\n\n【56】AFP levels can be used to support the diagnosis of YST and also as a marker， whether or not the treatment of YST was effective \\[7\\].\n\n【57】The immunohistochemical phenotype of mediastinal YSTs has similarities with testicular YST. The analysis of 14 cases of pri-mary mediastinal YSTs by Weissferdt et al \\[8\\] demonstrated characteristic co-expression of CAM5.2 and SALL4 (strong and diffuse expression present in 100% of cases)； Glypican-3 and AFP (expressed with a patchy pattern present in 71% of cases). Other immunohistochemical markers that can be expressed include placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP)， GATA-3， CDX2， CD117， and CD30.\n\n【58】By the time the diagnosis is made， mediastinal YST is frequently advanced， massive， and inoperable. According to Geng et al \\[9\\]，“primary mediastinal locations of YST and distant Surveillance， Epidemiology， and End Results (SEER) Summary stage are as-sociated with poor prognosis； receiving surgery is a good prog-nostic factor.\" That study refers to the male patients.\n\n【59】According to Bokemeyer et al \\[10\\]， international analysis of more than 600 cases of extragonadal germ cell tumors showed that the mediastinal GCTs usually present with the following symptoms： dyspnea (25%)， chest pain (23%)， cough (17%)， fever (13%)， weight loss (11%)， superior vena cava syndrome(6%)， fatigue (6%)， non-chest pain (5%)， and other less fre-quent symptoms. There have been cases of Horner syndrome(damage to sympathetic trunk)， and hypotension (cardiac tam-ponade or cardiac compression). However， initial presentation with acute pericarditis (diagnosed with ≥2 out of 4 diagnostic criteria as per the European Society of Cardiology \\[11\\]) is ex-tremely uncommon. It is unclear why our patient developed pericarditis. This can be related to the specific anatomical lo cation of the tumor with resultant irritation of the pericardial layers or even some undiagnosed autoimmune phenomenon.\n\n【60】Our patient's chest pain and tachycardia resolved a few days after starting NSAID and colchicine. However， the other EKG findings persisted after completing the course of treatment for pericarditis. This indicates that the ST elevations seen on\n\n【61】References：\n\n【62】1\\.

Our patient's initial presentation of long-standing chest pain re-lieved by leaning forward and with NSAIDS， tachycardia， and small pericardial effusion on TTE led to the initial diagnosis of acute pericarditis. This eventually turned out to be a rare， highly malignant primary yolk sac tumor of the mediastinum.\n\n【72】The case shows the unusual presentation of an anterior me-diastinal mass with acute pericarditis， thus emphasizing the importance of a thorough review of systems and critical anal-ysis of every sign and symptom at the time of initial presen-tation； this helps the physician to obtain appropriate imaging studies and to make an early diagnosis of the disease， such as a rare anterior mediastinal neoplasm. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment are the most important steps to avoid high morbidity and mortality from this condition.\n\n【73】Acknowledgments\n\n【74】We thank the patient for his cooperation and for consenting to publication of this case report.\n\n【75】Declaration of Figures'Authenticity\n\n【76】All figures submitted have been created by the authors who confirm that the images are original with no duplication and have not been previously published in whole or in part.\n\n【77】4\\.

We report a clinical case with progressive cholestatic disease following severe COVID-19. AST and ALT peaked at hospital admission and while its serum concentration went down， bilirubin and cholestatic liver enzymes started to increase， reaching the maximum at day 122.

However， persistent liver dam-age after the acute phase of the disease is uncommon and has recently been recognized as a new entity \\[3\\]. Liver disease usually seen in COVID-19 patients is related to hepatocellular damage， associated with elevation of aspartate aminotrans-ferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Nevertheless， the elevation of canalicular enzymes and bilirubin occurs in12% of cases \\[1，4\\].\n\n【29】Moreover， a relationship between liver damage and disease severity has recently been observed \\[5\\]. In most of these cas-es， serum liver enzyme levels are within 1-2 times the upper limit of normal and regress to normal values with healing of the disease \\[1-3\\]. However， prolonged and severe cholestasis during recovery from severe COVID-19 is observed in some cases， and it is considered a novel entity， named post-COVID cholangiopathy \\[3\\]， which may be severe enough to be treat-ed by liver transplantation \\[6\\]. Here， we report a clinical case of progressive cholestatic disease following severe COVID-19.\n\n【30】Case Report\n\n【31】The patient was a 66-year-old man diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2infection by RT-PCR assay 2 months before admission to our hospital， with septic shock， hemodynamic instability， and the need for orotracheal intubation on the 7th day of the disease. He was transferred to Hospital Sirio-Libanes with pulmonary insufficiency and renal failure requiring respiratory support and hemodialysis. Before the COVID-19， he had a medical history of arterial hypertension， moderate alcoholism， and coronary disease with the placement of 2 stents.\n\n【32】Initial laboratory tests collected at hospital admission are shown in Table 1.\n\n【33】Endoscopy revealed a Dieulafoy gastric lesion and esopha-geal ulcers due to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. An ab-dominal ultrasound showed slight hepatomegaly and no bile duct dilatation.\n\n【34】The patient received blood transfusions， antibiotics， cortico-steroids， and ganciclovir， with slight improvement. No throm-bosis was diagnosed. His pulmonary function improved； how-ever， his acute kidney injury persisted and he required regular hemodialysis.\n\n【35】Despite the hemodynamic， pulmonary， and renal improvement and CMV treatment for 21 days (PCR for CMV became unde-tectable)， cholestatic enzymes continued to increase， as shown\n\n| Laboratory test  | Result  | Normal Values  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hemoglobin  | 7.4g/dL  | 12.0-15.5 g/dl  |\n| Hematocrit  | 22.0%  | 35.0-45.0%  |\n| Leukocytes  | 36 660/mm  | 3500-10.500mm卜  |\n| Neutrophils  | 34 940/mm  | 1700-7000 mm  |\n| Lymphocytes  | 370/mm²  | 900-2900mm  |\n| Platelets  | 151 000/mm²  | 150 000-450 000mm  |\n| Glucose  | 107 mg  | 70-00 mg/dL  |\n| C reactive protein  | 23.95 mg/dL  | <0.3 mg/dL  |\n| Creatinine  | 4.03 mg/dL  | 0.60-1.10 mg/dL  |\n| Urea  | 188 mg/dL  | 10-50 mg/dL  |\n| Sodium  | 135 mEq/L  | 136-145mEq/l  |\n| Potassium  | 5.8 mEq/L  | 3.5-5.1mEq/L  |\n| INR  | 1.1  | 0.9-1.1  |\n| Albumin  | 1.9 g/dL  | 3.5-4.95 g/dL  |\n| Alkaline phosphatase  | 294  | 35-104 U/L  |\n| GGT  | 625 U/L  | 8-41 U/L  |\n| AST  | 127 U/L  | <32 U/L  |\n| ALT  | 86 U/L  | <33 U/L  |\n| Total bilirubin  | 1.8 mg/dL.  | 0.2-1.10 mg/dL  |\n\n【37】in Table 2. At that time， metabolic and genetic markers， as well as antibodies against autoimmune hepatic diseases， serolo-gies， and PCRs for the hepatotropic and non-hepatotropic vi-ruses， were all negative. Serum immunoglobulin IgG， IgA， IgM， and gamma globulin levels were within the reference ranges.\n\n【38】Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) re-vealed a diffuse irregularity of the intra-and extrahepatic bile ducts， with multiple focal strictures alternating with mild fo-cal dilations of the biliary tree (Figure 1)， suggesting scleros-ing cholangiopathy， confirmed by a transjugular liver biopsy.\n\n【39】We also noted biliary cast on MRI that on retrograded chol-angiography was found to be a hematic thrombus. The pa-tient also had higher levels of serum ammonia (>250)， with neurological symptoms being treated with continuous hemo-dialysis sodium benzoate， ursodeoxycholic acid， and cortico-steroids. After clinical treatment， the serum ammonia level decreased， and the patient partially recovered his neurologi-cal function； however， his liver function deteriorated continu-ously. Due to his poor clinical condition， liver transplantation was not performed.\n\n|  | Admission  | Peak  | Current  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| AST/ALT (IU/mL)  | 132/92  | 139/32  | 54/5  |\n| GGT/ALP (IU/mL)  | 625/294  | 2109/2031  | 568/786  |\n| Total bilirubin (mg/dL)  | 1.89  | 21.72  | 14.22  |\n| Creatinine (mg/dL)  | 4.03  | 4.03  | 1.677  |\n| C-Protein (mg/dL)  | 23.95  | 23.95  | 13.67  |\n\n【41】ALP - alkaline phosphatase.\n\n【42】Figure 1.

Portal fibrosis and bile ductular reaction- proliferation of small ductules at the periphery of the portal tract accompanied by neutrophils (10x， white arrow).\n\n【46】Pathological findings： Liver biopsy\n\n【47】A liver biopsy showed a prominent bile ductular reaction， chol-angiocyte injury， inflammatory infiltrate rich in neutrophils， bil-iary infarctions， marked cholestasis， and portal fibrosis. The bi-opsy demonstrated a degenerative cholangiocyte injury with extreme cholangiocyte cytoplasmic vacuolization and degen-erative changes (Figures 2-4).\n\n【48】Secondary sclerosing cholangitis in critically ill patients (SSC-CIP) has been reported in patients treated in an intensive care unit with hemodynamic instability due to infection， trauma， burns， and even cardiothoracic surgery \\[7\\]； however， the pre-cise mechanism of this disease remains unknown. A combina-tion of ductal ischemia， biliary infection， and bile composition alterations may interact to trigger the process \\[8，9\\].\n\n【49】Biliary duct ischemia seems to play a critical role in this pro-cess. It is known that biliary ducts receive their blood supply solely from branches of the hepatic artery； therefore， they are more susceptible to ischemia than hepatocytes that receive double blood supply from the portal vein and hepatic artery. Biliary duct ischemia damages the biliary epithelium with ne-crosis and biliary cast formation， as observed in the present case (Figure 1) \\[8，10\\]. Bile duct damage with loss of connec-tion to the central bile duct resulting in excluded bile ducts can make antibiotics ineffective， with prolonged sepsis and abscess formation， with high mortality \\[8\\].\n\n【50】Although this condition was initially related to long-term treat-ment in the intensive care unit， it seems that even a short-term stay in an intensive care unit can induce biliary duct dam-age \\[7\\]. Alterations in gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) were the predominant enzyme abnormality， which occurs ear-lier and is more intense than changes in alkaline phosphatase(ALP). Hyperbilirubinemia occurred in later stages， as observed in the case presented here. These findings are not specific， but they are helpful in distinguishing this condition from other dis-eases， such as septicemia-associated cholestasis， when hy-perbilirubinemia is an earlier and predominant event \\[11，12\\]. Rapid and extensive biliary duct destruction explains the in-tense fibrotic response and the need for liver transplantation.\n\n【51】Post-COVID-19 cholangiopathy is a special entity of liver in-jury that has been suggested as a variant of secondary scle-rosing cholangitis in critically ill patients (SSC-CIP)， but with unique histologic features \\[4\\]. This new entity was reported in patients recovering from a severe disease treated in intensive care units with vasopressor drugs， mechanical ventilation，and positive end-respiratory pressure， which increases the possibil-ity of microcirculatory ischemia in the hepato-splanchnic vas-cular plexus \\[12\\]. Increased proinflammatory cytokine levels also contribute to cholangiocyte damage \\[7\\]. Prolonged prone positioning frequently used in COVID-19 patients also seems to increase the risk of SSC-CIP \\[13\\]. Biliary epithelium ulcer-ation and hemorrhagic exudates in the bile ducts were also observed \\[9\\]. In the present case， we also observed intraduct-al bleeding with cast formation that induced retrograde chol-angiography exploration.\n\n【52】In the present case， it should be mentioned that， although the patient was chronically addicted to alcohol， no signs of chronic liver disease were detected on admission ultrasound or even in liver the biopsy， which also did not show histological signs of alcoholic hepatitis. The progression of cholestatic disease occurred later in during his hospital stay. AST and ALT peaked at hospital admission， and while serum concentrations de-creased， bilirubin and cholestatic liver enzymes started to in-crease， reaching a maximum on day 122 of his hospital stay. This biphasic pattern with initial transaminase elevations fol-lowed by cholestatic liver enzymes could reflect systemic in-flammatory response syndrome (SIRS)-induced cholestasis at the hepatocellular/canalicular level or more severe bile duct injury in the later stage of the disease \\[14\\].\n\n【53】In contrast to the histological findings from autopsy of pa-tients dying from COVID-19 with mild and focal lobular cho-lestasis with no derangement in bile ducts \\[15\\]，our patient s liver specimen showed extensive ductular reaction and degen-erative cholangiocyte injury with biliary ductular proliferation accompanied by neutrophils and portal fibrosis.\n\n【54】These histologic changes were described in direct hepatic inju-ry from COVID-19 in critically ill patients with underlying sec-ondary sclerosing cholangitis， although no clear signs of in-trahepatic microangiopathy were found， which could be due to the fact that the liver specimen was obtained via transjug-ular needle biopsy \\[6\\].\n\n【55】Conclusions\n\n【56】Most patients with SSC-CIP present with irreversible and pro-gressive liver disease， which requires liver transplantation \\[15\\]. Recently， it was reported that the first liver transplantation in a patient with post-COVID-19 SSC-CIP was performed \\[6\\]， which may be followed by several cases in the future. In con-clusion， post-COVID-19 SSC-CIP is a severe disease that usual-ly has no effective clinical treatment， and liver transplantation in selected patients is the only treatment at the present time.\n\n【57】Statement\n\n【58】Data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article and are in the electronic archives of Hospital Sirio Libanes Sao Paulo.\n\n【59】Declaration of Figures' Authenticity\n\n【60】All figures submitted have been created by the authors who confirm that the images are original with no duplication and have not been previously published in whole or in part.\n\n【61】1\\.

We present the case of a healthy， young individual with persistent myocardial in-volvement on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging at 10 months' follow-up.\n\n【25】Case Report：\n\n【26】A 23-year-old man with no prior medical conditions presented to our outpatient cardiology clinic with a chief concern of left-sided exertional chest discomfort of 1-week duration， lasting 30-60 min before resolving. The patient was previously active and ran 2 miles per day， 6 days a week without any issues. Three months prior to presentation， the patient had a mild case of COVID-19 managed conservatively on an outpatient basis. On eval-uation， the vital signs， physical examination， and laboratory work-up were unremarkable. Electrocardiography(EKG) displayed normal sinus rhythm with incomplete right bundle branch block. Transthoracic echocardiog-raphy (TTE) was normal. CMR was performed and indicated myopericarditis in several sub-epicardial and peri-cardial segments， with a quantitative scar burden of 18.6% on late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images us-ing the mean+5 SD method. A repeat CMR 7 months later demonstrated persistent sub-epicardial fibrosis with improvement in the LGE burden to 5.1% and resolution of pericarditis.\n\n【27】Conclusions： Myopericarditis with persistent myocardial scarring can be detected using CMR in healthy individuals with mild COVID-19 symptoms.

Data on management and prognosis of myo carditis in these patients are lacking， and there is little infor-mation regarding persistent LGE and myocardial scarring in acute post-COVID-19 syndrome. In this case report we pres-ent a healthy， young individual with persistent myocardial in-volvement on CMR at 10 months'follow-up.\n\n【32】Case Report\n\n【33】A 23-year-old man with no prior medical conditions present-ed to our outpatient cardiology clinic with a chief concern of left-sided exertional chest discomfort of 1-week duration. lasting 30-60 min before resolving. The patient was previous-ly active and ran 2 miles per day， 6 days a week without any issues. Three months prior to presentation， the patient had mild COVID-19 managed conservatively in the outpatient set-ting. Medical， surgical， and social history were unremarkable. A review of systems was positive for fatigue. Vital signs were within normal limits. A physical examination demonstrated no cardiopulmonary abnormalities. Comprehensive laborato-ry evaluation was unremarkable. Serum troponin was 12 ng/l(reference range 0-30 ng/l) and BNP (B-type natriuretic pep-tide) was <10 pg/ml (reference range <100 pg/ml). EKG dem-onstrated sinus bradycardia and an incomplete right bundle branch block (Figure 1). TTE revealed a left ventricular ejection\n\n【34】fraction (LVEF) of 60% with no valvular or wall motion abnor-malities. Given his current symptoms and prior COVID-19， CMR was ordered to evaluate for possible myocarditis. CMR was per-formed on a 1.5T Siemens scanner (Magnetom Aera/Gradient Spec XJ/Software version： VE11E). Various imaging sequences were performed， including： SSFP (steady-state free precession) cine images， along with tissue characterization using T1 map shortened Modified Look-Locker Inversion recovery sequence(ShMOLLI)， T2 map images， and LGE images using phase-sen-sitive inversion recovery (PSIR) sequence. CMR demonstrated a mildly dilated right atrium， but the rest of the cardiac cham-bers were normalin size. There was a normal LVEF of 54% and trace pericardial effusion was visualized. Global native T1 and T2 values were normal， indicating an absence of myocardial edema. The LGE images indicated the presence of several ar-eas of sub-epicardial as well as pericardial enhancement， sug-gestive of myopericarditis， with a quantitative LGE burden of18.6% (using the mean+5 SD method) (Figures 2， 3). A medi-cal regimen of colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily for 3 months and ibuprofen 600 mg 3 times daily for 14 days was initiated. At1-month follow-up， there was resolution of symptoms and a treadmill stress test was performed， which revealed good ex-ercise capacity with no symptoms or EKG abnormalities at 17METS. A repeat CMR was performed 7 months after initial pre-sentation， which demonstrated persistent sub-epicardial fi-brosis in the same distribution as the initially detected myo-pericarditis， with improvement in the LGE burden to 5.1% and resolution of pericarditis (Figures 4， 5).\n\n【35】Figure 2.

The present study was being done to compare the haemodynamic changes and glottic visualization during intubation between C-MAC， Mc Coy and Macintosh Laryngoscopes. Methods： We conducted the study on 150 patients under ASA I or ASA II scheduled for elective surgery. The patients were randomly assigned to one of the three groups， each containing 50 patients， using a computer-generated random allocation chart. The intubation was performed with Group-A (Macintosh)， Group-B (McCoy) and Group-C (C-MAC). Hemodynamic variables such as Heart rate， Systolic blood pressure， diastolic blood pressure， and mean arterial pressure were recorded before， during and till 5 minutes post-intubation， and glottis opening was assessed with Cormack Lehane grading. Observations and Conclusion： There was a statistically significant increase in hemodynamic parameters during laryngoscopy and intubation of patients of all the three study groups but less increase in hemodynamic responses were observed in patients intubated with McCoy laryngoscope when compared with patients intubated with Macintosh and C Mac laryngoscope. In addition， the C Mac laryngoscope shows better visualization of the glottis when compared to that of Macintosh and McCoy.\n\n【5】KEYWORDS Airway， laryngoscopes， hemodynamics\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Endotracheal intubation is a quick， non-invasive and harmless procedure that attains all the objectives of management of the airway， preserves patency of the airway shields the lungs from\n\n【8】Copyright @ 2022 by the Bulgarian Association of Young Surgeons DO： 10.5455/JMRCR.172-1646671453First Received： March 7， 2022Accepted： March 13， 2022Associate Editor： Ivan Inkov (BG)；'Corresponding author： Khalki Saravan Kumar； khalkiskt@gmail.com\n\n【9】aspiration and protects from trickle free ventilation all through mechanical ventilation and henceforth will be the gold standard practice for airway management.\n\n【10】The technique of laryngoscope sorts from direct to indirect， from the simple rigid scope with a light bulb to complex fi-bre optic video scopes to ease the process of laryngoscopy and intubation.23 The Powers employed by the laryngoscope blade on the base of the tongue while elating the epiglottis acts as a major stimulus for cardiovascular and airway responses.4 Glot-tic visualisation is classified by Cormack Lehane grading (CL grading).\n\n【11】There are two types of curved blades found in the common\n\n【12】·The Macintosh laryngoscope is the most frequently used de-vice for directly visualizing the structures of the larynx and facilitating tracheal intubation. While using the Macintosh blade， the tip of the blade is placed in the vallecula-the space between the base of the tongue and the pharyngeal surface of the epiglottis.\n\n【13】·The McCoy blade laryngoscope was introduced in 1993 and had an axis on the slant to prevent the elating force in the vallecula in that way depressing the hemodynamic reac-tion associated with laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation related to the regularly used Macintosh laryngoscopes.8\n\n【14】The Video laryngoscope was introduced into clinical practice by Kaplan and Berci in 2002.The C-MAC video laryngoscope is built like a standard Macintosh laryngoscope with a micro video camera and fibre-optic fibres built into the end of the blade. The benefits of C-MAC video laryngoscope merging the benefits of direct and video laryngoscopy in one device make it appropriate to help as a standard intubation instrument for difficult airway management and educational purposes for demonstration.\n\n【15】Few studies have compared these three laryngoscopes in the past few years. Hence， this study compared hemodynamic response and glottis view to laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation， with Macintosh blade and McCoy blades， C-Mac Laryngoscopy in general anaesthesia patients.\n\n【16】Materials and methods\n\n【17】This study was conducted in a prospective and randomized manner at our institute， from September 2019 to August 2021， in 150 adult patients after being approved by the Institutional ethics and scientific committee in Dr. D.Y.

Informed written consent was obtained from all the study partic-ipants and only those participants willing to sign the informed consent were included in the study. The risks and benefits in-volved in the study and the voluntary nature of participation were explained to the participants before obtaining consent. The confidentiality of the study participants was maintained.\n\n【39】The patients were allocated into the following groups：\n\n【40】·Group A of 50 patients was intubated with a Macintosh laryngoscope.\n\n【41】·Group B of 50 patients intubated with Mc Coy laryngoscope\n\n【42】· Group C of 50 patients intubated with CMAC video laryn-goscope\n\n【43】Pre-operative evaluation\n\n【44】All patients were thoroughly evaluated pre-operatively. All the relevant and necessary laboratory investigations were carried out.\n\n【45】All patients were kept NBM for a period of at least eight hours prior to surgery to avoid the risk of aspiration and other anaesthesia related complications.\n\n【46】Methodology\n\n【47】Intravenous line was secured using 20G IV cannula， and an infusion of Ringer Lactate (RL) was started. Demographic data such as age， sex， weight， height， MPC grading and ASA physical status of the patient were noted. Patient consent was noted down. Baseline vital monitors were attached， and parameters were noted down： heart rate， SPO2，ECG， and BP.\n\n【48】The patient was pre-oxygenated for 3-5 minutes with 100%oxygen using an appropriate size anatomical face mask. The pa-tients were premedicated with Inj. Glycopyrrolate (0.04mg/kg)， Inj.Midazolam (0.02 mg/kg) and Inj Fentanyl (2 mcg/kg body weight).\n\n【49】Anaesthesia was induced with propofol (2mg/kg). The feasi-bility of ventilation was checked prior to the depolarising muscle relaxant injection. After ventilation is confirmed， Inj. Succinyl-choline (2mg/kg) was administered and the patient was venti-lated with 100% O2. Laryngoscopy and intubation was carried out in a classical intubating positionby a single anaesthesiologist with either Macintosh， Mc Coy or video laryngoscopy in either study group.\n\n【50】It was ensured that the portable screen component of the video laryngoscope is properly attached and connected. Correct placement of endotracheal tube was confirmed by vocal cords visualization done by Cormack-Lehane grading The endotra-cheal tube was passed through vocal cords under the vision and re-confirmed by auscultation and capnography.\n\n【51】The haemodynamic parameters recorded were Heart Rate(HR)， Systolic blood pressure (SBP)， Diastolic blood pressure\n\n【52】(DBP)， and Mean arterial pressure (MAP). The above parameters were measured at the following intervals，\n\n【53】Baseline BL-T0， T1 - Before Induction， T2- After Induc-tion， T3- During Laryngoscopy T4 -1min after Intubation， T5-2min after Intubation， T6-3min after Intubation， T7-5min after Intubation.\n\n【54】1\\. Modified Cormack Lehane (CL) Grades for visualisation of the glottis：\n\n【55】Grade 1： Complete glottis visible\n\n【56】Grade 2 a： Partial view of the glottis\n\n【57】Grade 2b： Arytenoids or posterior part of the vocal\n\n【58】cords only just visible\n\n【59】Grade 3： Only epiglottis visible but not glottis\n\n【60】Grade 4： Neither glottis nor epiglottis is visible.\n\n【61】Maintenance of anaesthesia was done with nitrous oxide(60%)， oxygen (40%)， isoflurane 0.5-1%， and Inj vecuronium. At the completion of surgery residual neuromuscular block-ade was reversed with Inj. Neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and Inj Glycopyrrolate 0.008 mg/kg intravenously. After ex-tubation， the patients were shifted to the post anaesthesia recovery care unit， where they were monitored for an addi-tional half an hour.\n\n【62】2\\. Complications/Pressor response during laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation such as Local injuries， Bleeding， Laryngospasm， Regurgitation， Arrythmias， if observed， was noted and analysed.\n\n【63】Statistical methods\n\n【64】Descriptive analysis was carried out by mean and standard de-viation for quantitative variables， frequency and proportion for categorical variables. Data was also represented using appropri-ate diagrams like bar， pie， and box plots.\n\n【65】Statistical analysis was made with IBM SPSS 16.0 software and P value of <0.05 was considered significant.\n\n【66】One way ANOVA test is used for Continuous variables like Age， Weight， Height， Body Mass Index， Heart rate， Systolic Blood Pressure， Diastolic Blood Pressure， and Mean Arterial Pressure. Pearson's Chi-squared test is used for Categorical variables like ASA Physical Status， Gender， MPC classification， and Cormack-Lehane grading.\n\n【67】Observation and Results\n\n【68】Table 1 shows demographic profile of patients.\n\n【69】The table 2 shows the comparison of the Cormack Lehane grade at Laryngoscopy between three groups.\n\n【70】The Table 3 shows thee heart rate recorded during baseline， before induction， after induction， during intubation， 1min， 2min，3min and 5min after intubation.\n\n【71】The above table 4 shows， SBP recorded during baseline， be-fore induction， after induction， during intubation， 1min， 2min，3min and 5min after intubation.\n\n【72】In above table 5 shows， the DBP was recorded during base-line， before induction， after induction， during intubation， 1min，2min， 3min and 5min after intubation.\n\n【73】The table 6 shows， mean arterial blood pressure was recorded during baseline， before induction， after induction， during intu-bation， 1min， 2min， 3min and 5min after intubation.\n\n【74】Mean and standard deviation of mean arterial blood pressure were calculated at each interval. (P > 0.05 not significant， P <0.05significant).\n\n【75】No significant complications noticed during/ following the in-tubation of patients across all 3 groups.\n\n【76】Discussion\n\n【77】Airway management is the fundamental aspect of anaesthetic practice and emergency & critical medicine-laryngoscope and endotracheal intubation form an important step in administering general anaesthesia. In addition， the process of laryngoscopy is known to be associated with profound cardiovascular effects. Several studies comparing Macintosh and McCoy laryngoscopes and Macintosh and video laryngoscopes have been undertaken successfully in recent years to measure hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation； however， few research have examined these three laryngoscopes together. As a result， we’re comparing the stress responses and glottis visualization of the Macintosh， McCoy， and C-MAC video laryngoscopes during intubation.\n\n【78】Demographic factors\n\n【79】All three groups were comparable regarding age， gender， height， weight， BMI， MPC grades and ASA grading， and There was no significant difference among the three groups (P-value > 0.05).\n\n【80】Cormack Lehane grading\n\n【81】In the current study， In Group A， 42% of cases had CL grade1 and 58% of cases in Grade 2. In group B， 56% of cases had CL grade 1， and 44% had grade 2. In group C， 68% of cases had CL grade 1， and 32% had grade 2. There was statistical significance in comparing CL grading among the study groups(P-value 0.033). (Table no-10)\n\n【82】A better CL grading was observed among patients of group C when compared with group B and group A. Erol cavus et al. in 2011(9) it was noticed that in the subgroup of patients that had a suboptimal glottic view with MacIntosh (C/L≥2a； n=24)， the glottic view was improved in the C-MAC group， C/L class improved by three classes in 5 patients， by two classes in2 patients， by one class in 8 patients， remained unchanged in 8patients， or decreased by two classes in 1 patient， which shows that CMAC group had a better glottic opening when compared with that of the Macintosh.\n\n【83】Hemodynamic parameters\n\n【84】Heart rate\n\n【85】There was an increase in heart rate during intubation in all the patients in the three study groups. However， there was a statistically significant (P-value <0.05) (Table no： 11) among the study groups was observed that more increase in Macintosh group 92.32 \\[(S.D±8.04)\\]and C-Mac laryngoscope \\[89.32 (S.D.±5.65)\\] when compared with patients of McCoy laryngoscope\\[87.96 ( S.D±6.53)\\] group. Aggarwal et al 2019(10) showed that there was a significant increase in the mean heart rate of Group C(C-Mac)， 102.60± 9.74 more than Group A(Macintosh)，101.36±8.35 more than Group B (McCoy)， 92.56±11.19.

However， there was statistically significant among the study groups， and it was observed that more increase in Macintosh\\[95.76 (S.D.±10.57) and C-Mac laryngoscope \\[93.12 (S.D±6.69)I when compared with patients of McCoy laryngoscope group \\[90.52 (S.D.±6.73)\\]. Archana et al. in 2019(11) conducted a study titled， C-MAC Video Laryngoscope versus Macintosh Laryngoscope for Intuba-tion in Elective Surgery： A Clinical Trial' in which they compared the hemodynamic changes in both the groups. DBP was noted immediately after intubation in the C-Mac group at 77.06+5.9& in the Macintosh group at 80.9+10.6， which was statistically significant (P<0.05). Aggarwal et al. in 2019(10) showed that there was a significant increase in mean diastolic blood pressure among the study groups with less increase in Group B (McCoy)86.92±7.92 when compared with group A(Macintosh) 93.52±8.33and Group C(C-Mac) 94.52±6.98.\n\n【103】Mean arterial pressure\n\nThere was an increase in mean arterial blood pressure during intubation in all the patients in the three study groups. However， there were statistically significant among the study groups. It was observed that there was more increase in the Macintosh group\\[109.4 (S.D±7.66)|and C-Mac laryngoscope \\[106.6 (S.D±5.91)I when compared with patients of McCoy laryngoscope\\[103.64 (S.D± 6.76)I group. Gaurav et al. in 2016(12) showed that the maximum change in mean arterial pressure was 28.08%in the Macintosh and 15.25% in the McCoy group. This differ-ence between groups was significant (P < 0.0001). Lipika et al. 2016(13) it was concluded that significant increase in mean arterial blood pressure (27%) after laryngoscopy using the Mac-intosh blade (P <0.05). The use of the McCoy blade did not result in any significant change in mean arterial blood pressure. It was concluded that the stress response to laryngoscopy is less marked with the use of the McCoy blade.\n\n【105】Limitation\n\n【106】· One limitation of our study was that we measured blood pressure non-invasively. However， the patients included in our study were relatively healthy ASA I and ASA I patients， so it was not justified to monitor blood pressure in these patients invasively.\n\n【107】TThe muscle relaxation and the degree of relaxation at the time of tracheal intubation， which may affect the response， were not measured.\n\n【108】Conclusion\n\n【109】From the present study， it was concluded that：\n\n【110】· There was a statistically significant increase in hemody namic parameters during laryngoscopy and intubation of patients of all three study groups. However， less increase in hemodynamic responses was observed in patients intu-bated with McCoy laryngoscope compared with patients intubated with Macintosh and C Mac laryngoscope.\n\n【111】拿The C Mac laryngoscope shows better visualization of glot-tis when compared to that of Macintosh， and McCoy can be used for intubation. Hence it can be used among patients with anticipated intubation difficulty.\n\n【112】Funding\n\n【113】This work did not receive any grant from funding agencies in the public， commercial， or not-for-profit sectors.\n\n【114】Conflict of interest\n\n【115】There are no conflicts of interest to declare by any of the authors of this study.\n\n【116】References\n\n【117】1\\.

The common shared clinical feature is the appearance of multiple， pin-point， non-blanching red or purple macules that resemble cayenne pepper spots \\[1，2\\]. As their etiology is unknown， and no clear distinction has been established between the different patterns other than on clinical morphologi-cal grounds， classification remains clinical. Gravity and in-creased venous pressure are important localizing factors in many cases， and exercise may be a provoking factor. Most are chronic， but two-thirds may eventually improve or clear\\[3\\]. Adults are mainly affected， but there are several reports of cases in children \\[4\\].\n\n【23】Unilateral pigmented purpuric dermatosis is a benign self-limiting condition， mainly affecting children. We report a case of unilateral pigmented purpuric dermatosis begin-ning in adulthood.\n\n【24】CASE REPORT\n\n【25】We present the case of a 38-year-old man with asymptomatic purpuric pigmentations developed on the extensor side of the left lower extremity in a linear arrangement 6 months before presentation (Figure 1).\n\n【26】Analytical studies including hemogram， erythrocyte sed-imentation rate， serum chemistry， urinalysis， cryoglobu-lins， and screening for thrombotic and clotting disorders were recorded and test results were all within normal lim-its. Histopathological examination showed focally perivas-cular inflammatory infiltrates， consisting mainly oflympho-cytes and conspicuous extravasation of red blood cells into the papillary dermis. No histological evidence of vasculi-tis was detected.Hemosiderin deposits were more limited than expected in the patient (Figure 2). The case was con-patible with diagnosis of pigmented purpuric dermatosis.\n\n【27】Because unilateral pigmented purpuric dermatosis is a self-limiting condition， the patient did not receive any medica-tion. The purpuric component resolved within 6 months， while pigmentation showed partial resolution at 12-month follow-up.\n\n【28】DISCUSSION\n\n【29】Under the term “pigmented purpuric dermatoses\" may be included several chronic conditions whose etiology is un-known and whose varying morphology has given rise to a be-wildering com plexity of descriptive and eponymous names\\[1，2\\]. Intermediate cases eccur； histologically they are all similar. Extravasation of red blood cells occurs but may be relatively inconspicuous. Hemosiderin deposits are present in macrophages. The superficial small vessels may show nar-rowing of the lumen and endothelial swelling and perivas-cular lymphocytic infiltration； the evidence suggests this is a purely local inflammatory process in the skin. The cellu-lar infiltrate contains Leu-l reactive T-cells and Langerhans’cells \\[5，6\\]. We did not stain the specimen for Leu-1，CDla and CD83 because of the lack of these capabilities at our department.\n\n【30】Figure 1. Unilateral pigmented purpuric dermatosis on the left lower leg.\n\n【31】Figure 2. Histopathological view shows perivascular extravasation of RBCs， admixed with pigment-laden melanophages and some lymphocytes in the papillary dermis，H&E，×100.\n\n【32】Occasionally these patterns may be associated with one of the known etiological factors， and it must be emphasized that making such a morphological diagnosis does not ex-empt the clinician from looking for an etiology. Gravity and increased venous pressure are important localizing fac-tors in many cases， and exercise may be a provoking factor.\n\n【33】The classical eruptions usually present in middle-aged adults as asymptomatic， purpuric macules on the lower extremi-ties； there is usually no significant venous or arterial insuf-ficiency， and hematological parameters are normal. The common shared clinical feature is the appearance of mul-tiple， pinpoint， non-blanching red or purple macules that resemble cayenne pepper spots \\[7\\].\n\n【34】Our case supports previous reports of unilateral pigment-ed purpuric dermatosis being a benign self-limiting condi-tion， but does not agree with the findings of other workers\n\n【35】\\[8\\] reporting that the onset usually manifests in childhood. Our patient was working for the military forces， which rou-tinely have parades. Possibly he engaged in strenuous exer-cise during his work， although he denied any exhaustion. His blood pressure and physical exam results all were with-in normal limits. The pigmented purpuric dermatoses must be distinguished from other disorders that lead to purpura， especially systemic necrotizing vasculitis \\[7\\]. Dysfunctional and inadequate platelets and elevations of prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time may lead to purpura. The cayenne pepper spot is helpful in the differential diag-noses of the pigmented purpuric dermatoses， which must be excluded. Purpuric eruptions have been associated with rheumatoid arthritis \\[9\\]， Hodgkin’s disease， polycythemia\\[10\\]， and diabetes mellitus \\[11\\].\n\n【36】Angioma serpiginosum was included in some of the initial reports of the classic pigmented purpuras \\[12\\]. Minute， red， clustered puncta exist in this disorder without any associat-ed purpura or hemosiderin. This is believed to be a nevoid proliferation of vascular elements with dilated capillaries. Hypergammaglobulinemia may cause purpura of the lower extremities； a normal serum protein value would rule this out \\[13\\]. Other differential diagnoses include Kaposi’s sar-coma， lichen planus， fixed drug eruption， purpuric myco-sis fungoides， and purpura secondary to impaired hemo-stasis \\[14\\].\n\n【37】Acknowledgement\n\n【38】Authors thank the patient for formal permission about pub-lication of his details and photos.\n\n【39】REFERENCES：\n\n【40】1\\.

It usually occurs as a solitary， subcutaneous， and well-circumscribed lesion in the posterior neck， shoulders， and back of older men \\[2\\]. The SCL is rarely found in the oral cav-ity. Histologically， SCL is characterized by replacement of ma-ture fat cells by spindle cells that are closely associated with a mucoid matrix and collagen boundless \\[3，4\\]. Since the first report of an intraoral SCL， 43 new cases have been well docu-mented and only 2 were located on the hard palate \\[5\\]. Here， we present the clinical-pathologic features of a third case of SCL located on the hard palate， and we discuss the histological differential diagnosis with other fusiform neoplasms.\n\n【36】Case Report\n\n【37】A 56-year-old black man with non-contributory medical his-tory was examined for an asymptomatic swelling on the right side of the hard palate. The patient had noticed the lesion 3months prior to the appointment and it further increased in size， preventing him from wearing the prosthesis. No abnor-malities were noticed in the extraoral examination.\n\n【38】The intraoral examination showed a 25x20 mm sessile and cir-cumscribed tumor， underlying an apparently healthy mucosa of normal color (Figure 1). The lesion revealed a floating con-sistency during palpation.\n\n【39】Excisional biopsy was carried out based on a clinical diagnosis of lipoma or a benign minor salivary gland tumor. The histopa-thology demonstrated a well-circumscribed but unencapsulat ed proliferation of bland spindle cells admixed with mature ad-ipocytes in a collagenous/myxoid stroma (Figure 2A， 2B). Mast cells were common (Figure 2B). The spindle cells were uniform， exhibiting elongated nuclei and narrow cytoplasmic process-es without atypia. They were positive to CD34 (Figure 2C) and negative to factor VIII， alpha-smooth muscle actin， S100， cyto-keratin， and actin (Figure 2D). Mitotic activity was low， as con-firmed by Ki-67 immunostaining. No lipoblastic activity was found. The diagnosis of SCL was therefore established. No re-currence was noticed up to 24-month follow-up.\n\n【40】Discussion\n\n【41】SCL is an histological variant of lipoma， usually found in the trunk or neck. SCL of the oral cavity is a rare lesion and until now only 43 cases have been reported \\[5\\]. The tongue is the most commonly affected oral site， followed by the floor of the mouth and bucca. mucosa \\[6-8\\].\n\n【42】Figure 1. Clinical presentation： A 25x20 mm circumscribed swelling on the right side of the hard palate， covered by an apparently healthy mucosa with evident superficial vascularization.\n\n【43】There are only 2 published cases in which SCL was located on the hard palate \\[8，9\\]. Both cases were reported in male pa-tients over the fifth and sixth decades of life， which is com-patible with the present case. All tumors were circumscribed， covered by healthy mucosa， and ranged in size from 20 to 25mm. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 24 months， and no recurrenc-es are expected after local excision (Table 1). In previous re-ports， fibroma， salivary gland neoplasms， classic lipoma，and benign neural tumors were considered as clinical differential diagnosis of tumors located on the hard palate. All these le-sions were included in our diagnostic hypotheses.\n\n【44】SCL is a neoplasm composed by fusiform cells， adipocytes， with a collagenous and occasionally mucinous matrix， presenting a spectrum of variation among these components \\[1，11\\].When floret-like multinucleated cells are found， the SCL is classified as pleomorphic lipoma \\[5\\].\n\n【45】The fusiform component of SCL mimics other spindle cell lesions， demanding special attention in the histopathological differen-tial diagnosis. The most important differentiation is with a well differentiated lipossarcoma (WDL)， and subtle distinctions must be observed： SCL is located superficially in contrast with WDL. Spindle cells in SCL have an orderly appearance， with scarce mitotic figures and without pleomorphism \\[10，11\\]. Lipoblasts， represented by multivacuolated and pleomorphic adipocytes， are absent in SCL， but are a component of WDL \\[1，10，12.The vascularization is also different between these lesions.While WDL exhibits a prominent plexiform capillary pattern， the vas-cular pattern in SCL is usually inconspicuous.\n\n【46】Figure 2.

Neurofibroma is a relatively common lesion in palate， but the fusiform component exhibits a wavy nuclei which is not observed in spindle cells of SCL (Figure 2E). Mast cells are common in both tumors.\n\n【54】There is also an overlap between histologic features of DFS and SCL however， DFS is a cutaneous tumor exceptionally seen in oral tissues \\[13\\]. The fusiform component of DFS diffuse-ly infiltrates skeletal muscle bundles， peripheral nerves， and salivary glands， mimicking its cutaneous counterpart. Indeed， this entrapping feature is the distinguishing characteristic be-tween DFS and other fusiform lesions \\[14\\].\n\n【55】SFT is an uncommon neoplasm within the oral tissues， and it is mostly located in the buccal mucosa \\[15\\]. SFT usually shows circumscription and is encapsulated. It is characterized by a proliferation of spindle cells in a variably vascular and colla-genized stroma. The spindle cells often form whorls around small capillaries in a storiform pattern in hypercellular areas(Figure 2G). In contrast， vascularization is not a prominent\n\n【56】feature in SCL and mature adipocytes are always present. However， entrapped fat cells can also be seen in SFT and mast cells are shown in both neoplasms \\[14，15\\]. Cellularity is vari-able between SCL and SFT； nevertheless， overall cellularity is consistently lower in SCL Collagen characteristics also vary be-tween the neoplasms， but the “ropey\" collagen bundles are seen exclusively in SCL \\[14\\]\n\n【57】The origin of the fusiform component in SCL is uncertain； how-ever， ultrastructural studies have shown that spindle cells are modified fibroblasts that originated from mesenchymal cells located around vessels， which have lost their ability to differen-ciate into lipocytes but are capable of collagen synthesis \\[1，12\\]. These spindle cells show immunoreactivity to CD34，bcl-2\\[16\\] and are negative to， alpha-smooth muscle actin， Factor VIII， cy-tokeratin， and S-100 \\[5，9\\]. The positivity to CD34 can be help-ful in the confirmation of diagnosis \\[17\\]， but the immunohis-tochemical profile alone is not enough to distinguish SCL from other fusiform lesions (Table 2).\n\n【58】WDL rarely shows positivity to CD34； however， other fusiform neoplasms are immunopositive to CD34， such as SFT (Figure 2H)\n\n【59】and DFS. Fusiform cells in SFT may also show positivity for bcl-2 and CD99 (Figure 21). In these situations， the morphological differences should be observed to establish the final diagno sis， although immunohistochemistry can contribute to spe-cific differential diagnosis. For example， bcl-2 is expressed in SCL but is not observed in dermatofibroma， nodular fasciite， or in malignant and benign smooth muscle proliferations \\[5\\]. Although adipocytes in SCL are positive to S-100 (Figure 2D)， the fusiform cells are negative to this antigen， differentiating SCL from neurofibroma (Figure 2F).\n\n【60】References：\n\n【61】1\\.

The stimulus parameters may be related to the outcome， and also to the cognitive changes reported in this treatment. Our objective was to list which factors could be considered as markers of quality of crisis and to verify cognition impairments. Methods： This is a real-world study (not interventionist). Eighteen patients with a depressive episode and treatment-resistant were selected Tests applied before and 15 days after the last session： The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)， Verbal Fluency Test (TFV)， The Quality of Life Satisfaction and Satisfaction Questionnaire(Q-LES-Q-SF). The mood was measured by Hamilton-D-17(HAM-D-17) at five different times Results： There was a consistent decrease in the HAM-D-17 score during the sessions. There was a response in 55.55% and remission in 44.44%and an increase in the Q-LES-Q-SF score demonstrating the therapeutic value of ECT. There were no detectable cognitive changes two weeks after the end of the sessions. Statistical tests have proven that cardiac monitoring added to the monitoring of seizure duration are useful to monitor the quality of seizures. Conclusion： ECT is effective for treating depression and do not cause cognition impairment 15 days after treatment. Simple methods such as heart rate monitoring and duration of central and motor crises are important as a criterion for monitoring the quality of seizures. The study should be replicated in larger samples to ensure that the generalisations of these conclusions are solid.\n\n【4】KEYWORDS electroconvulsive therapy， depression， response predictor， cognition\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】The World Health Organization affirms that more than 300 mil-lion people are affected by major depressive disorder worldwide. It is a disease that， in addition to being very prevalent， is often difficult to treat \\[1\\].

In this scenario， non-pharmacological treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy(ECT) can be considered as therapeutic approaches. For episodes of primary depression， the remission rate can reach 80-90%\\[3\\]， and despite this， some clinicians avoid the indication of this treatment.\n\n【15】Although ECT treatment is efficient， it may cause fear， mainly due to reports of cognitive impairment. Therefore，ECT techniques have undergone constant improvements in recent decades in order to minimize such changes in cognitive func-tions.\n\n【16】It has been demonstrated that the bilateral (or bifrontotem-poral) positioning is discretely more effective than the right uni-lateral stimulation. However， bilateral stimulation also results in more expressive cognitive side effects than right unilateral position \\[4\\].This contrast between both techniques has been rel-ativized once it was proposed to evaluate the difference in the\n\n【17】dispensed charge dose and the time to reassess the changes in cognition \\[5\\].\n\n【18】Prefixed charge dose considering gender and age have lost space for the empirical titration technique， which consists of using low-dose until the minimum charge dose meets the re-quirement to induce seizure \\[6\\]. This may have ensured the use of the lower dose， but there are still considerations regarding the effectiveness of this technique \\[7\\].\n\n【19】It was verified that brief pulses could decrease the adverse cognitive effects， mainly on those occurring during the treat-ment and immediately after its completion， preserving than the efficacy of ECT \\[8\\]. It is necessary to assure patients that the cognitive alterations will be decreased， guaranteeing safety and reliability of ECT. This article aimed to find indicators of the ses-sion quality and evaluate possible cognitive impairments while using the most ECT updated techniques.\n\n【20】Material and Methods\n\n【21】The selection of the participants for the research was done among the patients treated with ECT at Brasilia’s Castro e Santos In-stitute in Brazil's Federal District. This is a prospective study therefore purely observational. Thus， this study intends to ob-serve the ECT in the real scenario； in addition， the physiological markers for treatment response and also the cognition after the treatment were evaluated. An independent interviewer applied scoring scales before， during the treatment period， and after the end of the ECT sessions. The data collection ran from May to December 2018. The research protocol was submitted to the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Brasilia. It has been approved and registered according to the CAAE： 70980116.7.0000.5558. The study included only pa-tients experiencing episodes of depression who did not respond to psychotropic drugs. Patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders were excluded； as well as other conditions.\n\n【22】We considered the repeated measures type from Hamilton-D-17 (HAM-D-17) rating scale to assess mood at various times in the course of treatment. Thus， the scale was applied before the first session， immediately before the fourth， immediately before the seventh， immediately before the tenth， and again two weeks after the end of the treatment. The MoCA scale (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) was applied to evaluate cognition before， and two weeks after the treatment. We also applied a verbal fluency test (TFV) in the phonological modality： verbalization of the highest number of words initiated by the letters F-A-S. This was done before， and two weeks after the treatment.\n\n【23】Similarly (before the first and two weeks after the last ses-sion) we applied the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short for (Q-LES-Q-SF) to evaluate the final re-sponse from the patient’s point of view. The equipment used for electroconvulsive therapy was SPECTRUM 4000 M approved in Brazil's INMETRO and ANVISA (RDCN°185/01). In the bilat-eral ECT was used bifrontotemporal electrode placement and in the unilateral DElia placement. Empirical titration was used for the initial charge dose. Double of the titration intensity was fixed when using bifrontotemporal placement and six times the titration value when using D'Elia placement. For data analysis， the IBM-SPSS-Statistics 23 was used.\n\n【24】Results\n\n【25】Eighteen patients were selected for this study. This sample has a discrete predominance of single men and patients with a long history of illness (Table 1).\n\n【26】A total of 228 sessions were performed (mean 12.66 and a standard deviation of 3.8). In all cases， Succinylcholine was used. The team physicians determined technical variables such as anes-thetic choice and electrode positioning without the interference of the investigator (table 2). The HAM-D-17 scale showed that approximately 44.44% (eight patients) had symptom remission， and 55.55% (10 patients) responded to treatment. We used the Friedman test to study these data： a significant difference (p<0.000) was found between HAM-D-17 values. In the diagram(figure 1)， it was possible to observe a progressive reduction of the scale index between the initial and final measurements\n\n【27】Analyzing Q-LES-Q-SF， we found an essential difference be-tween test 1 (initial) and test 2 (final) and， after the application of T-test， we noticed a significant increase of (p<0.000) in punctua-tion. This increase， on average， was 25 points on the Q-LES-Q-SF indicator scale. Analyzing the Verbal Fluency Test (VFT)， we observed a difference between tests 1 and 2. We verified with the T-test that the VFT score increased significantly after treatment(P-value=0.010). This increase， on average， was of 5 points.On the other hand， the MoCA scale showed no differences between tests 1 and 2 (P-value=0.879). The means of evolution in cog-nition and quality of life tests are summarized below (Figure2).\n\n【28】We studied the correlation between the evolution of HAM-D-17 and the moment of crisis (central， motor and the difference between them). Spearman correlation coefficient was calculated. The correlation between Hamilton evolution and the central cri-sis was significant， but of low intensity (p= 0.002 and correlation coefficient = 0.201). When comparing the difference between the central crisis and the motor crisis with Hamilton's evolution， we noticed a significant and slightly stronger correlation than that observed only with the central crisis (P <0.00 and correlation coefficient = 0.285). We did not find a significant correlation between loading dose， interhemispheric symmetry， suppres-sion intensity and the reduction pattern in the HAM-D-17 score. The number of sessions performed， the gender and the age of the patients did not influence the evolution observed by the HAM-D-17. We noticed a significant relationship between the number of antidepressants taken before ECT and the evolution of HAM-D-17 (P-value=0.013). This relationship is inversely proportional.\n\n【29】Finally， we performed a linear regression model to evaluate the predictors of evolution in HAM-D-17. For the selection of variables， the stepwise technique was performed. However， the model only presented those variables that demonstrated to be significant. The result showed a model with two variables (the difference between the central and motor crises and the heart rate) with an adjusted R square of 0.861. Therefore， this may account for 86% of the Hamilton scale variability.\n\n【30】Discussion\n\n【31】The HAM-D-17 version is often used to assess response to de-pression treatment \\[9\\]. Results showed a consistent reduction in this scaled score， which points to the effectiveness of ECT treatment for symptoms of depression. The response rate was55.55% and remission 44.44%. We should consider that the sam-ple consisted of patients who did not respond to medications， which impacted the response evaluated in the literature\\[10\\]. Contrary to what was traditionally expected about the effect of ECT on cognition， the posttreatment VFT score increased signifi-cantly compared to the value before initiation of treatment. This increase， on average by 5 points on the indicator scale， is statis-\n\n【32】Table 1 Epidemiological characteristics of the selected sample.\n\n【33】Figure 1： Constant regression in mean scores of the Hamilton during treatment.\n\n【34】tically significant (p-value=0.010). We can infer that ECT did not impair semantic storage and its evocation. Similarly， MoCA results showed no worse cognitive performance after ECT. This reinforces the idea that cognitive function remains unchanged after 15 days of ECTcompletion. Besides， Q-LES-Q-SF showed a significant increase in the score (P <0.000). The data suggest that a nine-point increase in Q-LES-Q-SF is sufficient to indicate a change promoted by instituted therapy \\[25\\]. Thus， we found that approximately 83% of patients had a good increase in score.\n\n【35】Constant adjustments can explain the poor correlation be-tween symptom decline and interhemispheric synchrony， as well as postictal volume and suppression during treatment. The electrical charge has been increased whenever any signal indi-cates loss of seizure quality， as well as other adjustments. Thus， the number of asymmetric crises was small， interfering with the statistical analyzes of this small group. Similarly， postictal\n\n| Variable  | Mean (M)， standard deviation (SD)， percentage (%)and number of patients(n)  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Age，yars  | 40，22(M) - 12，37 (SD)  |\n| Sex， male  | 55，6%-10(n)  |\n| Higher education  | 77，7%-14(n)  |\n| Years of illness  | 12 (M)-7，3 (SD)  |\n| Marital Status， single  | 55，6%-10(n)  |\n| 5 or more antidepressants failed  | 94，4%-17(n)  |\n| Bilateral application  | 88，8%-16(n)  |\n| Number of sessions  | 12，66 (M)  |\n\n【37】Table 2 Technical elements such as electrode placement and use of anaesthetics.\n\n| Technical Variable  | Percentage (%) and number of patients(n)  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Electrodes， bilateral  | 88，8%-16(n)  |\n| Electrodes， bilateral and right-unilateral  | 11，1%-2(n)  |\n| Propofol  | 72，2%-13(n)  |\n| Propofol replaced by Etomidate  | 16，6%-3(n)  |\n| Etomidate only  | 11，1%-2(n)  |\n\n【39】Figure 2： Evolution in cognition and quality of life tests.\n\n【40】suppression， despite showing a correlation with regression in the HAM-D-17 score， has no statistical significance.\n\n【41】We demonstrated that the longer the seizure time，the higher the Hamilton evolution. The merits of monitoring the dura-tion of the EEG-based seizure concerning the duration of motor seizure in estimating the efficacy of ECT treatment were demon-strated in several trials \\[11\\]. Historically we know that the im-provement of depression depends on the time of the seizure， although there are still debates and controversies mainly regard-ing the minimum time necessary \\[12\\]. Some studies claim that seizures of less than 15 seconds are associated with lower clinical outcomes \\[13\\]， but there is not any consensus on this yet. The complex electrophysiological conditions involved in the devel-opment of generalized seizures make it problematic that the therapeutic efficacy of ECT is solely linked to the duration of the central seizure \\[14\\]. The American Psychiatric Association\n\n【42】recommends a seizure duration of more than 20 seconds as ideal during ECT administration \\[3\\]. This recommendation， however， was considered with consideration， as many factors influence this variable without changing the outcome of symptoms； For example， some studies with Propofol achieved an average du-ration of fewer than 20 seconds of seizure and the equivalent control result \\[15\\]. Therefore， some researchers criticize the ECT crisis duration guidelines by saying that the values are arbitrary and suggesting that they are too long for treatment \\[16\\]. Regard-less of a consensus cutoff point for central seizure duration， our data show a correlation between symptom improvement and seizure duration. We know that the motor crisis has lost prestige as a response predictor in ECT.\n\n【43】This is a consequence of improved technique. At the begin-ning of ECT stimulation practice， there was only motor monitor-ing，but today EEG monitoring is more important. The motor crisis (tonic-clonic)， however is an obvious sign of the central crisis. We also know that the duration of central seizure is never less than a motor seizure. It was from this point that we pro-posed a new assessment of the motor crisis. We conclude that the higher the time differences between motor and central seizures， the higher the quality of the seizure， regardless of discussions about the minimum effective duration of the central seizure. Assessment of motor seizures in the case of EEG seizures may improve outcome specificity， since EEG-based seizures may oc-cur without motor manifestation， but the opposite is not possible. We hypothesised that after-action potential spread， neural re-serves respond to stimulus differently in the motor cortex and the prefrontal cortex. If effective， physiological measures combat seizure in the motor cortex and subsequently in the prefrontal area， and the time difference between motor and central seizures is reflected in this property. This idea is compatible with the prefrontal theory \\[17\\]， which proposes that the efficacy of ECT is connected to a distribution of electrical current density in the prefrontal cortex， as evidenced by studies showing reduced blood flow and metabolic activity in this area \\[18J.\n\n【44】Our hypothesis is also consistent with anticonvulsant theory. This theory is based mainly on findings that demonstrate an in-crease in the frontal region of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) action after ECT \\[19\\]. Finally， our hypothesis also finds support in the hypothesis of hyperconnectivity in depression， which in-dicates that symptoms of depression are associated with rigid dysfunctional circuits \\[20\\]. Data show that overall mean func-tional connectivity decreased considerably after ECT treatment， which was related to the improvement of depressive symptoms211.\n\n【45】All these theories claim that ECT can make the body react to electrical stimulation by fighting artificially triggered disorgani-zation， restoring broken equilibrium. Consequently， there is a neurochemical reorganization that suppresses the symptoms of depression. We infer that the difference between central and mo-tor crises may reflect the effectiveness of this prefrontal activity and， therefore， can be considered a predictor of ECT response to depression. This would give us a new parameter that is inde-pendent of simple isolated temporal measurement of seizures and offers clinicians new insight to qualify sessions as good or not. We also found out a significant relationship between the maximum heart rate and the response to ECT treatment. This measure is important because it represents an autonomic manifestation that helps prove that a given stimulus was able to promote a generalized crisis. This is because the electrical stimulus will cause a sympathetic response marked by the accel-\n\n【46】eration of heart rate shortly after the crisis becomes generalized\\[22\\]. There is still a bottleneck in determining a heart rate value that can be considered a good response marker. Minelli \\[23\\] con-sidered 120 BPM as the cut-off value in his research， but some authors bet on a higher value. It is also necessary to consider the influence of atropine use on cardiac response. While discussing a specific value for determining the cutoff point， the correla-tion between cardiac acceleration and generalized seizures is a consensus. So we prefer to document the correlation without establishing a cutoff point that may be questionable.\n\n【47】Thus， we found in our sample a significant relationship (P<0.00). Higher heart rates are related to better scores on the de-pression scale. The usefulness of this record in qualified crises is relevant. Changes in heart rate during ECT indicate deeper brain seizure activity than usually shown by electroencephalography and recording of motor activity \\[24\\]. Also， the simplicity of monitoring this information emphasizes its indispensability in electroconvulsive therapy routines. The two main elements that explain the Hamilton scale score variability were heart rate and the time difference between motor and central seizures. In the linear regression statistical model， the sum of these two parame-ters can explain 86% of the variability of Hamilton evolution.\n\n【48】Finally， we must consider that the reduced sample inter-fered with some analyzes. Few patients are undergoing ECT in Brasilia， as we did not have this treatment available until a short time ago. We also pointed out that factors such as cost of treatment and prejudice against ECT helped to limit the sample.\n\n【49】This reality may explain some biases in the sample as a high educational level， which differs from the average educational level in Brazil. Higher education may be related to access to information and，therefore， with less prejudice against ECT.\n\n【50】Conclusion\n\n【51】Current ECT techniques do not impair cognition 15 days after the end of sessions. There was no difference in the MoCA scale， while there was an improvement in VFT performance and a significant improvement in patients' quality of life. These data help to prove that ECT is an effective and safe method. Besides， we have also proposed a new way of looking at motor and cen-tral seizure monitoring added to heart rate monitoring during ECT. This helps to show that simple methods are essential as criteria for monitoring the quality of crises. The study should be replicated in larger samples to ensure that the generalizations of these conclusions are sound.\n\n【52】Disclosure Statement\n\n【53】There were no financial support or relationships between the authors and any organization or professional bodies that could pose any conflict of interests.\n\n【54】Competing Interests\n\n【55】Written informed consent obtained from the patient for publica-tion of this case report and any accompanying images.\n\n【56】References\n\n【57】1\\.

This may lead to delayed or missed diagnosis of splenic rupture， which may be life threat-ening \\[1\\]. It is an important and life threatening complication of Plasmodium vivax infection， but is rarely seen in Plasmodium falciparum malaria \\[2-4\\]. Very few case reports are available in the literature documenting spontaneous rupture of malari-al spleen \\[5-9\\]. We are reporting a patient encountered in our department with P.falciparum malaria who developed a spon-taneous splenic rupture.\n\n【22】Case Report\n\n【23】This 29-year-old male patient had a history of high grade in-termittent fever with chills for 4 days followed by disorienta-tion and reduced urine output and abdominal pain with dis-tension associated with bilateral hip pain and dyspnea with bilateral chest pain (mainly on the left side) for 1 day. There was no history of trauma or abnormal bleeding. On admis-sion， he was febrile， appeared to be toxic， dehydrated， and pale and was disoriented. His extremities were cold and his pulse rate was 122/min. His abdomen was distended with diffuse tenderness mainly over the left hypochondrium， with hepato-splenomegaly. There was also bilateral diminished air entry. The hemoglobin level was 7.2 g% and peripheral smear showed P. falciparum species. Chest X-ray showing marked bilateral hemothorax on the left side， so left intercostal chest tube was inserted. Sonography of the abdomen revealed a splenic hematoma and enlarged spleen and liver with free flu-id in the abdomen. Pelvic-abdominal CT showed a large peri-splenic hematoma with multiple splenic lacerations (Figures 1and 2). MRI pelvis showed bilateral hemoarthrosis in both hip joints (mainly on the left side) (Figure 3). The patient was tak-en for emergency laparotomy after receiving a transfusion of4 units of whole blood. Laparotomy confirmed hemoperitone-um (Figure 4)， with about 1.5 L of blood-stained fluid，enlarged friable spleen with rupture of the splenic capsule on the inner surface， and active bleeding (Figures 5 and 6). Intra-operatively， the spleen was found to be enlarged and friable， with both poles lacerated and multiple bleeding points. A splenectomy was performed. The patient received antimalarial therapy post-operatively. Histopathology of the specimen showed malarial pigments in macrophages and congested red pulp， thus con-firming the diagnosis of malarial spleen.\n\n【24】Discussion\n\n【25】The present case presented to us on the sixth day after onset of fever. Although the patient showed initial clinical improvement\n\n【26】Figure 1. Enhanced CT scan of the abdomen (transverse) shows the ruptured spleen (arrow) and the perisplenic hematoma (arrowheads).\n\n【27】Figure 2. MRI pelviswas showing bilateral hip joints hemoarthrosis \\[mainly on left side).\n\n【28】following antimalarial therapy， the sudden onset of diffuse acute abdominal pain in the absence of any trauma was un-expected and its cause could not be ascertained. Splenic rup-ture with hemoperitoneum was only confirmed during the subsequent emergency laparotomy. Spontaneous rupture of the spleen is an uncommon condition. The causes include in-fectious， neoplastic， and hematological diseases. Only an esti-mated 2% of falciparum malaria cases present with spontane-ous splenic rupture\\[1\\]. The first case of spontaneous rupture of the spleen was reported by Atkinson， an English surgeon， in 1874 \\[10\\]. A peculiar aspect of this complication is that it\n\n【29】Figure 3. Emergency laparotomy. Photograph demonstrating hemoperitoneum during the surgery.\n\n【30】Figure 4. Emergency laparotomy. Photograph demonstrating enlarged， friable with lacerated both poles and multiple bleeding points during the surgery.\n\n【31】can occur in patients on antimalarial prophylaxis and treat-ment \\[11\\]. Although the exact mechanism of splenic rupture in malaria is still not clear， the following mechanisms have been suggested \\[12，13\\]：() cellular hyperplasia and congestion leading to increase in intrasplenic tension； (ii) splenic compres-sion by increased intra-abdominal pressure during activities like sneezing， coughing and defecation； and (iii) reticuloendo-thelial hyperplasia resulting in venous congestion， thrombo-sis， and infarction，which cause sub-capsular hemorrhage and\n\n【32】Figure 5.

A few diagnostic cri-teria for labeling a case as spontaneous rupture have been rec-ommended by Orloff and Peskin \\[14\\]：() absence of any histo-ry of trauma； (ii) absence of any pre-existing splenic disease；(ii) absence of adhesions or scarring in the spleen； and (iv) presence of grossly normal spleen. To detect this complication early， a high index of clinical suspicion is required， along with\n\n【35】abdominal ultrasonography or contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen. Clinically， left hypochondrial pain occurring dur-ing or following treatment of malaria is the commonest pre-sentation of splenic rupture in malaria \\[15\\]. Our case present-ed with left hypochondrial pain but no history of trauma could be elicited. The trigger was probably violent movements by the patient due to the cerebral malaria.\n\n【36】References：\n\n【37】1\\. ChoudhuryJ， Uttam KG，Mukhopadhyay M： Spontaneous rupture of malar-ial spleen.

This report is of a rare case of left posterior fascicular ventricular tachycardia of Belhassen type detected in a neonate by ‘smart sock' cardiac monitoring.\n\n【27】Case Report：\n\n【28】A premature baby boy at 37 weeks gestational age was discharged home after three days without complica-tion， and was given 'smart socks’ to wear. He was followed up daily for the management of hyperbilirubine-mia， which was treated in the outpatient clinic with a phototherapy blanket. He was admitted to the emer-gency room (ER) at 6 days of age because his 'smart socks'identified a tachycardia of between 180-200 bpm. His parents reported no fever， cough， nasal congestion， or emesis. On examination in the ER， he was alert with no distress. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a sustained monomorphic and wide QRS tachycardia with a heart rate of 200 bpm， right bundle branch block (RBBB)， and a superior axis that was compatible with a di-agnosis of left posterior fascicular ventricular tachycardia of Belhassen type. The echocardiogram showed a structurally normal heart with normal cardiac function. His tachycardia spontaneously converted to normal si-nus rhythm after four hours. He was discharged home three days later without further episodes of tachycar-dia. Cardiac monitoring using smart socks’ continued at home， and no further arrhythmias were detected at one year of age.\n\n【29】Conclusions：\n\n【30】The home use of smartphone-enabled technology to monitor the neonatal and infant cardiac heart rate can identify asymptomatic arrhythmias.\n\n【31】MeSH Keywords： Clinical Alarms · Infant， Newborn· Tachycardia， Ventricular\n\n【32】Ful-text PDE https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/921092\n\n【33】Wearable smartphone-enabled cardiac monitoring devices can aid the diagnosis of asymptomatic tachycardia in neonates and infants and do not require a medical prescription. The Owlet@'smart sock' (Owlet Baby Care， Liss， Hampshire， UK) uses pulse oximetry technology to track the heart rate and oxygen levels of infants and sends information on these measurements to the smartphone of the mother and father via its application(App) when the heart rate or oxygen levels vary from pre-set values. This 'smart sock’ is currently not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a diagnostic medical device. This report is of a rare case of left posterior fascicular ventricular tachycardia of Belhassen type detected in a neo-nate by 'smart sock' cardiac monitoring.\n\n【34】Case Report\n\n【35】A baby boy was born prematurely at 37 weeks gestational age(birth weight， 3，170 gm) by Cesarean section due to breech presentation and premature rupture of membranes. He was discharged home after three days without complication and was followed up daily in the office of his pediatrician for the management of hyperbilirubinemia， which was treated using a phototherapy blanket. His father had bought Owlet@smart socks (Owlet Baby Care， Liss， Hampshire， UK) which were used at home (Figure 1)\n\n【36】He was admitted to the emergency room (ER) at 6 days of age because his 'smart socks' identified a tachycardia of between180-200 bpm. His parents reported no fever， cough， nasal con-gestion， or emesis. On examination in the ER， he was alert with no distress. His temperature was 97.8°F (36.6℃)， pulse rate198 bpm， respiration rate 42/min， blood pressure 69/42 mmHg， and his pulse oximetry was 100%. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a sustained monomorphic and wide QRS (0.11 sec) tachycardia with a heart rate of 200 bpm， right bundle branch block (RBBB)， and a superior axis without a discernible P-wave(Figure 2A)， which was compatible with a diagnosis of left pos-terior fascicular ventricular tachycardia (VT) of Belhassen type. The echocardiogram showed a structurally normal heart with a patent foramen ovale normal cardiac function.\n\n【37】He was breastfed and was latching on frequently， which indi-cated possible dehydration. Laboratory investigations showed a glucose level of 47 mg/dL， and a repeat glucose level of36 mg/dL. He was given a bolus of intravenous dextrose 10%in water (D10W)， which resulted in an improvement of the glu-cose value to 140 mg/dL. His total bilirubin was 16.8 mg/dL， his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was 9 mg/dl， his serum creatinine was0.28 mg/dL， and his sodium was slightly elevated at 148 mmol/L\n\n【38】His tachycardia spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm after four hours (Figure 2B). He was started on pro-pranolol 2 mg/kg/day (tid). Telemetry monitoring showed that he was in sinus rhythm with a heart rate that ranged between7-130 bpm without any cardiac arrhythmia.\n\n【39】Figure 1. A rare case of left posterior fascicular ventricular tachycardia of Belhassen type detected in a neonate by 'smart sock’cardiac monitoring. The Owlet@ 'smart sock' is shown on the left foot of the neonate (A). It is connected to the base station using Bluetooth technology to track the heart rate (without the use of an ECG)， and oxygen levels are mea-sured using pulse oximetry technology (B). A camera can be added to provide additional video and audio monitoring. The information is sent to the smartphone with an App in real-time through the base station (B).\n\n【40】Figure 2. A rare case of left posterior fascicular ventricular tachycardia of Belhassen type detected in a neonate by 'smart sock’cardiac monitoring. (A) The electrocardiogram (ECG) on arrival in the emergency room (ER) shows a wide QRS tachy-cardia， a heart rate of 200 bpm， a QRS interval of 0.11 seconds with right bundle branch block (RBBB). The QRS axis is 255 (superior axis)， the QTc is 0.438， and there is no discernible P-wave. (B) The ECG following spontaneous cardio-version version shows normal sinus rhythm， a heart rate of 137 bpm， PR interval 0.14 sec， a QRS interval of 0.07 sec-onds， a QRS axis of 130， and the QTc is 0.489 (a prolonged QTc).\n\n【41】Because there was a concern that his mother's breast milk was not sufficient and resulted in his hypoglycemia and hyperbil-irubinemia， he was given formula milk as a supplement dur-ing his hospital stay， with 45 mL every three hours of a com-bination of breast milk and infant formula. The glucose and bilirubin levels returned to normal， and he was discharged home three days later. Propranolol was discontinued when he was one month of age. Cardiac monitoring using 'smart socks'continued at home， and no further arrhythmias were detect-ed at one year of age.\n\n【42】This report demonstrated the diagnostic role of the 'smart sock’wearable smartphone-enabled cardiac monitoring device in a newborn baby and identified an unusually high heart rate at six days old. Admission to hospital following tachycardia that was identified by the parents at home resulted in the diagno-sis of the rare condition of left posterior fascicular ventricular tachycardia (VT) of Belhassen type before the neonate devel-oped any cardiac symptom.\n\n【43】Belhassen VT is characterized by a wide QRS tachycardia with right bundle branch block (RBBB) with a superior axis， either with VA conduction or dissociation \\[1\\]. This type of tachycar-dia originates from the left posterior fascicle and occurs most commonly in children and young adults who have a structur-ally normal heart \\[2-4\\]. Belhassen VT rarely occurs in neo-nates or infants \\[2-4\\]. It is usually refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic therapy， such as beta-blockers， but is very sensitive to verapamil treatment. However， because the use of intravenous verapamil in infants can cause severe hypo-tension \\[5\\]， the judicious use of verapamil at an intravenous dose of 0.05-0.1 mg/kg over at least 10 minutes is needed for cardioversion of acute tachycardia， with calcium available at the bedside \\[4\\].\n\n【44】In this case， VT spontaneously cardioverted in a few hours without any intervention. Although there was no initial reason to use the 'smart sock’ in this case， had home-based neonatal heart rate monitoring not been done in this case， the episode of this rare form of VT in the neonate at six days old， would not have detected. Although there was no recurrence of VT at one year of age， long term follow-up is recommended in this case.\n\n【45】References：\n\n【46】1\\.

Dalbavancin is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and has a sufficiently promising pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile to be considered for the treatment of vertebral osteomyelitis. We describe here what is probably the first reported case of using multiple weekly dalbavancin to treat a complicated methicillin-resistant Staphyiococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia and verte-bral osteomyelitis.\n\n【22】Case Report：\n\n【23】A 58-year-old man with a long history of recurrent MRSA bacteremia， who failed multiple courses of vanco-mycin and daptomycin， presented with recurrent MRSA bacteremia complicated by diskitis and osteomyeli-tis of the lumbar vertebrae. The patient was treated with dalbavancin 1000 mg intravenously weekly for two weeks followed by 500 mg weekly for six additional weeks. He improved clinically， his back pain resolved， and C-reactive protein (CRP) decreased to normal. Three months after the last dose of dalbavancin therapy， he un-derwent angiography for peripheral artery diseases， after which he developed a fever， mild leukocytosis， an el-evated CRP， and the repeat blood cultures were positive for MRSA. No apparent adverse events were observed during dalbavancin therapy\n\n【24】Conclusions：\n\n【25】In this case， multiple weekly dalbavancin infusions appeared to be safe in the treatment of vertebral osteo-myelitis caused by MRSA， but did not seem to prevent infection recurrence. However， reinfection with a new strain from the angiography catheter insertion is highly likely. Clinical studies are needed to further assess the safety and effectiveness of multiple week ly dalbavancin dosing in the management of vertebral osteomyelitis.\n\n【26】MeSH Keywords： Discitis·Glycopeptides· Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus·Osteomyelitis\n\n【27】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/905930\n\n【28】目名122321 出E1- 目日118\n\n【29】Native vertebral osteomyelitis (NVO) is a common form of he matogenous osteomyelitis， with a higher risk seen in adults aged 50 years or older \\[1\\]. The overall incidence of NVO has been reported at 2.4 per 100，000； however， the incidence in-creases to 6.5 per 100，000 among persons older than 70 years\n\n【30】of age \\[2\\]. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the most fre-\n\n【31】quently isolated organism in vertebral osteomyelitis \\[3-5\\]. Additionally， relapse has been previously reported at 14%\\[5\\]. The most common primary sources of infection for hematoge-nous NVO include the urinary tract， skin and soft tissue， intrave-nous access， genitourinary tract instrumentation， endocarditis， and bursitis or septic arthritis \\[3，5\\]. Lumbar osteomyelitis ac-counts for the majority of vertebral osteomyelitis cases (58%)， followed by thoracic (30%) and cervical (11%) \\[6\\].\n\n【32】Clinical， laboratory， radiologic， and microbiologic findings should be considered in the diagnosis of vertebral osteomyelitis. Back pain， the most common symptom attributable to vertebral os-teomyelitis， was reported in 86% of all cases \\[6\\]. Fever and leu-kocytosis are common and have been reported in up to 45%and 60% of all cases， respectively \\[7\\]. Erythrocyte sedimenta-tion rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are commonly used adjunctively with clinical， imaging， and microbiologic findings to diagnose vertebral osteomyelitis. Elevated ESR or CRP in pa-tients with back pain has a sensitivity that can range from 94%to 100% for vertebral osteomyelitis \\[7\\]. ESR and CRP are also used to monitor clinical response to antimicrobial treatment. Blood cultures yielded growth in only 58% of cases； howev-er， image-guided aspiration biopsy or an open biopsy yielded the organism more often， with a sensitivity of about 77% \\[4\\]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine has a diagnos-tic sensitivity of 97%， and specificity of 93%， and should be used when feasible in patients with suspected vertebral os-teomyelitis； however， computed tomography (CT) scanning is also useful \\[7-9\\]. Image-guided aspiration biopsy is not neces-sary to confirm the diagnosis of NVO in patients with positive blood culture for S. aureus who have clinical， laboratory， and radiologic findings consistent with this disease \\[7\\].\n\n【33】Parenteral antimicrobial therapy for a total duration of 6 weeks is the standard treatment approach for the management of NVO caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA) \\[7\\].Intravenous vancomycin is the primary treatment option， and daptomycin is an alternative agent \\[7\\]. Despite the paucity of clinical data， other options， such as linezolid and ceftaroline， may be considered as salvage therapy in selected patients. However， drug allergy， adverse reactions， antimicro-bial resistance， infection relapse， and clinical or microbiolog-ical failure may further limit the treatment options for verte-bral MRSA infections.\n\n【34】Dalbavancin， a long-acting glycopeptide， is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) caused by susceptible strains of Gram-positive microorgan-isms \\[10\\]. The dose of dalbavancin is 1000 mg given intrave nously over 30 min followed by 500 mg one week later， or as a single dose of 1500 mg \\[10\\]. The long half-life， infrequent dosing， activity against MRSA， favorable safety profile， and high bone concentration in animal and phase I clinical stud-ies， make dalbavancin a promising agent in the treatment of vertebral osteomyelitis \\[11，12\\]. To the best of our knowledge， this article is the first to report on the use of multiple week-ly dalbavancin to treat a complicated MRSA bacteremia and vertebral osteomyelitis.\n\n【35】Case Report\n\n【36】A 58-year-old man with a history of penicillin-induced anaphy-laxis and a long history of recurrent MRSA bacteremia present-ed with another recurrence. His past medical history was signif-icant for congestive heart failure， insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus， diabetic neuropathy，chronic ulceration complicated by osteomyelitis of the right foot， hypertension， depression， pe-ripheral artery disease， acute kidney injury， chronic kidney dis-ease and pulmonary embolism. Past surgical history included trans-metatarsal amputation of the right foot followed by be-low-knee amputation. He recently stopped smoking cigarettes after 40 years and denied alcohol use. The patient has a sig-nificant family history of diabetes mellitus. Home medications included gabapentin， atorvastatin， sertraline， apixaban，losar-tan， furosemide， carvedilol， aspirin， pantoprazole， and insulin.\n\n【37】Originally， the patient developed a persistent MRSA bactere-mia from a chronic right foot ulcer complicated by osteomy-elitis and gangrene. At that time， he underwent a below-knee amputation. A transesophageal echocardiogram showed no evidence of endocarditis. He was initially treated with vanco-mycin 1.25 g intravenously every 12 h， and the trough serum vancomycin concentrations were maintained at 15-20 pg/ml； however， despite vancomycin therapy， his bacteremia per-sisted. Vancomycin was then changed to daptomycin 700 mg intravenously daily. The minimum inhibitory concentrations(MICs) of vancomycin， daptomycin， and linezolid were 1， 0.5and 4 ug/ml， respectively. He completed a 6-week course of intravenous antibiotics and initially cleared his bacteremia.\n\n【38】Three weeks later， he was readmitted with wound dehiscence of the amputation site， recurrent MRSA bacteremia， and pyo-genic arthritis of the left knee and left shoulder. He was treat-ed with a 6-week course of intravenous vancomycin， which led to a complete resolution of his left knee， left shoulder， and right leg infections. For this isolate， the MICs of vancomycin，\n\n【39】daptomycin and linezolid were 2， 1 and 4 ug/ml， respective-ly. He was again noted to have recurrent MRSA bacteremia and was again treated with a long course of vancomycin. His intravenous catheter was removed at the end of treatment.\n\nIn this current admission， he presented to the emergency de-partment with severe back pain. Body Temperature was 98.6°F(37C)， heart rate was 88 beats min-1， respiratory rate was 18breaths min-， and blood pressure was 143/83 mmHg. His weight was 70 kg and height was 5 feet 11 inches. On phys-ical examination， he had no cardiorespiratory distress. Heart sounds 1 and 2 were regular， and he had a 2/6 systolic mur-mur. He had vesicular breath sounds with basal crackles. He had suprapubic and left flank tenderness. He was alert and oriented to time， place， and person and had no focal deficit. Abnormal laboratory findings included white blood cells (WBCs)12.6×109|-1， serum creatinine 1.3 mg/dl， and CRP 5.0 mg/dl. A lumbar CT scan showed L1 and L2 vertebral endplate destruc-tion that appeared to be recent， suggesting diskitis and osteo-myelitis. Two sets of aerobic blood cultures were drawn and grew MRSA with MICs of 2 pg/m. for both daptomycin and van-comycin， as well as an MIC of 4 pg/ml for linezolid. The isolate was reported sensitive to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole， tet-racycline， and rifampin. Vancomycin was initiated because in-patient dalbavancin was initially unavailable.\n\n【41】A repeat transesophageal echocardiogram showed no evidence of endocardial vegetation. Following blood stream clearance， vancomycin was switched to dalbavancin 1000 mg intrave-nously weekly for 2 weeks， followed by 500 mg weekly for6 additional weeks and rifampin 600 mg po daily. Complete blood count， comprehensive metabolic panel， and CRP were performed weekly. While on therapy， the patient reported feel-ing better， and the back pain subsided. The weekly reading of CRP from the baseline of 5.0 mg/dl trended down to 2.2， 0.9，0.8，0.5， and <0.3 mg/dl and WBCs were within normal limit. The range of blood urea nitrogen was 17-38 mg/dl， serum cre-atinine was 1.26-2.51 mg/dl， and the transaminases remained normal during the treatment. Blood culture continued to be negative at the follow-up visit 14 days after the last dose of dalbavancin. He did not complain of nausea， vomiting， diarrhea， headache， rash， pruritus， or other complaints during therapy.\n\n【42】Three months after the last dose of dalbavancin therapy，the patient underwent angiography for peripheral artery diseas-es， after which he developed a fever， mild leukocytosis， an el-evated CRP， and the repeat blood cultures were again posi-tive for MRSA possibly due to reinfection with a new strain of MRSA acquired during angiography. For this isolate， the MICs of vancomycin， daptomycin and linezolid were 1，0.5 and2 pg/ml，respectively.\n\n【43】Vancomycin and daptomycin are the most commonly used an-tibiotics for the treatment of vertebral osteomyelitis caused by MRSA. However， drug allergy， adverse reactions， antimi-crobial resistance， infection relapse， and clinical or microbi-ological failure can limit their use. Recurrence after the end of treatment has been defined as a new positive blood cul-ture within 3 months after the first positive result \\[13\\]. In this case， due to multiple relapses and the use of salvage thera-py， we were following the patient for 3 months after the last dose of dalbavancin.\n\n【44】Dalbavancin， a novel lipoglycopeptide， is FDA-approved for the treatment of ABSSSl caused by susceptible strains of Gram-positive microorganisms \\[10\\]. It requires infrequent dosing due to its prolonged terminal half-life of 14.4 days \\[12\\]. In addition， it has potent activity against MRSA， with MIC，， of 0.06 ug/ml， resulting in 8-fold and 16-fold more activity compared to dapto-mycin (MIC，， of 0.5 ug/ml) and vancomycin (MIC of 1 pg/ml)， respectively \\[14\\]. Furthermore， it has favorable safety profile， with no apparent drug accumulation after a 1000 mg loading dose followed by 500 mg for 7 additional weekly doses \\[12\\]. Moreover， dalbavancin has high bone concentrations in ani-mal and phase I clinical studies with a mean non-infected cor-tical bone to plasma penetration ratio of 13%， which is higher than the mean ratio of 7% previously reported for vancomy-cin \\[11，12，15\\]. These are promising factors to be considered in the treatment of osteomyelitis caused by S. aureus.\n\n【45】Two phase I studies were conducted in healthy volunteers to evaluate the safety， tolerability， and pharmacokinetics of dal-bavancin in bone and articu lar tissue aiming to design a dosing regimen appropriate for long-term use \\[12\\]. The first trial was a bone penetration study. Thirty healthy adults were enrolled and divided into 6 cohorts with 5 subjects each， and received single doses of dalbavancin 1000 mg intravenously over 30 min at 0.5， 1， 3，7， 10， or 14 days before their scheduled elective or-thopedic surgeries. Bone (ug/g) to plasma (ug/ml) concentra-tion ratios were 6.3/85.3 and 4.1/15.3 after 12 h and 14 days， respectively. The mean bone to plasma area under the curve(AUC) penetration ratio was 13.1%. No serious adverse event or adverse event necessitating drug discontinuation or subject withdrawal occurred in the study. In the second trial， 18 sub-jects were enrolled and divided into 3 cohorts with 6 subjects each to assess the safety， tolerability， and pharmacokinetics of dalbavancin following 4 weekly doses (cohort l)， 6 weekly dos-es (cohort II)， and 8 weekly doses (cohortI). All subjects re-ceived 1000 mg of dalbavancin on day 1 followed by 500 mg weekly for the subsequent weekly doses. Blood samples were obtained 15 min before the next weekly scheduled dose. The range of the minimum serum concentrations (Cmin) on days8， 15， and 22 for cohort I was 33.0-31.9 ug/ml； the range on\n\n【46】days 8， 15， 22， 29， and 36 for cohort ll was 38.1-43.2 ug/ml； and the range on days 8， 15， 22， 29， 36， 43， and 50 for cohort Ill was 36.5-40.6 pg/ml. For all 3 cohorts， Cmin were consistent with steady-state concentrations achieved by day 8， and no apparent drug accumulation was observed. Among all subjects in this study， two adverse events were possibly related to drug therapy， transient urticarial rash， and mild pain in the forearm.\n\n【47】Dalbavancin antimicrobial activity appears to correlate well with PK/PD parameters 24-h AUC/MIC and maximum serum con-centration (Cmax)/MIC \\[16\\]. The two regimens， with 1500 mg given on day l and day 8， as well as 1000 mg followed by500 mg weekly for 4 weeks， are expected to achieve similar to-tal AUC； however， experimental data suggest that the efficacy of drugs with long half-life is increased when higher doses are given earlier during the course of treatment \\[12\\]. In this case， due to recurrent MRSA bacteremia， drug resistance， and the presence of a significant penicillin allergy， dalbavancin ther-apy was selected to attempt microbiologic and clinical cure， as well as to prevent relapse. Ceftaroline was not considered due to the allergy status. Linezolid， despite being a bacterio-static agent， can achieve adequate bone concentration that exceeds the MICs of most Gram-positive cocci and has shown successful outcomes in orthopedic infections in case reports and case series \\[17\\]. However， bone marrow suppression， pe-ripheral neuropathy， and optic neuritis are more common in prolonged duration of therapy， which may limit the role of li-nezolid in the treatment of osteomyelitis.\n\n【48】In this case， at the end of dalbavancin therapy， the patient clin-ically improved， his back pain subsided， WBCs remained with-in normal limits， and CRP became normal.

However， 3 months after the last dose of dalbavancin therapy，the patient developed a recurrence.\n\n【58】Recurrence is classified as relapse (same original infect-ing strain) or reinfection (different strain of same species). Reinfection usually occurs later after the completion of thera-py. In one study， relapse of S. aureus bacteremia occurred af-ter a median of 36 days following the completion of antibiotic therapy versus 99 days for reinfection \\[18\\]. Although molecu-lar typing techniques， such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis， are preferred to distinguish relapse from reinfection by com-paring the genetic pattern unique to each strain， phenotyp-ic tests may be used as a helpful tool by differentiating the sensitivity pattern of the isolates. Given the late recurrence， different MICs of the last isolate， and the angiography cathe-ter insertion that preceded the infection in a chronically colo-nized patient， it is highly likely that the recurrence in this case was not a relapse， but rather a reinfection with a new strain of MRSA from a new portal of entry.\n\n【59】Conclusions\n\n【60】In this case， multiple weekly dalbavancin infusions appeared to be safe in the treatment of vertebral osteomyelitis caused by MRSA， but did not seem to prevent infection recurrence. However， reinfection with a new strain from the angiography catheter insertion is highly likely. Clinical studies are need-ed to further assess the safety and effectiveness of multi-ple weekly dalbavancin dosing in the management of verte-bral osteomyelitis.\n\n【61】Conflict of interest\n\n【62】None.\n\n【63】7\\.

Delayed perforation， defined as perforation occurring more than 1 month after implantation， is more uncommon \\[3\\]. In this report， we present a case of cardiac perforation involving the right ventricle (RV) wall that occurred 9 years after pacemaker implantation.\n\n【29】Case Report\n\n【30】A 79-year-old woman presented with symptoms of dyspnea and was subsequently admitted to a hospital. She had undergone pacemaker implantation (a tined J-shaped atrial lead，Medtronic4574-45 cm； a tined ventricular lead， Medtronic 4074-52cm； generator， Medtronic Advisa MRI A3DR01； Medtronic， Minneapolis， MN) for a complete atrioventricular block 9 years prior to the presentation. Her past medical history included diabetes mellitus requiring insulin therapy， chronic subdural hematoma， and bronchial asthma.\n\n【31】An electrocardiogram revealed a heart rate of 32 bpm with a complete atrioventricular block， demonstrating right ventricu-lar failure to capture despite increases of the pacemaker out-put or pulse width. Impedance remained unchanged from the previous check， and computed tomography (CT) imaging in-dicated no obvious lead perforation or pericardial effusion. A temporary pacing lead was inserted through the right jugular\n\n【32】vein to the RV， and another permanent pacing lead insertion was scheduled. Three days later， the patient reported pinpoint chest pain in the left sixth intercostal space， and CT imaging revealed that the pre-existing RV lead had clearly protruded outside the heart， yet with no pericardial effusion. The patient was then transferred to our hospital for surgical intervention. She was afebrile； her vital signs were stable with a ventricu-larly paced rhythm， and chest pain was well-controlled with analgesia. Laboratory results were largely within the expected range， except for a slightly elevated C-reactive protein level of\n\n【33】Figure 2. Computed tomography showing the RV pacing lead penetrated the RV apex and reached the left sixth rib (arrow). No pericardial effusion was detected. RV - right ventricle.\n\n【34】Figure 3. Device interrogation revealed a sudden increase (blue arrow) preceded by a gradual decrease (red arrow) in the RV pacing threshold， over the course of 2 months. RV- right ventricle.\n\n【35】Figure 4. Intraoperative findings. (A) The RV lead protruded approximately 3 cm from the RV apex (arrow). (B) The perforated site was repaired using a 4-0 polypropylene thread with felt pledget.\n\n【36】5.44 mg/dL. A chest radiography revealed that the ventricular lead had advanced forward， when compared to its position 2months prior (Figure 1). A CT scan performed at our hospi-tal suggested that the RV pacing lead had penetrated the RV apex and reached the left sixth rib. No pericardial effusion was detected (Figure 2). Transthoracic echocardiography revealed\n\n【37】normal cardiac function. As the patient had double-coronary vessel disease at the time of the first pacemaker implantation， we performed coronary angiography， which indicated the pro-gression to triple-vessel disease. Device interrogation revealed a sudden increase followed by a gradual decrease in the RV pacing threshold over 2 months (Figure 3).\n\n【38】Differential diagnosis for the causative factors of delayed per-foration of the RV pacemaker lead included the potential pres-ence of infection， myocardial ischemia， cardiomyopathy， trau-ma， and an idiopathic origin.\n\n【39】On the third day after admission， surgery was performed for removal and implantation of the RV lead and coronary artery bypass grafting. A median sternotomy was performed to ex-pose the heart， revealing a minimal serous， non-bloody effu-sion in the pericardial sac. The RV lead protruded approximate-ly 3 cm from the RV apex (Figure 4). There were no findings of infection or adhesion in the pericardium or on the surface of the heart. We disconnected the RV lead from the genera-tor and withdrew it， without any resistance， via the protruding portion of the RV. A biopsy sample of the myocardium at the RV perforation site was harvested， and the defect was closed using a 4-0 polypropylene thread with felt pledget. Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting was subsequently performed to the left anterior descending artery with the left internal mam-mary artery and posterolateral artery and posterior descend-ing artery with the great saphenous vein. An epicardial lead(Medtronic 4968-35 cm) was then placed on the RV diaphrag-matic surface and connected to the newly replaced generator along with the original atrial lead. After confirming successful pacing， the procedure was completed. The patient was extu-bated 15 h later in the intensive care unit， and there were no postoperative complications.\n\n【40】Histopathological examination of the tissue from the perforat-ed site of the RV confirmed slight inflammation without any specific findings such as ischemic changes or infiltrative dam-age. Although the length of hospital stay was prolonged due to non-clinical reasons， the patient was discharged 22 days after surgery. The patient was doing very well 6 months after hospital discharge.\n\n【41】Discussion\n\n【42】The incidence of cardiac perforation caused by the lead of a CIED ranges from 0.1% to 5.2%\\[1，2\\]. Typically， this occurs within 24 h after implantation. Delayed perforation is a rare phenomenon， with only few documented cases in the litera-ture of instances occurring more than 5 years after implanta-tion \\[4-6\\]. To the best of our knowledge， our case represents the most delayed instance of RV perforation caused by CIEDs.\n\n【43】The gradual decrease in the pacing threshold observed over the 2 months preceding perforation may have been indica-tive of the lead tip slowly advancing into the RV myocardium. It is worth noting this gradual decrease in the pacing thresh-old over the 2 months preceding perforation， as the RV pacing threshold usually increases over time \\[7\\]. Therefore， we must\n\n【44】Figure 5. The removed ventricular lead. No thrombus or fibrous tissue adherence was identified.\n\n【45】pay attention not only to an increasing but also to a decreas-ing pacing threshold during the daily CIED check via remote monitoring. Some resistance is noted during lead removal due to the formation of adhesive thrombo-fibrotic lead encapsu-lations and adhesions to the vein wall and endocardium \\[8\\]. However， in this case， there was almost no resistance pres-ent during removal， and no thrombus or fibrous tissue adher-ence to the lead was identified after its removal (Figure 5)， which might have contributed to this delayed RV perforation by lead displacement.\n\n【46】Upon recognition of cardiac perforation， lead extraction is typically recommended to prevent further lead migration and extracardiac complications \\[3，5\\]. Rajkumar et al reported the efficacy of non-surgical transvenous lead extraction for this condition \\[9\\]. However， in our case， the presence of a triple-vessel disease necessitated a surgical extraction； if pericardial effusion had accumulated after transvenous lead extraction. the patient may have immediately become hemodynamical-ly unstable.\n\n【47】In addition， we found no evidence of bloody effusion in the pericardial sac， which may have been due to the oblique pen-etration of the RV wall of the low-pressure system. Although the patient's demographic as a thin， older woman was con-sistent with established risk factors mentioned in the litera-ture， the etiology of the perforation remained uncertain \\[1，3\\]. No indications of infection were present， and there was no history of any improvement in cardiac enlargement following\n\n【48】amelioration of congestive heart failure. Histological analysis of the tissue obtained from the perforated region failed to un-cover any evidence of cardiomyopathy or infarction. The fact that the lead had not adhered to the vasculature may have been a contributing factor to the perforation.\n\n【49】Conclusions\n\n【50】In this study， we describe the case of a delayed RV pacemak-er lead perforation that occurred 9 years post-implantation， which was managed via open surgical repair.\n\n【51】References：\n\n【52】1\\.

Cardiac arrest due to acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is associated with a 90% in-cidence of mortality and， if identified， it can be treated with systemic thrombolytics. Here， we describe a case in which the outcome for such an event was favorable.\n\n【16】Case Report：\n\n【17】A 66-year-old woman was admitted with multiple rib and left ankle fractures due to accidental trauma. Before undergoing orthopedic surgery， she experienced a cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity， which was witnessed. She had refractory hypoxia and hypotension following intubation and a brief initial return of spon-taneous circulation (ROSC) before a second cardiac arrest. A 100-mg bolus dose of systemic thrombolytic ther-apy was promptly administered， with rapid achievement of sustained ROSC The results of a subsequent elec-trocardiogram， echocardiogram， and computed tomography scan further supported the diagnosis of acute PE with right heart strain. Supportive care in the Intensive Care Unit resulted in full neurological recovery and she was discharged to a physical rehabilitation facility 12 days after her cardiac arrest.\n\n【18】Conclusions： Systemic thrombolytic therapy is beneficial for cardiac arrest due to acute PE.\n\n【19】Keywords： Advanced Cardiac Life Support·Death， Sudden， Cardiac · Pulmonary Embolism•\n\n【20】Tissue Plasminogen Activator\n\n【21】Ful-text PDE https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/931215\n\n【22】12十2613 2 Hh\n\n【23】4\n\n【24】21\n\n【25】Approximately 290 000 cases of in-hospital cardiac arrest oc-cur annually in the United States \\[1，2\\]. Over the past decade， the incidence of in-hospital cardiac arrest in adult patients has been increasing \\[2\\]， with survival to discharge rates optimis-tically hovering at approximately 20% to 25% \\[2\\]. The major-ity of these events occur on the general medical and surgical wards and approximately 50% to 60% of them are attributed to cardiac causes (ie， myocardial infarction， arrhythmia， heart failure)； the remainder are largely attributed to respiratory in-sufficiency \\[1\\]. Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) that causes an in-hospital cardiac arrest is a cardiopulmonary event associated with a mortality rate of approximately 90% \\[3，4\\]. The majority of the deaths occur within 1 h of hemodynamic instability \\[5\\]. A recent review highlighted the association between accurately identifying the precipitating cause of a cardiac arrest and pro-viding appropriate and effective resuscitative and post-cardiac arrest care to maximize the chances of favorable outcomes \\[1\\].\n\n【26】The reversible causes of in-hospital cardiac arrests are com-monly referred to as the \"H’s and T’s\" during advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) education for medical providers. These di-agnoses should be used as a list of potential causes (Table 1) to determine the appropriate algorithm to follow during resus-citation and subsequent aftercare \\[6，7\\]. Acute PE， as listed un-der \"thrombosis，\"is an item to be considered for any in-hos-pital cardiac arrest， but specific guidance is lacking regarding treatment with thrombolytic therapy \\[8\\]. Recommendations based upon the consensus opinion of experts or the results of smaller studies state that treatment with systemic throm-bolytics \"should\" or“may\" be “considered\" in the appropriate clinical scenario \\[7-9\\]. As such， the administration of system-ic thrombolytic therapy is dependent upon the clinical prac-tice， experience， and comfort of the individual provider \\[8\\]. One source describes thrombolytic therapy for cardiac arrest due to PE as a“last-resort option\" \\[6\\]， which may be a widely held opinion among resuscitation team members. This view may result in hesitation by a clinician in arriving at an early diagnosis of PE， followed by administration of thrombolytics. However， prompt delivery of thrombolytic therapy in the set-ting of cardiac arrest due to an acute PE can significantly im-prove post-cardiac arrest outcomes 5，8\\].\n\n【27】We present the case of a 66-year-old woman with multiple co-morbidities who presented to the hospital with multiple rib and left lower-extremity fractures secondary to accidental trauma. While awaiting orthopedic intervention， she experienced an in-hospital cardiac arrest. The etiology of her cardiac arrest， along with clinical clues and the rationale that prompted the interventions， are described to illustrate how prompt identifi-cation can lead to delivery of appropriate therapy and patient survival with a favorable neurological outcome.\n\n| The H's  | The T's  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Hypokalemia/hyperkalemia  | Tamponade  |\n| Hypothermia  | Tension pneumothorax  |\n| Hypovolemia  | Thrombosis (coronary or  |\n| Hypovolemia  | pulmonary)  |\n| Hypoxia  | Toxins  |\n| H+ (acidemia or alkalemia)  |  |\n\n【29】Case Report\n\n【30】A non-smoking， functionally independent， 66-year-old wom-an with a history of obesity (body mass index \\[BMI\\] 40.0 kg/m²)， stage I chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to hyperten-sive and diabetic nephropathy， hypertension， hyperlipidemia， and insulin-dependent type II diabetes mellitus presented to the Emergency Department (ED) after a fall while loading a4-wheel all-terrain vehicle into the bed of a truck. She was diagnosed with acute nondisplaced fractures of the seventh through eleventh ribs on the left side as well as comminuted fractures of the left calcaneus and distal fibula. She was ad-mitted to the General Medical Ward for management and op-timization of her chronic diseases before orthopedic interven-tion. After an orthopedic consultation， the decision was made to arrange for helicopter transfer to an affiliated tertiary care center for definitive operative management. Initially， the pa-tient's hospitalization was uneventful and she was hemody-namically stable with no need for supplemental oxygen. The results of her laboratory evaluation on the morning of and pre-ceding her cardiac arrest are presented in Table 2.\n\n【31】Late in the morning on the third day of admission and before aeromedical transfer， the patient experienced acute and rap-id clinical deterioration. She was found to be hypoxic (low-est recorded oxygen saturation 76% with a pulse oximeter) and dyspneic (respiratory rate estimated to be 20 to 30). The patient was describing her symptoms to a Rapid Response Team nurse when she lost consciousness (T-0： 00). She had been given no medications recently (>2 h) for management of pain， anxiety， or agitation. She did not have a puise and the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) resuscitation team was called to the bedside (T+0： 02). Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated， as per the ACLS treatment algorithm， and the initial rhythm was pulseless electrical activity (PEA). After less than4 min of CPR and 2 doses of i.v.epinephrine (1 mg， 1： 10 000concentration)， the patient had return of spontaneous circula-tion (ROSC) (T+0： 04). She was endotracheally intubated with-out difficu lty on the first attempt (endotrachealtube \\[ETT\\] size7.5， depth 22 cm) (T+0： 05).

Oxygen was flow-ing at >15 L/min and the patient was easy to ventilate with a bag-valve device. She had symmetric breath sounds in both lungs but none over the gastric region. While the cause of the patient's hypoxia was being investigated，she became brady-cardic and had a subsequent cardiac arrest with PEA (T+0： 07). Given the clinical setting of acute hypoxic cardiac arrest in a patient with a recent history of orthopedic trauma， the re-sponding intensivist presumptively determined that massive PE was the most likely diagnosis. The decision was made to administer systemic lytic therapy (T+0： 08) with a100-mg bo-lus of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) (T+0：11). ROSC was achieved within 4 min of initiation of the second round of CPR(T+0：13) and the patient had femoral central venous cathe-ter and arterial lines placed for administration of vasopressor therapy and associated hemodynamic monitoring (T+0：21).\n\n【35】Post-resuscitation evaluation at bedside prior to transfer to the ICU included an electrocardiogram (ECG) (Figure 1) (T+0：23) and a portable chest X-ray (T+0： 27) with an anterior-posterior exposure (Figure 2). The chest X-ray demonstrated appropriate placement of the ETT， increased displacement of the seventh rib fracture， and a new airspace opacity in the lower left lung field， hypothesized to be a progressive pulmonary contusion. The ECG revealed a tachycardic rhythm (HR=127 bpm)， a new right bundle branch block， and diffuse t-wave inversions. The patient was then moved to the ICU for post-resuscitation care (T+0：33).\n\n【36】On arrival at the ICU， the patient required nasal packing for a brisk hemorrhage from the right nares. She was persistent-ly hypotensive， requiring vasopressor support (norepineph-rine， 0.9 pg/kg/min) to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP)>65 mmHg. The patient also required 100% oxygen to maintain\n\n【37】oxygen saturation >90%. Arterial blood gas results obtained im-mediately following placement of the femoral arterial line were pH 6.97， pCO， 84 mmHg， and po， 67 mmHg. Her mechanical ventilator settings were a tidal volume of 350 mL (6.2 cc/kg of ideal body weight)， respiratory rate of 30 bpm， and posi-tive end expiratory pressure of 8 cmH，O； her lung mechanics revealed a mean airway pressure of 13 cmH，O. The patient was given an i.v. dose of 50 mEq of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate， with transient improvement in hemodynamics as determined by a 4 ug/kg/min reduction in her vasopressor requirements. The intensivist performed a point-of-care ultrasound of the patient's cardiac function， which revealed hyperdynamic left ventricular function， a dilated right ventricle with hypokinesis， and septal bowing (T+0： 48). Image quality was limited due to body habitus but an emergent formal echocardiogram with i.v. contrast performed by a staff cardiologist approximately2 h post-ROSC confirmed these findings (Figure 3) (T+2：00).\n\n【38】In light of the patient's persistent hemodynamic instability with pre-existing stage lV CKD， her family was updated on the diagnostic and treatment options. They consented to a com-puted tomography angiogram (CTa) of the chest to evaluate thrombotic burden and suitability for advanced therapy， such as catheter-assisted thrombolysis. The interventional radiol-ogist was present in the radiology suite as the study was ob-tained and reviewed the images in real time (T+2： 51). The CTa demonstrated multiple acute pulmonary emboli in the segmen-tal and subsegmental right upper and lower lobes and the left lower lobe pulmonary arteries (Figure 4). The patient also had an acute contusion in the presternal region with possible non-displaced buckle fracture of the sternum， which was likely a sequela of CPR. She was deemed to not be a candidate for ad-ditional advanced therapies and was returned to the ICU for continuation of the current management plan.\n\n【39】Therapeutic hypothermia was not provided to the patient be-cause of concern about increased risk of coagulopathy in the setting of systemic thrombolytic therapy. Her nasal hemorrhage was stabilized with nasal packing and monitoring was ongo-ing for possible intrathoracic hemorrhage following CPR at the sites of the sternal fracture and the pre-existing rib fractures.\n\n【40】Over the next 24 h， the patient’s hemodynamic instability re-solved and she was titrated off vasopressor therapy. A venous duplex ultrasound identified an acute deep vein thrombosis in\n\n【41】the proximal right peroneal veins with no findings in the left lower extremity. She was started on therapeutic anticoagula-tion with infusion of low-molecular-weight heparin and later transitioned to an oral vitamin K antagonist for long-term an-ticoagulation. Her oxygenation improved with decreasing re-quirements for ventilatory support. She was grossly neurologi-cally intact， and 36 h after ROSC she was communicating with her family using written notes while intubated. Approximately48 h after ROSC， she was taken off mechanical ventilation and no reintubation was needed for the remainder of her\n\n【42】Figure 2. Chest X-ray following intubation and resuscitation for cardiac arrest.\n\n【43】hospitalization. The patient required hemodialysis briefly via a temporary dialysis catheter but her renal function recov-ered to baseline within 7 days of the contrast administration for the CTa. Orthopedics recommended conservative non-op-erative management of her lower-extremity fractures. On the12h day after her cardiac arrest， the patient was discharged to an inpatient rehabilitation facility. During the following 12months， the patient continued to do well and she has not re-quired further evaluation in the ED or admission to the hospi-tal. She completed rehabilitation and has returned to her pre-hospitalization level of activity.\n\n【44】The present case report describes the clinical course of a pa-tient who experienced an in-hospital cardiac arrest caused by an acute PE， which was witnessed， and who fully recovered after treatment with systemic thrombolytics. The resuscitative technique was promptly tailored to address the most likely reversible condition of cardiac arrest， based on the patient's clinical history and findings. The literature， to be reviewed in the following discussion， demonstrates that systemic throm-bolytic therapy for in-hospital cardiac arrest may be safer and more beneficial than widely believed when administered to appropriate patients.\n\n【45】Historically， the administration of systemic thrombolysis during CPR has been associated with survival rates of 55% to 100%despite the perceived contraindication associated with coinci-dent CPR\\[3，4，8，10-12\\]. Coagulopathy is one of the most com-monly encountered contraindications to systemic thrombolytic therapy \\[13\\]， but thrombolytic therapy has been provided safely to a small number of patients in cardiac arrest who were being treated with vitamin K antagonists \\[14\\]. Bleeding is the most common complication， but is highly associated with preced-ing operative interventions \\[3\\] and independent of the perfor-mance or duration of chest compressions \\[8，10，11，14，15\\].The incidence of severe or life-threatening bleeding in patients who have experienced cardiac arrest and been treated with systemic thrombolytic therapy is commonly reported to be<1%\\[10，14\\]， although in a meta-analysis， the rate was nearly 10% \\[12\\]. Regardless， the majority of the bleeding complications docu-mented are manageable， with the exception of catastrophic events such as intracerebral hemorrhage \\[3，4，8，10，16\\]. Given\n\n【46】Figure 3. Representative parasternal long axis echocardiograms (A) with contrast augmentation and (B) demonstrating right ventricular dilatation.\n\n【47】Figure 4. Representative image slices from a computed tomography angiogram with residual thrombi in the (A) right upper lobe(arrow) and (B) both lower lobes (arrows).\n\n【48】that the mortality rate for cardiac arrest in- or out-of-hospital can be >95%， the risk-benefit analysis may favor administra-tion of tPA followed by management of complications such as bleeding， if and when they occur \\[1，4，8，10，15\\].\n\n【49】There are no documented randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the efficacy of systemic thrombolytic therapy as a treat-ment for in-hospital cardiac arrest due to suspected or con-firmed acute PE \\[3，4，10，14\\]. A RCT was performed in patients who experienced out-of-hospital cardiac arrest， and although the sample population was very small， systemic thrombolytic therapy appeared to result in an increased rate of ROSC， but the question of survival and disability could not be addressed because of lack of statistical power \\[17\\]. A larger follow-up study of out-of-hospital cases was terminated early due to fu-tility \\[16\\]. Many other studies \\[14，15\\]， reviews \\[3，10\\]，and me-ta-analyses \\[12\\] have demonstrated increased survival rates with minimal disability for in-hospital patients. The rapidity with which our patient recovered and was subsequently ex-tubated is consistent with previously reported findings \\[14\\]. Specifically， a large review described the volume of evidence in support of the neuroprotective benefits of thrombolytic therapy but could not definitively identify the mechanism by which this occurs \\[10\\]. Cardiac arrest serves to activate the co-agulation pathway \\[11，16\\] and it is possible that thrombolyt-ic therapy may mitigate the secondary insults resulting from this pathophysiology. Systemic lytic therapy also may be as-sociated with decreased rates of atrial arrhythmias after acute PE \\[18\\]. Furthermore， it is hypothesized that chest compres-sions in a patient with an acute PE cause mechanical frag-mentation of the thrombus while augmenting microcircula-tion reperfusion \\[3，6\\]. In our patient， this may have been the mechanism by which subsegmental PE were identified in mul-tiple branches of the pulmonary artery on CTa performed af-ter her cardiac arrest.\n\n【50】Identifying patients with cardiac arrest who would be suitable candidates for systemic thrombolytic therapy remains challeng-ing \\[17，19\\]. This is due to the nonspecific presentation associ-ated with acute PE \\[4\\] but it is crucial for optimization of the risk-benefit ratio \\[8\\]. Factors that increase the risk of acute PE include a history of previous thromboembolism， surgery， or major trauma within the preceding month； active cancer； immobilization； estrogen use； tobacco use； chronic pulmonary disease； and chronic heart failure \\[20，21\\]. If thrombolytic ther-apy is provided to an appropriately selected patient in cardiac arrest， ROSC often occurs within minutes \\[10，14，19\\]. Even if prolonged CPR is required prior to achieving ROSC， neurolog-ic function is often well preserved \\[4，6，10，15\\]. Our patient was given a 100-mg dose oftPA， but 50 mg has been demonstrat-ed to provide comparable morbidity and mortality benefits to a population of patients with cardiac arrest due to confirmed massive PE \\[14\\]. In that particular case series， the 2-year sur-vival rate approached 90% \\[14\\]. Alternatively， an out-of-hospi-tal study was terminated for futility when thrombolytic thera-py was provided to all patients with a witnessed cardiac arrest for which the presumed etiology was cardiac \\[16\\].\n\n【51】Conclusions\n\n【52】While the predominance of evidence supports the use of tPA in appropriately selected patients with cardiac arrest， the high rates of success with manageable complications do suggest a publication bias \\[10\\]. The authors of a number of publications have called for prospective RCTs with appropriately selected patient populations \\[3，4，8，10\\] while noting the challenges as-sociated with performing such studies， from both ethical and practical perspectives. In conclusion， however， it would appear that clinicians should be aware of this treatment approach in the context of the clinical presentation of the patient they\n\n【53】find before them. The location of a patient on the risk-bene-fit continuum shifts drastically with the occurrence of cardi-ac arrest； therapies that have previously been described as“last resorts” may now provide more benefit contextually. If the clinical situation strongly suggests acute PE as the most likely cause of a cardiac arrest， the published literature sug-gests that systemic thrombolytics should be strongly consid-ered and administered as soon as practical. In patients who survive， the evidence suggests that the morbidity and mor-tality profile will be excellent. Our report describes just such a case with an extremely favorable outcome in an elderly wom-an with multiple comorbidities.\n\n【54】References：\n\n【55】1\\. Andersen LW， Holmberg M， Berg KM， et al.

Adult patients presenting with Auer Rods are summarized in the ta-ble I. Generally， patients presented with mild leukocytosis or leukopenia， and dysplasia in the myeloid lineage seems to be the common characteristic. Auer rods in the mature neutrophils in AML is evidence of cytoplasmic immaturity representing the presence of nucleocytoplasmic asynchrony. They are known to confer a favourable prognosis that is independent of cytogenet-ics. This unusual case of APL was characterized with the rarity of atypical promyelocytes in the bone marrow， distinct dysplasia in the myeloid and megakaryocytic lineages and silent clinical course without coagulopathy which caused a delay in diagnosis， and well response to treatment.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】We have shown that Auer rods in mature neutrophils are as-sociated with APL. Their presence in mature neutrophils point that these cells are part of a malign clone； but， their role is still unclear. A diagnosis of APL should be kept in mind in adult patients with cytopenia in blood count and silent clinical course.\n\n【24】Competing Interests\n\n【25】None\n\n【26】Funding\n\n【27】None\n\n【28】References\n\n【29】1\\.

PRES is most commonly diagnosed in patients who experience acute hypertensive crisis， are solid organ or bone marrow transplant recipients on immuno-suppressants， are pre-eclamptic or eclamptic， have autoimmune disease or severe inflammatory renal conditions such as glomerulonephritis \\[1\\]. The typical imaging findings include vasogenic edema involving the white matter of the parietal and occipital lobes(posterior circulation)， occasionally associated with areas of restricted diffusion. These areas of restricted diffusion often normalize with prompt treatment， however， they can progress to acute infarction if the diagnosis is delayed. The typical clinical presentation is new onset seizure， mental status change/encepha-lopathy， headache， and/or visual change-often in the setting of an acute hypertensive crisis. The term，“Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome”continues to be used in medical literature and practice due to its descriptive nature of the typical imaging and clinical findings that occur in a very heterogeneous group of patients， with heterogeneous etiologies.\n\n【26】Prompt diagnosis is essential to avoid complications such as infarction and hemorrhage. However， in the absence of clinical information， the MR diagnosis of PRES can occasionally be confusing. This is especially true in cases of acute PRES with less common MRI\n\n【27】Figure 1. 28 year-old female with relapsed AML and therapeutic levels of tacrolimus. MRI was obtained after a relative hypertensive episode， followed by mental status change and possible seizure.Images show abnormal in creased FLAIR signal within the sub-cortical white matter and the overlying cortex of the posterior occipital/parietal lobes as well as the frontal lobes near vertex. The signal abnormalities are in a slightly asymmetric pattern. The findings are consistent with an acute presentation of PRES. There is abnormal nodular leptomeningeal contrast enhancement corresponding to the areas of abnormal FLAIR siqnal.\n\n【28】features such as vasogenic edema in atypical locations(frontal lobes， deep gray structures， brainstem)，and contrast enhancement in the acute setting without infarction or hemorrhage. We present three cases of acute PRES with atypical imaging features (mixed patterns of contrast enhancement during the acute presentation) in patients with the following underlying pathologies： 1.)relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia(AML)； 2.) metastatic breast cancer； 3.) vasculitic glomerulonephritis and chronic renal failure. In all three cases， the pattern of contrast enhancement could be misdiagnosed as disease progression or a complication related to the patient’s underlying diag-nosis (leptomeningeal carcinomatosis， metastasis and vasculitis， respectively) if imaging occurred without knowledge of the acute clinical scenario.\n\n【29】CASE REPORT\n\n【30】Case 1：\n\n【31】A 28-year-old female presented with an acute exac erbation of her chronic graph-versus-host disease of the skin and liver. She was 179 days status post allo-genic bone marrow transplant and induction chemo-therapy for relapsed AML， with a normal therapeutic level of tacrolimus. She had a stable baseline hepatic encephalopathy. During her hospitalization， she ex-perienced a 2-minute period of unresponsiveness with upper extremity and facial twitching. Her blood pressure following the seizure was 148/108 mmHg. Her baseline blood pressure was a systolic range of106-140 mmHg， with a diastolic range of 63-86 mmHg. MR imaging was performed approximately 2-hours following her seizure which showed symmetrically increased T2W/FLAIR signal within the cortex and subcortical white matter of the occipital， parietal and frontal lobes (Fig.1). There was corresponding nodular leptomeningeal contrast enhancement in the occipital， parietal and frontal lobes. There were no acute infarcts and no intracranial hemorrhages. The MRI findings were consistent with acute PRES. Her tacrolimus was discontinued and her blood pressure was stabilized and carefully monitored. Follow-up MRI several days later showed resolution of the T2W/FLAIR abnormal signal and resolution of the nodular leptomeningeal contrast enhancement. There were no delayed infarctions or hemorrhages. CSF analysis showed no evidence of recurrent AML.\n\n【32】Case 2：\n\n【33】A 66-year-old female presented to the hospital with history of breast cancer and known metastasis to the thoracic and lumbar spine. She was originally treated in 1991 with a right lumpectomy， axillary lymph node\n\n【34】dissection， radiation therapy and hormonal therapy for 5 years. She was admitted for a decompressive laminectomy secondary to her spinal metastasis. Medications included oxycodone， morphine， docusate， aspirin， and metoprolol. During her post-operative recovery， she experienced a tonic-clonic seizure during a hypertensive crisis with a maximum systolic pressure of 210 mmHg. MRI was performed approximately6 hours following her episode and showed multiple areas of increased T2W/FLAIR signal involving the occipital， temporal， parietal and posterior frontal lobes(Fig. 2). There were no acute infarcts and no intracra-nial hemorrhages. There was cortical and trace lepto-meningeal contrast enhancement overlying the areas of abnormal T2W/FLAIR signal， consistent with acute PRES，presumably from her hypertensive crisis. Her blood pressure was stabilized and carefully monitored. Follow-up MRI three days later showed a decrease in the abnormal T2W/FLAIR signal and resolution of the abnormal contrast enhancement. There were no late on-set infarctions or hemorrhages.\n\n【35】Case 3：\n\n【36】A 71-year-old male presented with an acute exacerba-tion of chronic renal failure from pANCA vasculitic glomerulonephritis. His medical history included hypertension that was well-controlled. During his hospitalization， he started dialysis and immunosup-pressive therapy (solumedrol， prednisone， and cyclo-phosphamide). He then developed cortical blindness following a witnessed seizure. MRI was performed within 1 -2 hours following his acute presentation to evaluate for cerebral infarction. The scan showed a fairly symmetric pattern of increased T2W/FLAIR signal involving the posterior occipital， parietal and posterior frontal lobe subcortical white matter， with patchy involvement of the overlying cortex (Fig. 3). There were no acute infarcts or intracranial hemor-rhages. There was prominent cortical/sub-cortical and trace leptomeningeal contrast enhancement in the regions of abnormal T2W/FLAIR signal， con-sistent with acute PRES， presumably secondary to a hypertensive crisis and/or cyclophosphamide ex-posure. There was no retrospective documentation available to assess for an acute hypertensive crisis. MR venogram， permeability and perfusion stud-ies were all normal. His blood pressure was closely monitored and he had a significant reduction in his cyclophosphamide dosage. Follow-up examination 10days later showed interval development of sub-acute infarction within the bi-parietal and bi-occipital lobes with corresponding contrast enhancement. These sub-acute infarctions occurred after the acute clinical and imaging presentation，consistent with sub-acute PRES complication.\n\n【37】Figure 2.66 year-old female with breast cancer and metastasis to the spine. MRI was obtained following a hypertensive crisis with tonic-clonic seizure activity. There is abnormal in creased FLAIR signal within the sub-cortical white matter and cortex of the posterior occipital， parietal and frontal lobes， consistent with PRES. There is corresponding abnormal cortical and trace leptomeningeal contrast enhancement.\n\n【38】DISCUSSION\n\n【39】Typical clinical and imaging features：\n\n【40】Poster reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is clinically characterized by headaches， altered mental status，seizures， cortical visual disturbance， nausea and vomiting \\[1-10\\]. Predisposing conditions include： an acute severe hypertensive episode (an acute hyperten-sive episode relative to the patient’s baseline blood pres-sure)； cyclosporine/immunomodulator medications (ta-crolimus， interferon-alpha， cisplatin， cylophosphamide)； eclampsia/pre-eclampsia； chronic renal insufficiency； hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocyto-penic purpura； and autoimmune disorders \\[1-10\\].\n\n【41】Figure 3. 71 year-old male with acute exacerbation of chronic renal failure from vasculitic glomerulonephritis. MRl was obtained after a seizure and development of cortical blindness. There is a relatively symmetric pattem of abnormal increased FLAIR signal in the sub-cortical white matter with patchy involvement of the overlying cortex of the posterior occipital， parietal and frontal lobes， consistent with PRES. There is corresponding abnormal cortical/sub-cortical and trace leptomeningeal contrast enhancement.\n\n【42】Highly characteristic neuro-imaging features include abnormal increased T2W/FLAIR signal， thought to be vasogenic edema， primarily within the whitem+1atter of the posterior circulation territories with typical sparing of the calcarine and paramedian re-gions of the occipital lobes \\[4\\]. The frontal/temporal white matter may be involved as well as gray matter structures such as the cortex and basal ganglia \\[4\\]. Contrast enhancement has been described in the literature， however most of the reported contrast enhancement is secondary to complications such as subacute infarction \\[2-4\\].\n\n【43】A recent review of the imaging patterns and lesion distribution in PRES in 136 patients defined five major clinical subgroups and three major MR im-aging patterns (not including一 partial or asymmetricvariations) \\[1\\]. The five major clinical subgroups in-cluded： 1) postinfection， sepsis， or shock associated with multiple organ dysfunction； 2) posttransplanta-tion (cyclosporine or FK-51cyCIOSPOr06) neurotoxic syndrome；3) postchemotherapy； 4) autoimmune diseases； and5) eclampsia \\[1\\]. The three major imaging patterns included： \\[1\\] holohemispheric，\\[2\\] superior frontal sulcal， and \\[3\\] dominant parietal-occipital \\[1\\]. Within this series， the typical posterior-only pattern (dominant parietal-occipital) was observed in only 22.1% of pa-tients. However， an additional 22.8% of patients had the holohemispheric watershed pattern， with vasogenic edema involving the parietal and occipital lobes in the typical pattern with anterior extension into the frontal lobes. Nonetheless， the “typical”posterior pattern oc-curred in less than 50% of cases. Twenty-seven percent of cases had a distinct involvement of the frontal lobes. with varying degrees of parietal and occipital involve-ment. Partial or asymmetric variations of these three patterns occurred in 27.9 % of their study population. The authors reported 19 cases (out of 88 available studies performed with IV gadolinium contrast) show-ing stippled cortical enhancement corresponding to the areas of vasogenic edema 1\\]. However， they did not report on how many of these cases also had con-current infarction or hemorrhage that could explain the abnormal contrast enhancement.\n\n【44】The authors of this study did not find a statistical correlation of the maximum blood pressures during the acute phase， the underlying clinical associations or the imaging patterns \\[1\\]. Reversal of the vasogenic edema was not statistically different among the clini-cal categories or the imaging categories. No single clinical group or imaging pattern was associated with a greater risk of infarction or hemorrhage. The authors did not comment on which clinical groups or imaging patterns were more likely to have abnormal contrast enhancement.\n\n【45】In an effort to improve radiologic detection and ac-curacy， many authors have demonstrated additional imaging features associated with PRES. Some authors report that ADCvalues on MRI are helpful to distin-guish between those patients that are likely to reverse and those that may progress to infarction； higher ADC values are considered more likely to reverse\\[4-5\\]. MRI perfusion results have been varied， with some authors showing no change in the cerebral blood volume (CBV) or in the mean transit time (MTT)\\[6\\]. Other authors show decreased CBV， decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF)， and variable MTT in the affected areas \\[7\\]. MRI permeability examinations have failed to show any significant change in perme-ability \\[7\\]. Diffusion-tensor MR imaging (DTI) in acute PRES showed significant increased isotropic diffusion coefficient and significant decreased anisot-ropy in the affected areas \\[3\\]. Follow-up DTI showed reversal of the elevated isotropic diffusion and partial recovery of the anisotropy loss \\[3\\].\n\n【46】In our series， all three patients had a“holohemispheric watershed pattern”\\[1\\] with complete or near-com plete reversal of the vasogenic edema upon follow-up imaging in cases 1 and 2. The only “atypical\"imaging characteristic in our three cases was the abnormal contrast enhancement associated with the underlying vasogenic edema， without concurrent infarction or hemorrhage--herein is the potential diagnostic chal-lenge that could arise without the knowledge of the acute clinical presentation. The nodular leptomeningeal contrast enhancement in case 1， along with the cortical and subcortical FLAIR signal abnormalities， could be misdiagnosed as multifocal metastatic leukemic masses infiltrating the leptomeninges. In case 2， the cortical and leptomeningeal contrast enhancement， along with the corresponding FLAIR signal abnormalities， could be misdiagnosed as cortical and leptomeningeal metastatic breast cancer. In case 3， the cortical/subcor-tical and leptomeningeal contrast enhancement， and FLAIR signal abnormalities， could be misdiagnosed as acute CNS vasculitis. The clinical and radiographic differential diagnosis of PRES is vast， however has been organized by Servillo et al. \\[9\\] into 5 broad categories：CNS vasculitis， acute or subacute neurological disorders(ranging from ischemic stroke to infectious encepha litis)， mitochondrial diseases， CNS collagen diseases， and hypoglycemia/hyponatremia \\[9\\].\n\n【47】As previously discussed， ADC values may provide additional prognostic clues to the potential revers-ibility of PRES. Unfortunately in our cases， each MRI was performed in different MRI scanners at different institutions without standardized ADC values. Therefore a comparison of ADC values could not be performed in our small sample. Evaluation of\n\n【48】the ADC values may have been most helpful in the third case， since this patient proceeded to cerebral infarction. DTI may have a similar predictive ability as the ADC values to predict cases that are likely to progress to infarction. MR perfusion may also help predict cases that may infarct as well as help identify the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism of PRES. Nonetheless， MRI perfusion is likely less helpful in the acute clinical setting， given the increased imaging time required and the heterogeneity of the perfusion findings in PRES (likely due to the variability in etiol-ogy of PRES). Regardless， MR perfusion and DTI may not be available in many institutions， or is not a part of the standard brain imaging protocols\n\n【49】Etiology：\n\n【50】There are two primary hypotheses regarding the pathophysiology of PRES， the vasogenic edema theory and the cytotoxic edema theory \\[1-8\\]. The vasogenic edema theory suggests that excessive elevation of the mean arterial pressure overwhelms the normal cerebral autoregulation (which is more fragile in the posterior circulation)， leading to arteriolar vasodila-tion and endothelial cell dysfunction \\[8\\].Ultimately， there is a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier with capillary leakage causing vasogenic cerebral edema\\[8\\]. Elevated ADC values， increased isotropic diffu-sion and decreased anisotropy values， which may all be reversible， support the vasogenic edema model\\[3-4\\]. Studies showing no significant change in per-meability do not support this model \\[7\\].\n\n【51】The cytotoxic edema model suggests that acute hy-pertensive episodes cause cerebral vasoconstriction leading to cerebral ischemia， endothelial cell damage and ultimately cytotoxic edema \\[8\\]. The MRI perfu-1171sion studies support this model \\[7\\].\n\n【52】There is a wide spectrum of pre-disposing factors and disease processes that can cause PRES. A single\n\n【53】REFERENCES：\n\n【54】1\\.

Contrast enhance-ment is the result of a breakdown in the blood-brain barrier， which is thought to be associated with both models.\n\n【60】Given that PRES occurs in such a heterogeneous group of diseases and has a heterogeneous collection of pre-disposing conditions， it is our opinion that both the vasogenic edema and the cytotoxic edema models have merit. Regarding our cases， we do not have any specific imaging findings that would favor one model over the other. It is our opinion that identification of the precise pathophysiologic etiology is not the most critical task in the evaluation of acute PRES. especially since both proposed mechanisms result in similar clinical and imaging patterns. In fact， it is impractical to perform rigorous MRI studies such as perfusion imaging and DTI in the busy clinical setting and in these acutely sick patients. Even the admin-istration of contrast-agents is increasingly becoming restricted due to risks of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis(NSF)， and the pressures of cost-controls in medical imaging. Additionally， the treatment of PRES is the same for all patients and all imaging patterns. In cases with hypertension， the mean arterial blood pressure should be lowered approximately 25% within the first hour of acute symptoms， with continued gradual reduction over the next 24 hours \\[9-10\\]. In all cases， it is essential to discontinue or severely reduce the medications that are associated with PRES \\[9-101.\n\n【61】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【62】Atypical imaging features， such as an unusual pattern of vasogenic edema or abnormal contrast enhance-ment， can be present in acute cases of PRES \\[1-4\\].

As a complication of radiofrequency ablation， pseudoaneurysm can be treated conservatively or by ultrasound-guided throm-bin injection.\n\n【26】Case Report\n\n【27】An 82-year-old female patient was accepted to our hospital to undergo radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of fre-quent ventricular premature contractions. The Holter moni-tor (24 hours) indicated 31 325 ventricular premature beats， which accounted for 31.7% of the total number of heartbeats. Presurgical examination found no clear contraindications. Electrocardiographic (ECG) examination revealed ventricular premature beats coming from the left ventricle， and the cul-prit tissue was ablated with catheter via the right femoral ar-tery. The operation of radiofrequency ablation was successful as shown by ECG examination.\n\n【28】The bandage compressing the puncture site was removed 24hours later， no hemorrhage or murmur was observed. Forty-eight hours later， the patient complained about pain in her right lower limb artery puncture site. The physical examina-tion revealed swelling in her right lower limb with ecchymosis， and a murmur could be detected at the femoral artery punc-ture site. A follow-up blood routine showed a decrease of he-moglobin. Color Doppler ultrasound indicated the formation of pseudoaneurysms in the right femoral artery. Because the treatment of compression using bandage was not effective in achieving pseudoaneurysm thrombosis， the patient was sub jected to ultrasound-guided bovine thrombin injection. After percutaneous injection of thrombin directly into the pseudoa-neurysmal sac under real-time ultrasound guidance， successful thrombosis was confirmed immediately with Doppler imaging.\n\n【29】One hour after the thrombin injection， the patient presented with nausea， tremble， chest tightness， high fever (38.9C)，and drop in blood pressure. The blood test showed a critical de-crease in leukocyte (WBC 0.87x10/L)， progressive decrease in hemoglobin and platelet， progressive elevated in fibrin/fibrin-ogen degradation products (FDP) and D-dimer， and liver dys-function (alanine aminotransferase： 409 U/L). The ECG showed ST-segment depression and T-wave inversion in leads V4-V6. Further examinations including blood gas analysis， urinalysis， echocardiography， and abdominal ultrasound were normal.\n\n【30】In view of the aforementioned symptoms， an allergic reaction to thrombin was considered and the patient was treated ac-cordingly. Under ECG， blood pressure and SpO2 (peripheral\n\n【31】capillary oxygen saturation) monitoring， the patient received oxygen inhalation， fluid infusion， dopamine， dexamethasone， suspension red blood cell， fresh frozen plasma， supportive liver protection therapy， and other symptomatic treatments. Finally， the vital signs of the patient became stable and the results of blood tests， including routine blood tests， coagulation func-tion test， and liver function tests improved.\n\n【32】Discussion\n\n【33】An acute pseudoaneurysm is a lacuna filled with blood from a ruptured artery， encompassed by fibromuscular tissues， and intercommunicates with the artery by means of a narrow neck. The puncture-site femoral pseudoaneurysm can occur due to procedures such as cardiac catheterization and peripheral ar-tery angiography. Pseudoaneurysm is commonly treated by non-invasive ultrasound-guided compression. However， this time-consuming procedure brings discomfort to both the pa-tient and the operator， and its effectiveness for large pseudo-aneurysms and patients on anticoagulation therapy is limited. Surgical repair might be required for some patients. As a sub-stitution to compression therapy， ultrasound-guided throm-bin injection gives better results in the treatment of pseudo-aneurysm \\[1-4\\].\n\n【34】A series of reports suggested that complete thrombosis in the pseudoaneurysm sac was accomplished in more than 90% of patients receiving bovine thrombin injection； thrombin injection has also been used when compression is unsuccessful \\[5，6\\]. A case control study in 30 patients showed that thrombin in-jection is more effective than pure compression\\[7\\]\n\n【35】Allergic reaction caused by thrombin is rare and is probably due to the generation of antibodies to bovine thrombin in the human body which renders cross-reaction with factor V. The presence of human blood coagulation inhibitors may in-duce abnormal bleeding and interfere with clotting measure-ments. Platelet infusions， fresh frozen plasma，and activated prothrombin complex concentrates have been used in the man-agement of acute hemorrhagic complications， though often with limited effect. Treatment with corticosteroids， cyclospo-rine， antineoplastics， intravenous immunoglobulin， and plas-mapheresis can be applied to reduce the antibody titer \\[8，9\\].\n\n【36】Conclusions\n\n【37】For the case presented here， it was highly suspected that an allergic reaction to thrombin occurred after thrombin injec-tion. The successful management of the patient’s symptoms with symptomatic treatment to the allergic reaction to throm-bin also supported the conjecture. In view of this， we think it\n\n【38】is important to check a patient’s history of allergies to throm-bin when considering treating pseudoaneurysm with thrombin injection； a skin prick test is recommended when necessary.\n\n【39】References：\n\n【40】1\\.

Mexico was not included in the first-ever report on a global cohort of patients with this coinfection. We report on a case of SARS-CoV-2/MBT coinfection in a 51-year-old taxi driver from Mexico City that underscores the importance of rapid and accurate laboratory testing， diagnosis， and treatment.\n\n【21】Case Report： We present the case of a man in the sixth decade of life who was admitted to the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases (INER) with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia， which was confirmed by nasopharyngeal exudate using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the identification of SARS-CoV-2. Findings from imaging studies suggested that the patient might be coinfected with MBT. That suspicion was confirmed with light mi-croscopy of a sputum sample after Ziehl-Neelsen staining and when a Cepheid Xpert MTB/RIF assay， an auto-mated semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay， failed to detect rifampicin resistance. The patient was discharged from the hospital 10 days later.\n\n【22】Conclusions： The present report underscores the importance of using validated molecular diagnostic tests to identify coin-fections in areas where there is a high prevalence of other causes of pneumonia， such as MBT， as a way to improve clinical outcomes in patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. While it is imperative to control the COVID-19 pandemic， the medical community must not forget about the other pandemics to which populations are still prey， and tuberculosis is one of them. We must remain alert to any clinical subtleties so as to ensure timely and accurate diagnosis and stay one step ahead of COVID-19.\n\n【23】MeSH Keywords： Coinfection·COVID-19·Mycobacterium tuberculosis ·Coronavirus Infections·\n\n【24】Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome· SARS Virus · Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction\n\n【25】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/927628\n\n【26】The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in incalculable damage， from economic devastation to the col-lapse of health services in countries around the world. Included in the fractured health systems are programs that address other health emergencies， such as tuberculosis (TB) and HIV infection.\n\n【27】According to the World Health Organization (WHO)， as of August 31， 2020， there were 25 118 689 confirmed COVID-19cases and just over 840 000 deaths due to the disease. More than half of all the confirmed cases have occurred in North and South America \\[1\\]. Besides being whipped by this pandemic， the Americas (especially Latin America and Mexico) have also been targets of TB， which caused 1.8 million deaths in 2015according to the WHO \\[2\\].\n\n【28】Although it is rare， coinfection with severe acute respira-tory syndrome-associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) has been reported in var-ious parts of the world. It has received much attention from health systems because up to one-third of the world's popula-tion world is infected with MBT \\[2\\]. The first-ever global cohort of 49 cases of COVID-19/TB coinfection from 8 countries did not include Mexico because it had no such cases to report \\[3\\].\n\n【29】During the SARS outbreak in Singapore in 2004， Low et al. re-ported on 2 cases of SARS/pulmonary TB coinfection. As in the case described here， 1 patient was a man in the sixth de-cade of life， who was diagnosed with TB days after being dis-charged because of a persistent cough. In the case from Low and the 1 presented here， smoking was an important factor in the patients' medical history and none had a history of TB. The authors of the report from Singapore theorized that their patients developed active pulmonary TB after acquiring SARS， probably as a result of SARS-induced temporary suppression of cellular immunity， which further predisposed the men to an aggravated reactivation or new infection with TB， as occurs in other viral infections， such as measles and HIV \\[4\\].\n\n【30】In China in 2006， 3 cases of SARS and 2 cases of TB were iden-tified. In all 3 SARS cases， levels of CD4 -and CD8-positive cells were low， compromising the production of antibodies against SARS and delaying viral clearance \\[5\\].\n\n【31】Clinically， the similarities in signs and symptoms of SARS and TB， such as cough and dyspnea， may affect the diagnosis \\[4\\]. Timely diagnosis may be more likely now， given the current health emergency and presentation of patients with acute cases of COVID-19. Individuals with COVID-19 may exhibit characteristic symptoms of TB， such as hemoptysis， weight loss， and anorexia， as reported in a 19-year-old patient in the United States \\[4，6\\].\n\n【32】To make the diagnosis， the US Food and Drug Administration(FDA) and the WHO have approved the use of the Xpert MTB/RIF Assay， which returns results in 2 hours and has a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 99%\\[7-9\\]. It is an automated in vitro diagnostic test that uses nested real-time PCR (RT-PCR) for qualitative detection of the MTB complex and resistance gene to rifampicin in tissue or sputum samples. The assay can be performed with the GeneXpert instrument system， which is the tool recommended for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and MBT.\n\n【33】Motta et al.， in an analysis of 2 previously described cohorts of 49 and 20 patients， determined that the mortality rate for SARS-CoV-2/MBT coinfection was up to 11.6%， and conclud-ed that the decisive factors in the deaths were old age and comorbidities \\[10\\].\n\n【34】Up to one-third of the 49 patients described by Tadolini and her working group who had MBT/COVID-19 coinfection were diagnosed with COVID-19 as the first infection \\[11\\]. In 53%of the cases， coinfection with MBT was present prior to the SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis， in 18% the diagnoses were made si-multaneously， and 85.7% had active MBT. The mean age of the patients was 45.5 years. Of them， 14.3% had recovered from MBT， on average 8.2 years before， and some sequelae were documented； 8 of them had some type of resistance to antitu-berculosis drugs. The mortality rate reported in the study was12.3%\\[3\\]. The symptoms described by Tadolini et al. in the se-ries were dry cough， chest tightness， shortness of breath， di-arrhea， and fever. On blood tests， lymphopenia was the most characteristic finding. These authors also theorized that drugs used to treat COVID-19 leave patients“vulnerable\" to devel-opment of other infections， such as MBT \\[11\\].\n\n【35】Chen et al. proposed that MTB infection status might be a specific risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection rather than for pneumonia in general. Their findings suggest the following：MTB infection is associated with more rapid development of symptoms， as well as development of more severe COVID-19symptoms， and MTB infection could be a more important risk factor than other comorbidities commonly reported， such as diabetes and hypertension \\[12\\].\n\n【36】Case Report\n\n【37】We present the case of a 51-year-old-man from Mexico City who worked as a taxi driver. He denied having been in caves， mines or prisons， taking recent trips， or being in contact with patients confirmed to have COVID-19 or MBT. His medical his-tory was significant for a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus10 years previously. Since then， he had been taking metformin， but his adherence to the medication was poor.\n\n【38】On June 20， 2020， the man began experiencing anosmia， dys-geusia， and nocturnal diaphoresis. Two days later， he went to a health center for SARS-CoV-2 screening， and the results were positive. Three days after that， the patient went to a hospital， where he was admitted because of glycemic dysregulation； he was discharged on June 30， 2020. 0n July 4， 2020， the patient presented with complaints of bouts of intense coughing and shortness of breath and was evaluated at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases. He could not recall what treatment he had received while hospitalized.\n\n【39】In the Emergency Department， the patient's peripheral oxygen saturation was 75% on room air and recovered up to 92% with nasal cannulation at 5 liters per min. Physical examination re-vealed bilateral subscapular crackles but no other symptoms， so the man was admitted for diagnostic testing.\n\n【40】The results of initial arterial blood gas testing suggested a mixed acid-base disorder with metabolic acidosis and respi-ratory alkalosis. The only other significant finding on blood testing was thrombocytosis (512，000 cells/pL). Testing of a nasopharyngeal exudate sample with RT-PCR using the FDA-approved COVID-19 Plus RealAmp Kit was positive.\n\n【41】Regarding data from imaging， on inspiratory high-resolution computed tomography (CT)， subpleural and bilateral ground-glass patchy opacities were visible，some of which had a ten-dency to consolidate，and an air bronchogram was suggestive of COVID-19. Likewise， a cavitary lesion was observed in the left pulmonary apex (Figures 1，2) and adenopathy <1 cm was seen in the mediastinal window (Figures 3， 4). These findings may have been a result of the proinflammatory state caused by SARS-CoV-2.\n\n【42】Because of the CT findings， bacilloscopy was performed， with positive results. Ziehl-Neelsen staining was performed on a smear taken from the direct expectoration sample (Figure 5). A GeneXpert MTR/RIF test also was performed， and returned positive for MBT sensitive to rifampicin.\n\n【43】The patient was started on a standard antituberculosis reg-imen (rifampicin， pyrazinamide， isoniazid， and ethambutol). No invasive mechanical ventilation was required His condi-tion improved and he was discharged 10 days after admission and continued taking antituberculosis treatment for 9 months. Because the patient's clinical presentation was not severe， he responded to conservative measures， and there is no safe or effective treatment for SAR-CoV-2， he received only support-ive care for it and the treatment for TB.\n\n【44】Figure 1. Chest computed tomography scan with lung window. The low attenuation in the left upper lobe and walls >4mm surrounded by multiple centrilobular micronodules are consistent with a cavitation. In the rest of the parenchyma， subpleural and peri-bronchovascular pulmonary consolidations are visible. The patient was coinfected with COVID-19 and tuberculosis.\n\n【45】Figure 2. Chest computed tomography scan with lung window. The high attenuation in the images is consistent with centrilobular nodules and micronodules， as is the tree-in-bud pattern in the left upper lobe.\n\n【46】Discussion\n\n【47】Incidence of COVID-19/MBT coinfection in countries like Africa and Mexico may be increased by a third， equally serious dis-ease： HI. Patients with it may be predisposed to COVID-19 or MBT because of immune system vulnerability \\[13\\].\n\n【48】On July 6， The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS(UNAIDS) reported that 14 countries had achieved the 90-90-90\n\n【49】Figure 3. Chest computed tomography scan with mediastinal window. Mediastinal nodes measuring 8.61 mm are seen in the image of station 4R.\n\n【50】Figure 4. Chest computed tomography scan with mediastinal window， which shows 10.6-mm mediastinal nodes in the image of station 2R.\n\n【51】HlV treatment goals (90% of people living with HIlV know their Hl status， of whom 90% are on antiretroviral treatment， and of whom 90% are virally suppressed). However， with the ad-vent of the COVID-19 pandemic， this progress may be under-mined in the coming years. The number of deaths from and cases of HIV infection may increase， leading to a secondary increase in the number of cases of TB \\[14\\].\n\n【52】As noted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) in a study in Taiwan in 2003， the screening model that was used during the SARS epidemic helped to identify cases of TB in an area in which the disease was endemic. Such was the case in Mexico， which underscores the importance of perform-ing diagnostic testing to start treatment promptly， and thus， improve clinical outcomes in patients with this coinfection \\[15\\].\n\n【53】Figure 5. High-power photomicrograph taken with light microscopy which shows Ziehl-Neelsen staining\n\n【54】(purple) of Mycobacterium tubercutosis in a sputum\n\n【55】sample from a 51-year-old taxi driver from Mexico City. Magnificationx400.\n\n【56】Zumla and his colleagues have estimated that in the next 5years， the annual number of cases and deaths from TB may increase as attention is diverted away from TB treatment and prevention programs by the new COVID-19 pandemic \\[16，17\\].\n\n【57】According to an Italian study， lymphocytopenia and thrombo-cytopenia are commonly reported on laboratory testing of in-dividuals with COVID-19/MBT coinfection. Of such patients evaluated in their institution， 95% presented with high lev-els of D-dimer and 63% of patients tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 14 days after the first diagnosis. None of these patients were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or required me-chanical ventilation \\[18\\].\n\n【58】In contrast to the literature， in our reported case， the patient presented with thrombocytosis instead of thrombocytopenia. In keeping with published reports， our patient did not require invasive mechanical ventilation or ICU admission. He was given only antituberculosis therapy and no treatment for COVID-19.\n\n【59】In a study by He et al， 3 patients with SARS-CoV-2/MBT coin-fection were identified， 2 of whom had histories of infection with MBT. The patient in our case， however， had not previous-ly been diagnosed with TB \\[19\\].\n\n【60】In the few published reports of SARS-CoV-2/MBT coinfection， the TB diagnosis was made with a tuberculin test. Akbar et al. reported negative results of an acid-fast bacillus smear and cul-ture and of an QuantiFERON-TB Gold test in the patient they described \\[6\\]. In our case， the diagnosis was made with bac-illoscopy and the GeneXpert MTB/RIF test.\n\n【61】On imaging studies of patients with COVID-19， ground-glass opacities， consolidations with identifiable air bronchogram， and sequelae of previous cavitating lesions have been reported \\[19\\]. On CT， enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes and pulmonary nod-ules have been identified in these individuals \\[6\\]. COVID-19also can manifest on chest CT as a crazy paving pattern or in airway changes or a reverse halo sign. Ye at al. noted bilater-al distribution of ground-glass opacities with or without con-solidation in the posterior and periphery of lungs as the car-dinal hallmark of the disease \\[20\\].\n\n【62】In regard to treatment for SARS-CoV-2/MBT coinfection，stan-dard antituberculosis therapy (pyrazinamide， rifampicin， iso-niazid， and ethambutol) and hydroxychloroquine have been used and been well tolerated by most patients \\[18\\]. For ear-ly-stage infection， short-term glucocorticoid therapy， together with a standard anti-TB regimen， was the specific treatment adopted by He et al. That group identified a previous history of TB infection and longevity as risk factors for a poor prog-nosis and a longer recovery period in people infected with SARS-CoV-219\n\n【63】In the present case， we intentionally looked for presence of acute kidney injury， given the patient's comorbidities and our group's previous experience， but found no evidence of it \\[21\\].\n\n【64】Despite the few reported cases of MBT/COVID-19 coinfection， the medical and scientific community would do well to con-sider previous exposure to MBT in patients with milder pre sentations of SARS-CoV-2 infection. It has been hypothesized that Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccination provides protection against respiratory infections through the molecular mimicry of the vaccine proteins and some viral structures， and the pop-ulation of B and T lymphocytes derived from vaccination \\[22\\]. Tadolini et al. studied a cohort of 69 patients and identified a group of coinfected young migrant patients who developed mild symptoms of COVID-19 \\[3\\]， which was probably due to previous MBT infection. However，evidence on COVID-19/MBT coinfection remains limited and the number of reported cases is minimal. Prospective studies with larger populations are re-quired to elucidate the relationship between the 2 diseases.\n\n【65】With regard to mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic， as with TB， testing is recommended in any individual who has respirato-ry symptoms to prevent the spread of the 2 diseases， in both community and nosocomial settings \\[9\\]. It is even more im-portant in patients who have symptoms that are non-acute， have become exacerbated，or are chronic.\n\n【66】Conclusions\n\n【67】The social， epidemiological， and public health situation in which we currently find ourselves unequivocally dictates that SARS-Cov-2 testing be performed on anyone who presents with respiratory and non-respiratory symptoms that have been documented to be associated with this infection. However， we should not lose sight of the possibility of coinfection with an-other microorganism in these individuals\n\n【68】The present case report about SARS-CoV-2/MBT coinfection in a 51-year-old taxi driver from Mexico City underscores that， during the COVID-19 pandemic， in areas with a high prevalence of other causes of pneumonia， rapid and accurate assessment with validated molecular diagnostic tests can improve out-comes， even in patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【69】Despite the urgent need to control the COVID-19 pandemic， the medical and scientific community should not forget the other pandemics， such as TB， to which populations are prey. We must remain alert to any clinical subtlety in order ensure that diagnosis is complete and accurate， and to keep one step ahead of SARS-CoV-2.\n\n【70】Acknowledgments\n\n【71】The authors thank Dr. Santillan Segura Francisco Javier and Dr. Ramirez Estrada Edgar Ricardo for their support in review-ing this manuscript.\n\n【72】Department and Institution where work was done\n\n【73】National Institute of Respiratory Diseases， Mexico City， Mexico.\n\n【74】Conflict of interest\n\n【75】None.\n\n【76】1\\.

Refractory hypokalemia can be the present-ing feature in patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome (EAS)， and is seen in up to 80% of cases. EAS can be rap-idly progressive and life-threatening without timely diagnosis and intervention.\n\n【24】Case Report：\n\n【25】We present a case of a 74-year-old White woman who first presented with hypokalemia， refractory to treat-ment with potassium supplementation and spironolactone. She progressively developed generalized weakness， recurrent falls， bleeding peptic ulcer disease， worsening congestive heart failure， and osteoporotic fracture. A laboratory workup showed hypokalemia， hypernatremia， and primary metabolic alkalosis with respiratory aci-dosis. Hormonal evaluation showed elevated ACTH， DHEA-S， 24-h urinary free cortisol， and unsuppressed cor-tisol following an 8 mg dexamethasone suppression test， suggestive of ACTH-dependent CS. CT chest， abdo-men， and pelvis， and FDG/PET CT scan showed a 1.4 cm right lung nodule and bilateral adrenal enlargement， confirming the diagnosis of EAS， with a 1.4-cm lung nodule being the likely source of ectopic ACTH secretion. Due to the patient’s advanced age， comorbid conditions， and inability to attend to further evaluation and treat-ment， her family decided to pursue palliative and hospice care.\n\n【26】Conclusions： This case illustrates that EAS is a challenging condition and requires a multidisciplinary approach in diagnosis and management， which can be very difficult in resource-limited areas. In addition， a delay in diagnosis and management often res ults in rapid deterioration of clinical status.\n\n【27】Keywords： Cushing Syndrome· Endocrine System· Hypokalemia\n\n【28】Abbreviations：\n\n【29】ACTH -adrenocorticotropic hormone； CS -Cushing's syndrome； CT - computed tomography；EAS-ec-topic ACTH syndrome； MRI - magnetic resonance imaging； FDG/PET-18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose posi-tron emission tomography； NET-neuroendocrine tumors； SSTR - somatostatin receptor； EF-ejection fraction； PAC- plasma aldosterone concentration； PRA - plasma renin activity； UFC - urine free corti-sol； DHEA-S - dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate； 58-Ga-DOTATATE - Gallium 68 (68Ga) 1，4，7，10-tetraazacy-clododecane-1，4，7，10-tet-raacetic acid (DOTA)-octreotate； PUD - peptic ulcer disease\n\n【30】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/934437\n\n【31】￥口1995 盟珀1 21\n\n【32】Cushing's syndrome (CS) has a variety of clinical manifesta-tions resulting from excess steroid hormone production from adrenal glands (endogenous) or administration of glucocor-ticoids (exogenous) \\[1，2\\]. Endogenous CS is classified into 2main categories： ACTH-dependent and ACTH-independent dis ease. In ACTH-dependent disease， the source of ACTH can fur-ther be subdivided into either the pituitary gland or an ectopic source \\[2\\]. Ectopic ACTH syndrome (EAS) results from excess production of ACTH from extra-pituitary sources \\[2\\] and ac-counts for approximately 4-5% of cases of CS \\[3，4\\]. Common clinical manifestations of CS include weight gain，central obe-sity， fatigue， plethoric facies， purple striae， hirsutism， irregular menses， hypertension， diabetes/glucose intolerance， anxiety， muscle weakness， bruising， and osteoporosis \\[2\\]. Hypokalemia is a less defining feature， seen in roughly 20% of cases with CS. However， it is present in up to 90% of cases with EAS \\[2，5\\]， which is attributed to the mineralocorticoid action of steroid 6\\].\n\n【33】Hypercortisolism due to EAS is usually severe and rapid in onset， and excess cortisol levels can lead to severe clinical manifesta-tions， including life-threatening infections \\[7\\]. Moreover， in most patients with EAS， the source of excess ACTH is an underlying malignancy that can further result in rapid deterioration of the overall clinical condition. Although numerous malignancies have been associated with EAS， lung neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are the most common \\[2，8\\]. Since the treatment of choice for EAS is complete resection of the tumor， the correct localization of the source of ectopic ACTH is crucial in managing these pa-tients. Traditional radiological investigations can localize these tumors in up to 50% of cases \\[9\\]； however， recent studies uti-lizing somatostatin receptor (SSTR) analogs have increased the sensitivity and specificity of tumor localization \\[9-11\\]. This case report describes a challenging case of an elderly patient with EAS who presented with refractory hypokalemia. Her clinical condi-tion deteriorated rapidly in the absence of surgical intervention.\n\n【34】Case Report\n\n【35】A 74-year-old White woman was brought to the Emergency Department from her nephrologist’s office with a chief concern of persistent anasarca and recurrent hypokalemia of 1-month duration. In addition， she reported generalized weakness and recurrent mechanical falls in the preceding 3 months. Before presentation in March 2021， she had a medical history of type2 diabetes， chronic kidney disease stage 3b， atrial fibrillation on chronic anticoagulation， heart failure with reduced ejec-tion fraction (EF 35-40%)， hypothyroidism， hypertension，and hyperlipidemia. Home medications included diltiazem， apix-aban， insulin glargine， levothyroxine， simvastatin， carvedilol， glimepiride， sacubitril， valsartan， and furosemide.\n\n【36】On presentation， she was hemodynamically stable with tem-perature 36.5℃， heart rate 67 beats per min， blood pressure139/57 mmHg， respiratory rate 20 per min， and saturation 98%on 2 L oxygen supplementation. Her height was 162.6 cm， and weight was 80.88 kg， with a body mass index (BMI) of 30.6kg/m2.A physical exam showed central obesity， bruising in ex-tremities， generalized facial swelling mainly in the periorbital region， severe pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities， and moderate pitting edema in bilateral upper extremities. A labo-ratory workup revealed serum potassium 2.4 mmol/L(3.6-5.2mmol/L)， serum sodium 148 mmol/L (133-144 mmol/L)， and eGFR 31.5 mL/min/1.73 m2. Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.6， PaCO2 48.9 mmHg (35.0-45.0 mmHg)，and serum bi-carbonate 32 mmol/L (22-29 mmol/L)， which was consistent with primary metabolic alkalosis， appropriately compensat-ed by respiratory acidosis. Due to concerns of loop diuretic-induced hypokalemia， she was started on spironolactone and potassium replacement. However， potassium levels persistent-ly remained in the low range of 2-3.5 mmol/L (3.6-5.2 mmol/L) despite confirming compliance to medications and adequate up-titration in the dose of spironolactone and potassium chlo-ride. Hence， the workup for the secondary cause of persistent hypokalemia was pursued.\n\n【37】Hormonal evaluation revealed plasma aldosterone concen-tration (PAC) <1.0 ng/dL， plasma renin activity (PRA) 0.568ng/mL/h (0.167-5.380 ng/mL/h)， 24-h urine free cortisol (UFC)357 mg/24h (6-42 mg/24h)， ACTH 174 pg/mL， and DHEA-S353 ug/dL (20.4-186.6 ug/dL). ACTH levels on 2 repeat test-ings were 229 pg/mL and 342 pg/mL. The rest of the labora-tory workup is summarized in Table 1. Considering elevated ACTH and 24-h UFC， a preliminary diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome was made. An 8-mg dexamethasone sup-pression test revealed non-suppressed cortisol of 62.99 ug/dL along with dexamethasone 4050 ng/dL (1600-2850 ng/dL). A pituitary MRI was unremarkable for any focal lesion suggest-ing a diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome sec-ondary to an ectopic source. Imaging studies were then per-formed to determine the source. A CT scan of the chest and abdomen revealed adenomatous thickening with nodularity of bilateral adrenal glands， and a 1.4-cm nodule in the right middle lobe (Figure 1A， 1B). FDG-PET/CT showed severe bi-lateral enlargement of the adrenal glands with severe hyper-metabolic uptake (mSUV 9.2 and 9.1 for left and right adrenal glands， respectively) (Figure 2A). The uptake of the right lung nodule on PET/CT was 1.4 mSUV (Figure 2B).\n\n【38】Based on unsuppressed cortisol following an 8-mg dexameth-asone suppression test， negative pituitary MRl， and 1.4-cm lung nodule， we diagnosed ACTH-dependent CS secondary to an ectopic source， most likely from the 1.4-cm lung nodule. While awaiting localization studies， within 3 months of initial presentation， she had 2 hospitalizations， one in May 2021 for\n\n| Laboratory test  | Level  | Reference range  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| WBCs  | 7.8k/uL  | 3.7-10.3k/uL  |\n| RBCs  | 3.05M/mL  | 3.-5.2M/mL  |\n| Hemoglobin  | 9.6g/dL  | 11.2-15.7 g/dL  |\n| Hematocrit  | 27.3%  | 34-45%  |\n| Platelets  | 98k/mL  | 155-369 k/mL  |\n| MCV  | 89.7 fl  | 78.2-101.8 fl  |\n| MCH  | 31.5 pg  | 26.4-33.3 pg  |\n| MCHC  | 35.2 g/dL  | 32.5-35.3 g/dL  |\n| RDW  | 15.8%  | 10.1-16.2%  |\n| Glucose  | 73 mg/dL  | 74-90 mg/dL  |\n| Sodium  | 148mmol/L  | 136-145 mmol/L  |\n| Potassium  | 2.4mmol/L  | 3.7-4.8 mmol/L  |\n| Bicarbonate  | 32 mmol/L  | 22-29mmol/L  |\n| Chloride  | 108 mmol/L  | 97-107 mmol/L  |\n| Calcium  | 7.0mg/dL  | 8.9-10.2mg/dL  |\n| Magnesium  | 1.7 mg/dL  | 1.7-2.4mg/dL  |\n| Phosphorus  | 2.3 mg/dL  | 2.5-4.9mg/dL  |\n| Albumin  | 2.4g/dL  | 3.3-4.6 g/dL  |\n| Blood urea nitrogen  | 41 mg/dL  | 0-30 ng/dL  |\n| Creatinine  | 1.60 mg/dL  | 0.60-1.10mg/dL  |\n| Estimated GFR  | 31.5mL/min/  | \\>60mL/min/  |\n| Estimated GFR  | 1.73m²  | 1.73m²  |\n\n| Laboratory test  | Level  | Reference range  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Aspartate transaminase  | 42 U/L  | 9-36 U/L  |\n| Alanine transaminase  | 67 U/L  | 8-33 U/L  |\n| Alkaline phosphatase  | 90 U/L  | 46-142 U/L  |\n| Total protein  | 4.8 g/dL  | 6.3-7.9 g/dL  |\n| Arterial blood gas analysis  |  |  |\n| PaCO2  | 48.9 mmHg  | 35.0-45.0  |\n| PaCO2  | 48.9 mmHg  | mmHg  |\n| Pa02  | 63.1mmHg  | 85.0-100.0  |\n| Pa02  | 63.1mmHg  | mmHg  |\n| %SAT  | 92.8%  | 93.0-97.0  |\n| HCO3  | 47.8mm/L  | 20.0-26.0mm/L  |\n| Base excess  | 26.3mm/L  | <2.0 mm/L  |\n| pH  | 7.599  | 7.350-7.450  |\n| Adrenocorticotropic  | 174， 229 and 342  | 15-65 pg/mL  |\n| hormone (ACTH)  | pg/mL  | 15-65 pg/mL  |\n| Urine free cortisol， 24 h  | 357 ug/24 hr  | 6-42 mg/24 hr  |\n| 8：00 AM cortisol  |  |  |\n| following 8 mg  | 62.99 mg/dL  |  |\n| dexamethasone (4x2  | 62.99 mg/dL  |  |\n| mg doses) previous day  |  |  |\n| 8：00AM  |  |  |\n| dexamethasone  |  |  |\n| following 8 mg  | 4050 ng/dL  | 1600-2850 ng/dL  |\n| dexamethasone (4×2  |  |  |\n| mg doses) previous day  |  |  |\n\n【41】Figure 1.

The patient's overall condition continued to deteriorate， and she became progressively weak and wheelchair-bound.A68-Ga-DOTATATE was planned to establish the source of ecto-pic ACTH definitively； however， she developed a left hip frac-ture in July 2021 and could not present for follow-up care. Therefore， she was started on Mifepristone until curative sur-gery. However， considering the patient's advanced comorbid conditions， the increased burden of the patient’s health care needs on her elderly husband， and the inability of other fam-ily members to provide necessary healthcare-related support， palliative care was pursued. In August 2021， she developed a sacral decubitus ulcer and community-acquired pneumonia. However， she was still alive while receiving palliative care in a nursing home until September 2021.\n\n【44】Discussion\n\n【45】Ectopic ACTH syndrome (EAS) is defined as secretion of ACTH from an extra-pituitary source and is the cause of Cushing's syndrome (CS) in approximately 4-5% of cases \\[3，4\\]. Clinical features of EAS depend on the rate and amount of ACTH pro-duction \\[12\\]. Among all forms of Cushing's (excluding adrenal cortical carcinoma)， EAS has the worst outcome， with one of the most extensive combined UK & Athens study demonstrating a5-year survival rate of 77.6%. Compared to Cushing's disease(CD)， patients with EAS have severe and excessive production of ACTH， resulting in highly elevated cortisol levels. This leads to hypokalemia， metabolic alkalosis， worsening glycemia， hy-pertension， psychosis，and infections. Metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia are the 2 most common acid-base and electrolyte\n\n【46】abnormalities associated with glucocorticoid excess among these patients. Studies have shown that hypokalemia is seen in up to90% of patients with EAS. Although hypertension and hypoka-lemia are often attributed to primary hyperaldosteronism， oth-er causes should be sought. Under normal circumstances， the mineralocorticoid effect of cortisol is insignificant due to local conversion to cortisone by the action of 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.Excessive cortisol in patients with EAS saturates the action of 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and leads to the appearance of mineralocorticoid action of cortisol \\[6\\]. In our patient， the initial treatment of hypokalemia was unsatis-factory， so additional endocrine workup was pursued. Elevated urinary cortisol excretion， plasma ACTH levels， unsuppressed cortisol following 8 mg dexamethasone， and lung mass on CT scan strongly suggested that the clinical symptoms were due to EAS. Unfortunately， despite diagnosing the underlying con-dition contributing to the patient's symptoms， her clinical con-dition rapidly deteriorated without surgical treatment.\n\n【47】Various factors resulted in delayed diagnosis in our patient. First， the patient sought medical care only 3 months after symptom onset. Second， furosemide， a medication common-ly used to treat patients with HFrEF， is a frequent culprit of hypokalemia and often is treated with adequate potassium supplementation. Third， multiple hospitalizations resulted in delays in the proper endocrine workup necessary for establish-ing hypercortisolism. Fourth， localization of the ectopic source requires advanced imaging studies， which are only available in a few tertiary care centers. Fifth， even after tumor localiza-tion with PET/CT scan， there is still a need for a more defin-itive localization study using Ga-DOTATATE scan， which has a higher specificity. However， it was unavailable in our insti-tution and was only available in a few tertiary care centers， with the nearest center being 2.5 h away. Sixth， the impact of\n\n【48】the COVID-19 pandemic also played a critical role in prompt-ly providing critical care necessary to the patient. In addition to those， the social situation of our patient also played an es-sential role in contributing to delays in diagnosis.\n\n【49】It is well recognized that EAS is associated with various malig-nancies， mostly of neuroendocrine origin. The most common location of these tumors was found to be the lung (55.3%)， followed by the pancreas (8.5%)， mediastinum-thymus (7.9%)， adrenal glands (6.4%)， and gastrointestinal tract (5.4%)\\[9\\]. Prompt surgical removal of ectopic ACTH-secreting tumors is the mainstay of therapy in patients with EAS \\[13\\]. However， localization of such tumors with conventional therapy is often challenging as the sensitivity to localize the tumor is 50-60%for conventional imaging such as CT， MRI， and FDG-PET\\[9\\]. In a study by Isidori et al， nuclear imaging improved the sensi-tivity of conventional radiological imaging \\[9\\]. Moreover， new-er imaging technologies using somatostatin receptor (SSTR) analogs such as 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT further improve the ability to localize the tumor. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT， approved in 2016 by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for imaging well-differentiated NETs， has a high sensitivity (88-93%) and specificity (88-95%) to diagnose carcinoid tumor \\[14\\]； how-ever， a systematic review reported a significantly lower sensi-tivity (76.1%) of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT to diagnose EAS \\[15\\].\n\n【50】Once localized， the optimal management of EAS is surgical re-section of the causative tumor， which is often curative. However， until curative surgery is done， patients should be medically managed. Drugs used to reduce cortisol levels include ketocon-azole， mitotane， and metyrapone \\[16， 17\\]. These are oral med-ications and decrease cortisol synthesis by inhibiting adrenal enzymes \\[17\\]. Etomidate is the only intravenous drug that im-mediately reduces adrenal steroid production and can be used when acute reduction in cortisol production is desired \\[16\\].\n\n【51】Medical management requires frequent monitoring of corti-sol levels and titration of dose to achieve low serum and urine\n\n【52】References：\n\n【53】1\\.

Mifepristone， an anti-progesterone at a higher dose， works as a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist and can be used to block the action of cortisol. Its use results in vari-able levels of ACTH and cortiso! levels in patients with EAS. Hence， hormonal measurement cannot be used to judge thera peutic response， and clinical improvement is the goal of treat-ment \\[18\\]. Drugs inhibiting ACTH secretion by NETs such as kinase inhibitors (vandetanib， sorafenib， or sunitinib) are effec-tive in treating EAS secondary to medullary thyroid cancer \\[19\\]. Somatostatin analogs such as octreotide and lanreotide have demonstrated short- and medium-term efficacy in a few EAS patients； however， a few patients failed to improve， necessitat-ing the use of more effective treatment options \\[19，20\\]. Hence， they are not considered a first-line drug as monotherapy and should be used in combination with other agents， or as anti-tumoral therapy in non-excisable metastatic well-differentiat-ed NETs \\[19，20\\]. Cabergoline， a dopamine agonist， has been used with variable therapeutic effects in a few patients \\[19\\]. In1 patient， the use of combination therapy using Mifepristone and a long-acting octreotide significantly improved EAS \\[21\\]. In our patient， we initiated Mifepristone to reduce the burden associated with frequent biochemical monitoring and planned68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT to localize the tumor； however， fur-ther diagnostic and therapeutic approaches could not be fur-ther undertaken per family wishes.\n\n【62】Conclusions\n\n【63】EAS can present with refractory hypokalemia， especially in patients who are already at risk of developing hypokalemia. Diagnosis of EAS is often challenging and requires a multidisci-plinary approach. Localization of source of EAS should be done using nuclear imaging， preferably using SSTR analogs， when available. Urgent surgical evaluation remains the mainstay of treatment following tumor localization and can result in a cure. EAS is a rapidly progressive and life-threatening situation that can be fatal if diagnosis or timely intervention is delayed.\n\n【64】7\\. Sarlis NJ， Chanock SJ， Nieman LK.

In devel-oped countries， obstruction of the common bile duct by stones(38%) and alcohol abuse (36%) are the most frequent causes of acute pancreatitis \\[1，2\\]. When they are not identified as the source， practitioners must remember to take a detailed med-ication history. Drug-induced pancreatitis has recently gained more attention and as a result， physicians are screening more frequently for medications as a cause of acute pancreatitis. We describe the case of a patient with a significant past medical history of coronary artery disease， sleep apnea， and gastro-esophageal reflux disease， who developed acute pancreatitis after recently starting furosemide.\n\n【26】Case Report\n\n【27】A 74-year-old man with a significant past medical history for coronary artery disease， sleep apnea， and gastroesophageal reflux disease presented with epigastric pain radiating to the back. Upon admission， the pain was described as 7-out-of-10in severity， with no relieving or exacerbating factors. The onset of pain began the morning of admission. The patient attempt-ed to relieve the pain by going for a mile-and-half walk with his wife. The pain persisted and that prompted the patient to visit the Emergency Department. The patient was slightly nau-seated with no emesis. The patient denied any palpitations， shortness of breath， constipation， diarrhea， or recent weight changes. He is a lifetime non-smoker and non-alcoholic drink-er. When questioned about recent changes in medications， fu-rosemide had been added approximately 6 weeks prior for bi-lateral lower-extremity swelling. The patient has never been diagnosed with congestive heart failure. Vital signs upon ad-mission 158/80 mm Hg， heart rate of 64 beats per minute， re-spiratory rate 18 breaths per minute， and afebrile. Inspection of the abdomen showed no Grey Turner or Cullen sign. On aus-cultation， normoactive bowel sounds were present. Abdominal palpation revealed epigastric tenderness. A complete metabol-ic panel revealed glucose of 104 mg/dL triglyceride level 80mg/dL Renal function (BUN/Cr) was within normal limits. Liver chemistry was within normal limits. Serum amylase (1022 U/L) and lipase levels (>600 U/L) were both elevated. Ultrasound showed satisfactory appearance of the liver， gallbladder， dis-tal common bile duct， spleen， and kidneys. The pancreas was suboptimally visualized due to overlying intestinal gas. A chest x-ray with 2 views showed no acute process. We proceeded with treatment of l fluid hydration and keeping the patient nil per os for 24 h. This case had a positive outcome with the patient regressing in symptoms 24 h after treatment and with-drawal of furosemide.\n\n【28】Our patient presented with symptoms of acute pancreatitis after adding furosemide 6 weeks prior for bilateral lower-ex-tremity swelling. The Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale of 5 suggests a probable medication source of his acute pancreatitis \\[3\\]. No other medication changes were present within the last few years， narrowing our differential to furo-semide-induced pancreatitis. Although acid-suppressing drugs(H，-antagonists or proton-pump inhibitors) and gastroesoph-ageal reflux disease are risk factors for acute pancreatitis \\[4\\]， we felt that the addition of a new drug (furosemide) was more likely the cause of the acute pancreatitis versus a medication that the patient had been taking consistently for many years.\n\n【29】We ruled out the 2 most common causes of acute pancreati-tis -alcohol and gallstones-through the patient's history as a lifetime non-alcoholic drinker and ultrasound findings show-ing no gallstones. Our patient presented with a triglyceride lev-el of 80 mg/dL， ruling out triglyceride as a source. According to the ACG， if triglycerides are greater than 1000 mg/dl，then it should be considered the etiology in the absence of gall-stones or alcoholism \\[5\\]. In accordance with the ACG guide-lines in the Management of Acute Pancreatitis， a contrast-en-hanced computed tomographic and/or magnetic resonance imaging of the pancreas was not ordered because the diag nosis of acute pancreatitis was made based on the patient's clinical presentation and clinical improvement \\[5\\]. However， because these imaging modalities were not ordered， a non-functional PNET cannot be completely ruled out. The diagnosis of a nonfunctional PNET was much lower on our list of differ-entials because of the absence of symptoms such as jaundice， and unintentional weight loss. The diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) also cannot be ruled out， but we did not or-der IgG4. In the absence of painless jaundice， along with lack of involvement of salivary gland and lungs， this was a diagno-sis that was lower on our list of differentials.\n\n【30】Gallstones and chronic alcohol abuse induce the majority(>90%) of acute pancreatitis. The true incidence is unknown since there are few population-based studies available \\[6\\]. The majority of information we have on drug-induced pancreatitis is extrapolated from case reports such as this one. Idiopathic acute pancreatitis accounts for up to 20% of cases and the ar-gument can be made that some drug-induced cases are unfor-tunately misclassified as idiopathic. Drug-induced pancreatitis is rare， with an estimated incidence rate of 0.1-2%\\[7\\]. In a ret-rospective Medline search to assess clinical outcomes of posi-tive drug rechallenge following possible drug-induced pancreati-tis， 250 cases of drug-induced pancreatitis were identified \\[7\\]. Of these， we analyzed and reviewed 183 cases with a posi-tive rechallenge. The total number of furosemide cases was 3， which accounts for 1.6% of the total number of analyzed cases.\n\n【31】Furosemide-induced pancreatitis has been suggested to in-duce acute pancreatitis by impairing pancreatic perfusion \\[8\\] by a decrease in extracellular fluid volume \\[9\\]. The susceptibil-ity of ischemia due to vessel atherosclerosis was increased in our patient because of the past medical history of coronary ar-tery disease. Other proposed mechanisms are pancreatic exo-crine stimulation by furosemide， hypersensitivity from an im-munologic response， or a direct toxic effect to the pancreas \\[9\\].\n\n【32】Latency of furosemide-induced acute pancreatitis ranges from several hours up to 7 weeks \\[10\\]. Latency was categorized by Chao et al. as short (<24h)， intermediate (1 day to 1 month)， and long (>1 month) term. Dosage plays a role in proposed mechanisms of furosemide-induced acute pancreatitis divided into low-dosage and high-dosage \\[10\\]. Our patient falls into the category of long-term latency (6 weeks) and low-dosage(40 mg). The proposed mechanism of acute pancreatitis sug-gested by lones and Oelbaum \\[11\\] and Juang et al.\\[12\\] propose these cases are best explained by hypersensitivity reactions.\n\n【33】References：\n\n【34】1\\.

This article presents a case report and literature review of this entity.\n\n【5】KEYWORDS haemorrhagic cholecystitis， intraperitoneal haemorrhage， anticoagulation， laparotomy\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Haemorrhagic cholecystitis is rare， and gallbladder perforation with massive intraperitoneal bleeding is an even rarer complica-tion. In the last decade， only 14 cases of this phenomenon has been described in English literature. Increasing awareness of this potentially fatal condition is critical. We present a case of haemorrhagic cholecystitis with catastrophic bleeding that was managed by emergent laparotomy and cholecystectomy.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 76-year-old man with a history significant for hypertension， dyslipidaemia， smoking and osteoarthritis underwent an elec-tive right total hip replacement. Two weeks later he was found to have right leg deep vein thromboses， for which apixaban was commenced. After five days， the patient developed worsening abdominal pain associated with vomiting. In the subsequent hours， he became shocked with a systolic blood pressure of 60mmHg and tachycardia up to 120 beats per minute. Clinically\n\n【10】he had increasing abdominal tenderness and distension， and altered level of consciousness.\n\n【11】Laboratory workup showed a haemoglobin drop from 124to 92 g/L， leukocytosis of 21.1x10/L， and an international nor-malised ratio of 1.7. The patient also had new derangement in liver function， with a bilirubin of 57 g/L， alkaline phosphatase of 315 U/L， gamma-glutamyl transferase of 608 U/L， alanine transaminase of 803 U/L， and aspartate transaminase of 1180U/L. Bedside ultrasound demonstrated free intraabdominal fluid. Urgent abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed large-volume haemoperitoneum extending from the gallbladder fossa to Morison’s pouch and tracking down the right paracolic gutter and pelvis. There was active arterial extravasation in the gallbladder fossa， with a possible feeding artery arising from the right hepatic or cystic artery. The gallbladder itself was difficult to assess but cholelithiasis was noted (Fig 1).\n\n【12】The patient was transfused packed red cells， and coagulopa-thy was corrected with tranexamic acid， prothrombinex and fresh frozen plasma. The haemorrhage was deemed unamenable to angioembolisation， hence the patient proceeded to emergency laparotomy. Intraoperatively， large-volume blood was found surrounding a perforated gallbladder. Clot was also identified within the lumen of the gallbladder， thought possibly to arise from an ulcer or erosion related to cholelithiasis (Fig 2). The cystic artery appeared normal. Cholecystectomy was performed， and haemostasis was achieved.\n\n【13】Histologically， the gallbladder showed features of subacute\n\n【14】Figure 1 Computed tomography of abdomen and pelvis in the arterial phase.

Haemoperitoneum measuring 74x76mm collecting in Morison's pouch arising from gallbladder fossa， with further perihepatic and right paracolic blood ((c) coronal).

Bleeding appeared to arise from erosion of the mucosal surface (b).\n\n【16】on chronic cholecystitis， with haemorrhagic disruption of the submucosa and muscularis. Intraluminal and serosal haemor-rhages were noted. Interestingly， some sections showed eccentric fibrinoid necrosis affecting submucosal arteries， suggesting an underlying arteritis.\n\n【17】The patient made an uncomplicated recovery， and apixaban was recommenced on the second postoperative day. He was completely well on subsequent follow-up at six months.\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】The pathophysiology of haemorrhagic cholecystitis is thought to involve cholelithiasis eroding the cystic artery causing pseu-\n\n【20】doaneurysm formation. Intraluminal bleeding from this pseu-doaneurysm， in combination with cystic duct obstruction， leads to rupture of the hyper- pressurised gallbladder \\[1\\]. Alterna-tively， acute cholecystitis with perforation and bleeding from the gallbladder wall defect may be another mechanism of intraperi-toneal haemorrhage. Both transhepatic perforation and free rupture into the peritoneal cavity can lead to massive haemoperi-toneum \\[2\\].\n\n【21】This case was associated with the recent commencement of apixaban， supporting anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy as the major risk factor for haemorrhagic cholecystitis and its com-plications \\[1， 2\\]. Patients with underlying bleeding diatheses also appear to be at higher risk \\[3， 4\\]. Interestingly， our histological findings suggest that an underlying vasculitis may be another predisposing factor. Cases of haemorrhagic cholecystitis associ-ated with microscopic polyangiitis and Churg-Strauss syndrome have been reported， though none had massive intraperitoneal haemorrhage \\[5，6\\].\n\n【22】Early recognition of this potentially fatal condition is crucial but challenging. Its presentation resembles that of acute calcu-lous cholecystitis， with abdominal pain and nausea or vomiting predominating. Haemobilia and melaena may be more specific signs of haemorrhagic cholecystitis \\[7\\]. The obstructive liver function tests in our case suggest that relative biliary obstruction with haemobilia may have been present. Other supportive labo-ratory findings include acute anaemia and leucocytosis \\[1-3，7\\]. The development of hypovolaemic shock should raise concern for massive intraperitoneal haemorrhage.\n\n【23】Imaging is usually diagnostic. While ultrasound is the first-line imaging modality for acute cholecystitis， patients present-ing with gallbladder perforation and massive intraperitoneal haemorrhage almost invariably proceed to a contrast-enhanced CT scan. Our case had typical CT findings， with large-volume haemoperitoneum surrounding the gallbladder fossa， and active contrast extravasation \\[1， 3， 4， 7\\]. Cystic artery pseudoaneurysm is reportedly a specific sign \\[1\\]， and disruption of the gallbladder wall may also be seen \\[2，8\\].\n\n【24】Definitive management of haemorrhagic cholecystitis is chole-cystectomy. Most patients with massive intraperitoneal haemor-rhage undergo laparotomy like in our case， but a laparoscopic approach appears feasible in the appropriately selected patient\\[9\\].\n\n【25】Increasingly， there is a trend toward a two-step approach of embolisation of the culprit vessel prior to cholecystectomy \\[1，8\\]. However， our case shows that immediate surgical intervention， without the benefits of angioembolisation， may be necessary.\n\n【26】Conclusion\n\n【27】Haemorrhagic cholecystitis is an under-recognised phenomenon that can lead to significant morbidity or mortality. In a patient who presents clinically with acute cholecystitis， the develop-ment of haemodynamic instability， particularly in the setting of anticoagulation use should trigger suspicion of massive in-traperitoneal bleeding. While CT imaging can help identify a target for angioembolisation， the clinician should be mindful that immediate surgical intervention may still be required.\n\n【28】Consent For Publication\n\n【29】Informed consent was obtained for publication of this case report and its associated images.\n\n【30】Funding\n\n【31】This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in public， commercial， or not-for-profit sectors.\n\n【32】Conflict of Interest\n\n【33】The authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n\n【34】Authors'Contribution\n\n【35】JY was responsible for the literature review and drafting of the case report.

Proper position of driver/passenger is a\n\n【10】necessary condition when using safety belts. We describe a case of cervical spine injury caused by improper use\n\n【11】of safety belts and tilted seat.\n\n【12】Case report： At the moment of car crash， when the seat was tilted back and the safety belts were on， the victim\n\n【13】was propelled forward， thus 'slipping'underneath the lap part of the belt towards the floor of the car. Then， the\n\n【14】shoulder part of the safety belt was blocked at the level ofneck， causing damage to spinal ligaments and tear of\n\n【15】spinal cord.\n\n【16】Conclusions： Upon car crash， misuse of safety belts and/or improper position of seats may result in equally\n\n【17】severe injuries as while driving without safety belts. Only proper position of car seats and appropriate use of\n\n【18】safety belts may lead to reduction of car crash-related harm and better survival.\n\n【19】The first vehicle to move under its own power for which there is a record was designed by Nicholas Joseph Cugnot and constructed by M. Brezin in 1769. However， only a century later， in 1885， the German constructor Gottlieb Daimler designed a wooden motorcycle with a hot tube ignition system. The very first cars raised both curiosity and horror. English authorities in 1865 issued a law requiring a person walking (not running) with red flag at least 60 yards before the car thus giving notice to the others. The accepted speed of so called ‘street locomotives' was restricted to 4 miles per hour. Despite these precau-tions a 44-year-old woman was hit by a car and was recorded as the very first victim in England in 1896 \\[1\\].\n\n【20】The development of automotive industry was fol-lowed by increase of injury rates in drivers and pas-sengers. First seat belts were designed in 1903 to pre-vent the passenger from falling down onto the cobble stone streets； however， only 40 years later the seat belts were designed to increase safety. Initially they were 2-point， lap belts with complicated fastening system. The main disadvantage of that type of seat\n\n【21】belts was inevitable head injury during collision - the passenger usually hit the steering wheel or dash board. These injuries were accompanied by blunt abdominal trauma caused by lap belt \\[2\\]\n\n【22】The modern type of 3-point seat belts (the lap and diagonal parts) were introduced in 1959. They are designed for adult drivers and passengers. These belts take over the kinetic energy of the driver’s or passen-ger's body and transfer it into the body of the car. The energy generated by an adult weighing 80 kg at 50 km per hour after collision against a solid roadblock is estimated for approximately 2 tones. By absorbing心that energy， the belts prevent the passenger from ejec tion from the vehicle (catapulting) on sudden impact. Some of them contain pyrotechnic pretensioners that make them fitted properly during a car crash.\n\n【23】A proper positioning of the car seat is required t make the seat belts work properly. The vertical part of the seat must be placed in almost vertical position.\n\n【24】Figure 1. C-spine X-ray- lateral view： injury at the C5/C6 disc level. The sixth cervical vertebra is invisible due to cephalad dis-placement of the upper fragment of the cervical spine.\n\n【25】Figure 3. Chest CT scan： significant widening of the mediastinum caused by bleeding. Blood shown also in the right pleural cavity.\n\n【26】The diagonal belt should go from the hip to the shoulder over the collarbone but without pressing the clavicle. The belt should be anchored to the body of the car at the level of the passenger’s ears. The belt must not be twisted or damaged.\n\n【27】CASE REPORT\n\n【28】A 27-year-old woman was a front-seat passenger of the car that had hit the tree. According to the physi-cian from the ambulance the vertical part of her seat was tilted backwards. Her head was tilted backwards and her chin was pushed by the diagonal part of her\n\n【29】AKDZ\n\n【30】HC\n\n【31】Figure 2.

Blood present in the spinal cord， spinal canal and peri-spinal soft tissues.\n\n【32】seat belt. She immediately got a cervical collar and got extricated from the wreck. A cardiac arrest has been recognized. An oro-tracheal intubation and a standard resuscitation was performed with a success. The addi tional findings included： multiple skin abrasions， edema of the soft tissues in the neck， subcutaneous haematoma of the right side of the neck and quadri plegia with preserved mimic function of the facial muscles. The patient was deeply unconscious， without own respiratory drive. The arterial blood pressure was maintained by infusion of increasing doses of cate-cholamines (dopamine， noradrenaline). On the route to hospital the infusion of methylprednisolone at a ini-\n\n【33】tial dose of 30 mg/kg has been started. This was fol-lowed by continuous infusion of methylprednisolone according the standard protocol at the hospital.\n\n【34】The cervical X-rays and MRI showed a 3 cm-long broken bony architecture of the cervical spine(Figure 1，2) with torn cervical spinal cord. Head CT-scan disclosed the obstructed cerebral basal cisterns and narrowed ventricular system caused by severe brain edema. Chest CT revealed a significant widen-ing of the mediastinum caused by the presence of haematoma (Figure 3). Contrast medium CT did not reveal any traumatic injury to aorta. Ultrasound of the neck and color Doppler ultrasound of the carotid arteries disclosed soft tissue edema with small cis-terns of extravasated blood. Both carotid arteries revealed increased intracranial vascular flow resis-tance. Color Doppler ultrasound failed to show the blood flow in the vertebral arteries.\n\n【35】Despite aggressive treatment the patient died after11 hours of hospitalization.\n\n【36】DISCUSSION\n\n【37】Head and cervical spine injury are main causes of death and disability following motor vehicle acci-dents \\[3\\]. Introduction of the seat belt law signifi-cantly increased survival in victims of MVAs. Sasso et al. studied the relation between seat-belt use and neurological injury in the 1352 patients who had spinal injuries as the result of motor vehicle crashes and found that 86% of the victims were unbelted \\[4\\]. Another study proved that better prognosis was found in patients with cervical spine and cervical cord injury who were belted on impact \\[5\\].\n\n【38】Similar results were found for blunt abdominal trau-ma in children injured in car crashes. The benefits of protection provided by seat belts were underlined along with the timely CT scan-based diagnosis \\[6\\].\n\n【39】The proper management on site is essential - cervi-cal spine immobilization in every patient with neck or back pain， neurological signs of spinal cord injury and altered level of consciousness， avoiding any unnecessary movements of the spine. The detailed description of mechanism of injury allows evaluation of possible multi-organ injury \\[7\\].\n\n【40】Application of seat belts decreases the risk of severe injury following the car crash. There is no seat belt law for pregnant women so far. However， the analy-sis of statistics of motor vehicle accidents revealed lower risk of injury to the properly belted pregnant\n\n【41】woman and fetus when compared to injuries caused by sudden deceleration during braking or car crash. Fetal injury rates resulting from the injuries in utero caused by increased seat belt pressure are extremely rare-1 per 10 000 car crashes \\[2\\].\n\n【42】Improper seat belt use may increase the severity of injury. The proper positions of the driver and passen-gers are necessary for the proper protection provided by seat belts. In the described case the mechanism of the injury seems to be obvious. With the vertical part of the seat tilted backwards and seat belts fastened. the victim's body ‘dived' under the lap belt during deceleration， while the shoulder belt blocked the neck and caused the injury to spinal ligaments and damage to spinal cord.\n\n【43】The presented case underlines the need for the prop-er positioning of seat belts and the risk associated with the seat belt misuse. During motor vehicle acci-dent improperly fastened seat belts or wrong posi-tion of the seat itself with the seat belts fastened may lead to equally severe injuries as in cases without use of safety belts.\n\n【44】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【45】1\\. Improper use of seat belts may cause severe injury during motor vehicle accidents.\n\n【46】2\\. Only the proper positioning of the seat itself and fastened， properly working safety belts may decrease the effects of the crash and save lives of the car occupants.\n\n【47】REFERENCES：\n\n【48】1\\.

In these patients steroids might precipitate or exacerbate asthma. Apart from worsening of asthma， se-rious complications like hyperinfection syndrome and even death can occur in these patients if treated with steroids. Treatment is either ivermectin or albendazole based on severity of the disease. Clinicians have to be very careful when prescribing steroids in patients presenting with an exacerbation of asthma from areas en-\n\n【24】demic for Strongyloides stercoralis.\n\n【25】Case Report：\n\n【26】A young woman with history of asthma presented with complaints of nausea， vomiting， abdominal pain， wheez-ing， and dry cough. Physical examination revealed diffuse expiratory wheezing and mild diffuse abdominal pain without rebound or guarding. Laboratory results showed leukocytosis with eosinophilia. Stool studies showed Strongyloides stercoralis. Imaging revealed ground-glass opacities in the right upper and lower lobe along with an infiltrate in the lingular lobe on the left side. Bronchoscopy showed Strongytoides stercoratis. The patient was diagnosed with hyperinfection syndrome due to Strongyloides stercoralis most probably exacerbated by prednisone given for her asthma. Steroids were then discontinued and the patient was started on ivermectin. The patient improved with treatment. Repeat stool examination was negative for Strongytoides stercoralis.\n\n【27】Conclusions：\n\n【28】Clinicians have to be very careful when prescribing steroids in patients presenting with an exacerbation of asthma who are from areas endemic for Strongyloides stercoralis and should test for it (preferably with serol-ogy test) before starting treatment.\n\n【29】MeSH Keywords： Asthma · Prednisone · Strongyloides\n\n【30】Full-text PDF http：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/893729\n\n【31】口17726 H 3 日 11\n\n【32】Background\n\n【33】Corticosteroids are the cornerstone of management for asthma， and usually the response to treatment is excellent. However， steroids might precipitate or exacerbate asthma， which could be life-threatening， in patients infected with a parasite -Strongyloides stercoralis (SS) seen in certain parts of the USA and in people from other endemic areas. Most patients with SS infection of are asymptomatic with eosinophilia， thus a good history and high index of suspicion are needed to help prevent this catastrophic complication. We report a case in which timely diagnosis may have saved a young woman from a poor outcome.\n\n【34】Case Report\n\n【35】A 31-year-old Hispanic woman with history of asthma， who emigrated from Mexico at age 14， presented with complaints of nausea， vomiting， abdominal pain， wheezing， and dry cough. She had recently been treated for asthma exacerbation with prednisone and was still taking it. She denied any occupation-al exposure， pets， smoking， and recent travel. Vital signs were：temperature 101°F， pulse 106/min， blood pressure 112/72mmHg， and respiratory rate 22/min. Systemic examination\n\n【36】Figure 1. Chest X-ray showing left lung opacity.\n\n【37】Figure 2. CT chest showing left lingular lobe infiltrate.\n\n【38】revealed diffuse expiratory wheezing and mild diffuse ab-dominal pain without rebound or guarding. Laboratory re-sults showed leukocytosis (11 900/mm) with eosinophilia(32.2%)， negative drug screen， and negative rapid HIV test. Stool studies showed SS. Chest X-ray showed opacity in the left lung (Figure 1). CT chest revealed ground-glass opacities in the right upper and lower lobe along with an infiltrate in the lingular lobe on the left side (Figure 2). Blood cultures were positive for Escherichia coli. The patient was diagnosed with hyperinfection syndrome due to SS， most probably ex-acerbated by prednisone given for her asthma. Steroids were then discontinued， and the patient was started on ivermec-tin， broad-spectrum antibiotics， and intensive bronchodilator therapy. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) I/ll quantita-tive Ab were negative. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar la-vage (BAL) was done to rule out other infectious causes of the lung infiltrate. The cytological examination of BAL showed lar-vae of SS (Figure 3A， 3B). The patient was started on ivermec-tin along with antibiotics for her E. coli bacteremia. Ivermectin was given until her repeat stool examination was negative for SS for 2 weeks (she received it for a total of 17 days). She im-proved with treatment.\n\n【39】Figure 3. (A， B) BAL showing larvae of Strongyloides stercoralis.\n\n【40】Strongyloidiasis is an infection caused by SS. This disease can be seen in the southeastern United States and in immigrants from endemic areas. Patients may not experience prominent symptoms but when they do they most commonly involve the gastrointestinal， cutaneous， and /or pulmonary systems.\n\n【41】Pulmonary symptoms may include dry cough， shortness of breath， wheezing，and hemoptysis. Features suggestive of re-current bacterial pneumonia are common in these patients. They may also develop asthma，which paradoxically worsens with corticosteroid use \\[1，2\\]. Apart from worsening of asthma， serious complications and death can occur in these patients treated with steroids \\[3，4\\]. Gram-negative sepsis is also com-monly seen in patients with SS. Hyperinfection syndrome is a severe form of SS， occurring most probably due to repeated autoinfection leading to increased parasite burden and some-times precipitated by steroid therapy \\[4\\]. It has a mortality rate of from 10% to over 80%.\n\n【42】Diagnosis is based on active investigation of the parasite by identification of the larvae in the stool， and a high index of suspicion should be maintained， especially in immunocompro-mised patients. Standard stool examination is very insensitive for detecting SS. Three specialized tests are recommended：\n\n【43】References：\n\n【44】1\\.

It was first described by Holmes and Panje \\[6\\] in 1983 as \"intranasal granuloma fa-ciale\". The histopathology of EAF typically involves concentric fibrosis surrounding arterioles， and the presence of numerous eosinophils \\[2\\]. In 1985， Roberts and McCann \\[7\\] described 3similar cases and coined the histologically descriptive name \\[2\\]. There is no established treatment for EAF， but commonly used treatments include surgical resection， systemic and topical cor-ticosteroids， and a combination of these 2 methods \\[2\\]. It has also been reported that rituximab improved serology test re-sults and the lesions in a few cases of EAF.\n\n【22】To date， 78 cases of EAF have been reported in the scientif-ic literature worldwide， including 61 in the nasal cavity， 23 in the paranasal sinus， 13 in the orbit， 4 in the respiratory tract，3 in the lacrimal gland， 1 in the gingiva， and 1 behind the or-bit \\[2，8-14\\]. Notably， however， no cases of EAF in the eyelid conjunctiva have ever been reported. Herein， we describe a case of bilateral EAF involving the upper eyelid conjunctivas.\n\n【23】Case Report\n\n【24】The patient was a 55-year-old Japanese woman with a history of sinusitis who had undergone endoscopic resection 2 years prior and was histologically diagnosed with eosinophilic sinus-itis. Six months later， she exhibited bilateral upper eyelid con-junctival swelling without pain. The lesions were resistant to treatment with 0.05% epinastine hydrochloride ophthalmic so-lution (ALESION@， Santen Pharmaceutical， Osaka， Japan)， 0.1%fluorometholone ophthalmic suspension (Flumetholon@， Santen Pharmaceutical， Osaka， Japan)， and 0.1% tacrolimus ophthal-mic suspension (TALYMUS@， Senju Pharmaceutical Co.，Osaka， Japan) 4 times a day， so she was referred to our outpatient\n\n【25】clinic. The preoperative appearances of the conjunctival up-per eyelids are shown in Figure 1.\n\n【26】The patient had a history of eosinophilic sinusitis but no his-tory of drug allergies. The results of routine blood examina-tions and blood biochemistry were all within normal ranges. Levels of total IgG and other subtypes were normal， with the exception of serum lgG4， which was 179 mg/dL (normal range11-121 mg/dL). Other autoimmune screening tests， including anti-Sjogren's syndrome A antibody， anti-Sjogren's syndrome B antibody， anti-PR3 antibody， anti-myeloperoxidase antibody， and antinuclear body， were all negative (Table 1). Magnetic res-onance imaging of the head did not reveal any major compli-cations or swelling in the lacrimal gland， salivary gland， or in-fraorbital nerve (Figure 2).\n\n【27】Treatment and follow-up\n\n【28】The patient underwent surgical resection without complications(Figure 3) and was treated with fluorometholone eye drop 4times a day. Her postoperative course was uneventful. She was followed up every 2 months for approximately 6 months， dur-ing which there was no evidence of recurrence of the disease.\n\n【29】Pathologic findings\n\n【30】The specimens resected from both eyelid conjunctivas were characterized by hard lesions with a homogeneous yellowish-white solid and a macroscopically rough surface. Histological examination of the conjunctival mucosa showed marked chron-ic inflammation of submucosa and stromal fibrosis (Figure 4). The inflammatory infiltrate was composed of mature lympho-cytes， plasma cells， and numerous eosinophils (Figure 5A). The conjunctival epithelium was characterized by the irreg-ular growth of limbal epithelial cells due to inflammation. The stromal fibrosis showed concentric lamellar deposition of collagen/onion-skin-like appearance with scattered eo-sinophils around the blood vessels and focal storiform fibro-sis (Figure 5B). There was no true granulomatous reaction，\n\n【31】Table 1.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head， indicating that the lacrimal gland， salivary gland， and infraorbital nerve were intact.\n\n【38】cytologic atypia， or mitotic activity. Immunohistochemical staining for lgG4 showed that 68 plasma cells were positive for the IgG4/high-power field， and the IgG4/IgG ratio was 45%(Patholoscope， Mitani Co.). These findings are consistent with\n\n【39】IgG4-related diseases， which increase the number of IgG4-positive plasma cells and the lgG4/lgG ratio (Table 2). These histological features， such as eosinophilic vasculitis and an-giocentric fibrosis with the onion-skin pattern， led us to diag-nose this case as eosinophilic angiocentric fibrosis. In addition， fibrosis was pronounced in the left-side lesions， suggesting a more advanced stage.\n\n【40】Discussion\n\n【41】EAF is considered a benign disorder， and the diagnosis of EAF is based on histopathological findings characterized by inflam-matory infiltration of eosinophils， fibrotic bundles around ves-sels， and an onion-skin pattern accompanied by fibrotic stro-ma \\[7，15\\]. These characteristic changes were evident in the present case. Seventy-eight cases of EAF have been described to date \\[2，8-14\\]， and while the involvement of “neoplasms”or“inflammatory lesions\" has been variously described， the exact pathology of EAF remains unclear. In the present case， fibrous inflammatory lesions were observed in the absence of any in-dications of malignancy.\n\n【42】Figure 3. Postoperative observations in the upper eyelid conjunctivas. (A) Right and (B) left upper eyelid conjunctivas 2 months after surgery. Fibrotic lesions were surgically resected in both eyes.\n\n【43】Figure 4. Histopathology image of a tissue sample from the upper conjunctiva of the left eye (hematoxylin and eosin staining，x40 magnification). Infiltration of numerous inflammatory cells and fibrous connective tissue are evident.\n\n【44】During the early phase of EAF， the lesion consists of eosinophil-ic vasculitis with a mixture of lymphocytes and plasma cells. Inflammatory infiltration gradually becomes hypocellular， with increasing fibrosis \\[15\\]. The late phase of EAF is characterized by dense fibrous thickening of the stroma and perivascular onion-skin fibrotic changes \\[15\\]. Histopathological findings typical of\n\n【45】Figure 5. Histopathology images of tissue samples from the upper conjunctiva of the left eye (hematoxylin and eosin staining， x200 magnification). (A) Inflammatory infiltration composed of mature eosinophils， lymphocytes， and plasma cells.\n\n【46】both early phase (Figure 5A) and late phase (Figure 5B) EAF were observed in the present patient.\n\n【47】Though there is currently no consensus on the etiology of EAF. In 2011， Deshpande et al. \\[16\\] concluded that it belongs to the spectrum of lgG4-related diseases， which are character-ized by a “tumefactive\" or nodule-like lesion， large numbers of IgG4 positive plasma cells， and an elevated IgG4-positive to total IgG-positive cell ratio \\[2，8，16，17\\]. Criteria for the di-agnosis of lgG4-related diseases are summarized in Table 2， and all findings in the present patient were concordant with items 1-3 therein. Prominent lesions in bilateral upper eyelids， swelling， and raised serum lgG4 (179 mg/dL) were observed. Histopathological examinations revealed lymphocytes and plasma cell infiltration， increased IgG4-positive plasma cells， and a 45% proportion of IgG4-positive cells.\n\n【48】The differential diagnosis of EAF includes the consideration of Churg-Strauss syndrome， granulomatosis with polyangiitis，\n\n【49】Kimura's disease， Sjogren’s syndrome， and sarcoidosis \\[2，3\\]. Churg-Strauss syndrome and granulomatosis with polyangi-itis are reactive conditions characterized by eosinophilic infil-tration with systemic symptoms.\n\n【50】The lack of histologic features such as giant cells and ne-crosis aids in distinguishing EAF \\[2\\]. In this case， a negative blood test for ANCA helps exclude these diagnoses. Kimura's disease reveals histologically inflammatory cells and fibrosis； however， it shows a prominent germinal center， not fibrotic stroma， around vessels. Sjogren’s syndrome is an autoimmune disease that affects the body's moisture-producing glands. Primary symptoms are dry mouth and dry eyes. Sarcoidos is is a disease involving abnormal collections of inflammatory cells that form lumps known as granulomas. The disease usually be-gins in the lungs， skin， or lymph nodes and sometimes affects the eyes. However， the lack of systemic signs， negative auto-immune serology， and nonspecific MRI help exclude Sjogren’s syndrome and sarcoidosis. Furthermore， the well-developed angiocentric fibrosis in our case is highly characteristic of EAF.\n\n【51】No definitive treatment has been identified， but most cases are treated with surgical resection alone or combined with medication \\[1，18-21\\]. In 62% of surgeries， patients underwent complete resection， with a recurrence rate of 20%\\[10\\]. The re-currence rate is high and multiple excisions are frequently re-quired \\[1，2\\]. The present case was considered IgG4-related dis-ease， which was steroid-reactive， so we provided therapy with triamcinolone acetonide subconjunctival injection and 0.1%fluorometholone eye drop 4 times a day after surgery. The eye drops were gradually reduced， and she has been symptom-free for half a year after the resection.\n\n【52】A B\n\n【53】Figure 6. Immunohistochemical staining in the upper conjunctiva (high-power magnification). (A) Immunohistochemical staining for IgG4. A large number of IgG4-positive cells are evident (89-99 per high-power field). (B) Immunohistochemical staining for total IgG. A large number ofIgG-positive cells are evident (approximately 205 cells per high-power field). Of all IgG-positive cells， 45% were IgG4-positive cells.\n\n【54】Although some studies reported that systemic rituximab ad-ministration was effective in treating EAF \\[22，23\\]， we used only topically in this case， which had no sign of general symptoms.\n\n【55】Conclusions\n\n【56】Herein， we have described the first reported case of EAF in-volving bilateral upper eyelid conjunctivas. Surgical resec-tion was successful， and no recurrence has occurred within 6months after surgery.\n\n【57】References：\n\n【58】1\\.

Until recently， management of TD was restricted to low-ering the dose of the current medication， switching to another medication， or using off-label treatments with insufficient evidence of efficacy. Valbenazine， a vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT2) inhibitor，became the first drug to be approved by the FDA specifically for the treatment of TD.\n\n【15】Case Report：\n\n【16】Conclusions：\n\n【17】We describe the case of a 49-year-old African-American woman who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the age of 34 and treated with lithium carbonate (900 mg daily) and citalopram (10 mg daily). She also received low doses of second-generation antipsychotics for weeks at a time， but these were always discontinued due to severe sedation. Over a decade later， at the age of 45， she experienced rapid onset of severe TD symptoms. She enrolled in a phase III double-blind clinical trial and received valbenazine 80 mg， with encouraging results. Once-daily dosing of valbenazine (80 mg) was effective and safe over a long period， even in this atypical case\n\n【18】of severe and rapid-onset TD.\n\n【19】MeSH Keywords： Movement Disorders·Treatment Outcome ·Vesicular Monoamine Transport Proteins\n\n【20】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/906454\n\n【21】2288 01 1 ￥10\n\n【22】Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a disorder characterized by a wide range of involuntary choreoathetoid movements \\[1\\]. The clin-ical picture is often a mixture of facial grimacing， flicks of the tongue， and smacking of the lips. Additionally， there may be rapid jerking movements or slow writhing movement in the extremities. Although TD most commonly occurs in patients treated long-term with dopaminergic antagonist medications， TD-like movements were reported as de novo cases long before the development of the first-generation antipsychotic (FGA) agents. People with schizophrenia， bipolar disorder， and oth-er neuropsychiatric disorders are especially vulnerable to the development of TD due to their exposure to first- and second-generation antipsychotics， anticholinergics， toxins， and sub-stance abuse. Until recently， management of this condition was suboptimal and restricted to drug discontinuation (when clinically possible)， switching to less potent dopamine antag-onists， or off-label treatments with insufficient evidence of ef-ficacy， such as clonazepam and amantadine， or vitamin A， vi-tamin E， or ginkgo biloba \\[2\\].\n\n【23】Recently， the emergence of a new vesicular monoamine trans-porter-2 (VMAT2) inhibitor has generated enthusiasm as a treatment for TD. Valbenazine was the first VMAT2 inhibitor(NBI-98854) approved by the US Food and Drug Administration(FDA) for the treatment for TD \\[3，4\\]. It is a novel， highly se-lective VMAT2 inhibitor. Normally， VMATs facilitate the trans-port of dopamine (and other monoamines) into synaptic ves-icles for future release into the synaptic cleft (\"exocytosis\"). In contrast， VMAT2 inhibitors block the loading of dopamine into synaptic vesicles， thus reducing dopamine release and de pleting dopamine levels throughout the brain \\[5\\]. The approval of valbenazine has been followed by the very recent FDA ap proval (August 30，2017) of a second VMAT2 inhibitor， known as deutetrabenazine (SD-809)， for the treatment of TD \\[6，7\\].\n\n【24】We present the case of\"Ms. K\"， a 49-year-old African-American woman who took part in KINECT 3， the phase 3 pivotal trial of valbenazine \\[4\\]. At the age of 34， she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and then at the age of 45 symptoms of TD emerged. In 2013， prior to enrollment in KINECT 3， she consult-ed a movement disorder specialist who gave her an Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) \\[8\\] total score (sum of items1-7) of 28， and described her as \"the worst case of TD I have ever seen\". Following that evaluation (in 2013)， she was referred to our site for possible enrollment into the KINECT 3 study.\n\n【25】History\n\n【26】Ms. K was raised by her maternal grandmother and several aunts and remembers a stable， nurturing early childhood. At the age of 9， she met her biological mother for the first time and moved with her from the Midwest to the Northeast. From that point， her home life was marked by verbal and physical abuse and neglect. Despite a chaotic home life， the patient excelled academically， attending private elementary and sec-ondary schools， and entered college on a full scholarship in-tending to go into medicine.\n\n【27】Unfortunately， in her freshman year she began having episodes of hypomania， irritability， depressed moods， sleeplessness， and impulsive behavior， including a suicide attempt. She began to abuse alcohol and marijuana. In her sophomore year， she be-came pregnant， dropped out of school， and began working full-time at a bank， where she was rapidly promoted. Soon she “... had a good salary...was living the good life...spending tons of money on very expensive clothes， shoes， and a whole lot of jewelry\". In her early 30's， she began using cocaine， and， as her career flourished， so did her cocaine and crack consump-tion. During one of several admissions for treatment of drug abuse，a psychiatrist“... suggested that I needed to get treat-ed for bipolar disorder if l ever wanted to get well\". In re-sponse，“I bluntly informed that psychiatrist that I'm not cra-zy and that I just need to get my cocaine use under control. In no time， I had been hospitalized 10 times for episodes of mania or depression\". Her treatment included mood stabilil-zers， antidepressants， and an occasional low dose of second-generation antipsychotics. She gained a considerable amount of weight， and was noncompliant with her medications when discharged from the hospital. Her highly successful career soon came to an abrupt end and she found herself working odd jobs and needing public assistance to survive. As she cel-ebrated her 40th birthday， she began to realize that “my life was totally out of control\".\n\n【28】Psychiatric intervention\n\n【29】Now， with 3 children and few financial or personal resources， she joined Narcotics Anonymous， stopped using cocaine，and initiated psychiatric treatment. Her medications consisted of a mood stabilizer (lithium carbonate 900 mg daily) and an anti-depressant (citalopram 10 mg daily)， with occasional low dos-es of second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) added for sleep(usually risperidone or quetiapine， although she was also brief-ly on aripiprazole and ziprasidone). Her SGA treatments were intermittent， at times only 2-3 weeks. She was nevertreated with a first-generation antipsychotic (FGA). Even at the lowest doses， SGAs caused excessive drowsiness and were regularly\n\n【30】discontinued. Her bipolar symptoms were progressively brought under control. She regularly exercised， worked part-time in a community hospital， and enrolled part-time at a local college. She commented that this was a time when “1 felt the most normal and healthy that I can remember\".\n\n【31】Onset of movement disorder\n\n【32】In 2011， she began to notice minor involuntary movements in her fingers and hands， but attributed them to anxiety. Initially， the movements did not seem to be a cause for concern. Soon. lip puckering appeared and “...my lower jaw started jerking back and forth...people began to stare at me\". When a family member commented on the movements，“l decided to check it out with my family doctor， who immediately referred me to a movement disorder clinic at one of the local medical schools. That was when I was formally diagnosed with TD. I had no idea what those words would mean for my life\". At that time， the patient was again being treated with risperidone (4 mg daily) for sleep， and the consulting neurologist recommended she be switched to quetiapine (400 mg daily). The movements wors-ened， involving the entire body， and the quetiapine was dis-continued. Balance and gait disturbances became very obvious(with occasional falls in public) and she began biting the inside of her mouth. Symptoms of dystonia developed. The movements were now so obvious that her employer fired her \"for being drunk on the job\".On several occasions， a professor in one of her college classes publically “told me to please sit still or leave the room\"， and“people just stared at me wherever I went\".\n\n【33】It was at this point， in 2013， that Ms. K returned to the move-ment disorder specialist she had seen previously， and he de scribed her as“the worst case of TD I have ever seen\". He con-tacted our group， hoping the patient would be eligible for the valbenazine project. In October 2014， she signed an informed consent， and screening commenced.\n\n【34】Screening and enrollment into KINECT 3\n\n【35】The abrupt onset and severity of her symptoms were unusual； in less than 2 years she had gone from being symptom-free to the “worst case of TD I have ever seen\". More than a decade had passed between her initial exposure to antipsychotics and the onset of TD. This raised several questions. Was this neu-roleptic-induced TD， a spontaneous dyskinesia， or some oth-er neurologic condition? Moreover， during screening， the pa-tient began to search for her estranged biological father and learned that he had recently died in an institution with a diag-nosis of unspecified dementia and motor disturbance. Further complicating the picture was her history of intermittent co-caine and crack use for a dozen years or more. These drugs block the dopamine transporter and have been associated with a variety of movement disorders \\[8\\]. Therefore， as part\n\n【36】of screening， a brain MRI was ordered to rule-out structural lesions. Genetic testing was ordered to rule-out Huntington's disease. Another consultation was requested at the universi-ty-based movement disorders clinic to confirm their original TD diagnosis. The results from the brain MRl and Huntington’s disease test returned negative.\n\n【37】Her medica. history included hypertension， mitral valve pro-lapse， cutaneous lupus erythematosus， an episode of viral men-ingitis， and chronic constipation. She was being treated with lithium carbonate for her mood disorder， citalopram for de-pression，clonazepam and Ativan for movement disorder， and lisinopril for high blood pressure. The clonazepam and Ativan had little to no effect on the severity of her TD symptom. With inclusion and exclusion criteria satisfied， the patient was ran-domized to one of the 3 blinded-treatment arms.\n\n【38】Treatment response\n\n【39】The AlMS ratings used in this study were the mean of con-sensus scores from 2 blinded centralized raters. The average baseline AlMS rating for KINECT 3 study participants (n=227) was 10.0 (SD=4.0)， and the baseline AIMS for this case was14. Figure 1 displays Ms. K's change from baseline in AIMS ratings superimposed on the mean change from baseline in AlMS ratings of the intent-to-treat (ITT) population from the6-week KINECT 3 study. By week 6， her AIMS total score was reduced by 50% from baseline， which is considered by many to be a robust treatment response.\n\n【40】Upon completion of the 6-week study， Ms. K elected to contin-ue in the subsequent 42-week， double-blind extension study. She continued on 80 mg of valbenazine and her TD symptoms continued to improve， but did not completely resolve. The AIMS total score is an overall picture of symptom reduction， but does not provide any specific information regarding individual symp-toms. A review of her actual AlMS video record showed symp-tom reduction across all body regions. Importantly， her cho-reiform dyskinesia showed more improvement than did her dystonia， although both showed meaningful reduction. It ap-peared that stress and anxiety were at times associated with a worsening of her movement symptoms. As her TD symptoms diminished， Ms. K began to socialize and re-establish relation-ships with her estranged family and slowly began to return to more normal activities of daily living. Her cardiac condition and psychiatric status remained stable throughout the study.\n\n【41】Regarding adverse effects， the patient experienced marked sedation when taking 80 mg of valbenazine and often slept most of the afternoon and into the evening. This resulted in her occasionally missing her BID and TID doses of psychiat-ric medications. She did not want to reduce the valbenazine dose， and within 2-3 weeks the sedation subsided. She had\n\n【42】other adverse effects， including an episode of drooling， nasal congestion， a very brief episode of mania， and a foot fracture from falling when walking on ice. These were transient， mild-to-moderate in severity， and judged by the investigator as un-related， or unlikely to be related， to the study drug. The brief episode of mania took place when she was experiencing drug-related sedation and had been inconsistent in taking her mood stabilizer in the afternoon and evening for more than a week.\n\n【43】At the conclusion of the KINECT 3 extension phase， the patient underwent a mandatory 4-week “wash-out”\" to formally end the study (November 2015)， and then another 4 months be-cause the study drug was unavailable. Without the study drug， her TD symptoms returned to the previous baseline level of severity. This is an important observation for Ms. K， as well as the other study participants， in who TD symptoms returned to baseline levels with discontinuation of the study drug \\[3，4，6，7\\] This suggests that the underlying pathophysiology of TD may be irreversible and that long-term treatment is required. In March 2016， Ms. K resumed valbenazine treatment and now， with FDA approval (April 11， 2017)， she is able to receive val-benazine through a specialized pharmacy. As before， the drug was effective in treating her symptoms， and now， after 2 years of treatment， the clinical improvement appears to be very sta-ble， and Ms. K now often says “... I feel hopeful for the future\".(See Video 1 for short clips at baseline and week 6).\n\n【44】Video 1. Ms. K sitting， standing， and walking at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment with valbenazine. (Photo courtesy of Brian Troy.)\n\n【45】Discussion\n\n【46】Recent progress with selective VMAT2 inhibitors has opened up a new and encouraging avenue for the treatment of TD. It is a striking development that raises several interesting ques-tions. Will reducing the availability of dopamine throughout the brain have a therapeutic effect on any psychiatric symp-toms? Does long-term VMAT treatment repair the underlying\n\n【47】pathophysiology of TD? Is valbenazine effective in iatrogen-ic and non-iatrogenic causes of dyskinesia? Will early inter-vention with VMAT2 inhibitors prevent or delay the onset of TD? As with the introduction of any new medication， impor-tant questions arise， and only future studies will elucidate the full potential of the medication. Nonetheless， the findings that VMAT2 inhibitors are effective and safe over a long period of time， even in cases with severe symptoms， is very welcome news for psychiatric medicine.\n\n【48】Conclusions\n\n【49】This is a case report regarding the positive experience of one individual with severe TD who took valbenazine. Although the case is somewhat atypical and complex， it is also illustrative and encouraging. The personal narrative and video provided by Ms. K demonstrates the profound negative consequences TD can have on one's life， and the potential restorative impact of successful treatment.\n\n【50】References：\n\n【51】1\\.

During an inciting pathologic condition， it produces ECG patterns identical to those of con-genitally-acquired Brugada syndrome and subsequently returns to normal ECG patterns upon resolution of the medical condition. This case report describes a 26-year-old man presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) for suspected heroin overdose with a rare ECG consistent with BrP secondary to acute hyperkalemia.\n\n【21】Case Report： A 26-year-old man with a history of substance abuse and a seizure disorder presented to the ED for acute\n\n【22】encephalopathy secondary to a heroin overdose complicated by severe rhabdomyolysis and acute renal fail-ure. Laboratory investigations showed acute hyperkalemia (potassium of 7.2 mmol/L) in addition to an elevat-ed creatine kinase， severe transaminitis， and elevated creatinine. His ECG on admission revealed Brugada-like changes in leads V1-V2， with subsequent resolution upon bicarbonate administration and normalization of po-tassium. After initial stabilization， the patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). His rhabdomyol-ysis and acute kidney injury improved after copious rehydration. He was found to have community-acquired pneumonia， with a negative infectious disease workup， that improved with antibiotics. Upon resolution of his hypoxemic respiratory failure and improvement in mentation， he was discharged from the hospital.\n\n【23】Conclusions：\n\n【24】Our case report adds to the growing literature on BrP and highlights the importance of recognizing its charac-teristic ECG pattern as a unique presentation of a common electrolyte derangement.\n\n【25】MeSH Keywords： Brugada Syndrome · Drug Overdose· Hyperkalemia\n\n【26】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/923464\n\n【27】1 Department of Emergency Medicine， University of Kentucky College of Medicine， Lexington， KY， U.S.A.\n\n【28】2 Department of Emergency Medicine， University of Kentucky Hospital， Lexington， KY，U.S.A.\n\n【29】Interest in understanding the ionic channel dysfunction， arrhythmogenic potential， diagnosis， and treatment of Brugada phenocopies has grown markedly since the characterization of the condition in 2012 \\[1\\]. Identical to congenital Brugada syndrome， the ECG patterns characterizing BrP can be classi-fied into 2 patterns： the typical type 1 “coved\" and the type 2“saddleback\"\\[2，3\\].Over 100 cases have been reported in the medical literature， with causative medical conditions falling into 6 general categories： (1) metabolic abnormalities，(2) me-chanical compression，(3) ischemia and pulmonary embolism，(4) myocardial and pericardial disease， (5) ECG modulation， and(6) miscellaneous (electrical injury， Ebstein’s anomaly). Of these causes， metabolic derangements are the most common. One specific electrolyte disturbance， hyperkalemia， causes a mul-titude of ECG changes ranging from peaked T waves to sine waves. However， knowledge of its association with the Brugada pattern continues to grow. Here， we supplement the mounting number of cases detailing hyperkalemia as the driver of the reversible electrocardiographic phenomenon known as BrP.\n\n【30】A 26-year-old man with a history of cocaine and heroin abuse， as well as a seizure disorder， was brought to the ED by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) after being found lying down and unresponsive for approximately 10 hours due to an apparent overdose. EMS stated that the patient was found hypoxic， with an oxygen saturation of 68%， which improved to 95% on Venturi-mask. Both intranasal and I Narcan were given， without success. On arrival to the ED， pertinent subjec-tive information， including a personal history of syncope or family history of sudden cardiac death， was unable to be ob-tained because the patient was obtunded. Arousing on occa-sion and responding to noxious stimuli， there was a possibil-ity of previous seizure activity and being post-ictal. A bolus of Levetiracetam was given and a head CT was done， reveal-ing no acute changes. Vitals showed a temperature of 99.1°F(37.2C)， heart rate of 106 beats per minute， blood pressure116/78 mmHg， respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute， and an oxygen saturation of 95% on Venturi-mask. ECG showed a type 1 Brugada pattern in leads aVR， V1， and V2， which nor-malized after administering sodium bicarbonate (Figure 1).\n\n【31】Figure 1. Electrocardiogram (ECG) tracing in a 26-year-old male presenting with acute encephalopathy， acute hypoxic respiratory failure， and acute hyperkalemia， resulting in Brugada-like ECG changes. Top ECG tracing obtained while serum potassium measured 7.2 mmol/L， demonstrating the type 1 “coved\" Brugada pattern with concave， ST-segment elevation most prominent in leads V1 and V2 (arrow). Bottom ECG tracing demonstrating resolution of ST-segment changes after correction of serum potassium to 4.4 mmo/L.\n\n【32】Laboratory studies revealed a myriad of derangements， including： acute hyperkalemia (potassium of 7.2 mmol/L) and elevated creatine kinase (29，270 units/L on admit with maxi-mum of 74，750 units/L) thought to be secondary to drug over-dose-related crush myopathy， and transaminase elevation (AST4，052 units/L ALT 5，960 units/L) thought to be secondary to shock liver vs. rhabdomyolysis itself. Repeat potassium was4.4 mmol/L after administration of calcium gluconate， insu-lin， glucose， and sodium bicarbonate. Additionally， lactate levels were elevated at 3.5 mmol/L， venous blood gas was7.33/35 mmHg/61 mmHg/18 mmol/L consistent with anion gap acidosis， and creatinine above 3 mg/dL suggesting acute kidney injury， which improved following fluid supplementa-tion. Urine drug screening performed in the ED was positive for Levetiracetam， Fentanyl， and Norfentanyl.\n\n【33】After initial stabilization， the patient was admitted to the ICU still requiring Venturi-mask secondary to his mental status and acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Collateral history was ob-tained from the patient's family and was significant for chest discomfort， diaphoresis， and a dry scratchy throat for 1 week prior to presentation. Hyperkalemia protocols were initiated and normalized the potassium level to 3.9 mmol/L. His rhab-domyolysis and acute kidney injury resolved with vigorous hy-dration that restored his kidney function to baseline. He was noted to have community-acquired pneumonia with a nega-tive infectious workup (negative blood cultures， negative uri-nary Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella antigens，and negative respiratory viral panel) for which he finished a course of Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone， resulting in resolution of hypoxia. The patient's mentation improved， and he was dis-charged from the hospital.\n\n【34】Discussion\n\n【35】Hyperkalemia causes ECG alterations， including tall， peaked， and tented T waves， widened and flattened P waves， widening of the QRS complex， AV blocks， sine wave rhythms， and asys-tole. However， presentation with coved ST-segment elevation representing a Brugada pattern is uncommon. In our case， the etiology of hyperkalemia causing Brugada-like changes was likely multifactorial， indicating a combination of rhabdomyoly-sis， acidosis， and acute renal failure， resulting in increased po-tassium release from muscle breakdown，transcellular shifts， and impaired excretion. Rapid treatment with calcium gluco-nate， insulin， and sodium bicarbonate resulted in ECG nor-malization， likely reflecting an improvement in both hyper-kalemia and acidemia. Levetiracetam， which inhibits N-type calcium channels and delayed rectifier potassium currents， was administered， but this took place after the initial ECG show-ing Brugada-like changes， and thus was probably not an im-portant contributing factor. The transient nature of the ECG\n\n【36】alteration is a hallmark in differentiating Brugada syndrome from Brugada phenocopy \\[4\\].\n\n【37】The congenitally-acquired channelopathy known as Brugada syndrome (BrS) and the reversible conditions leading to Brugada phenocopy differ in many clinically relevant ways. BrS is an autosomal dominant disorder that predisposes patients to le thal arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death without identifiable structural abnormalities. The most common cause is inheriting one of the approximately 290 pathogenic variants that have been identified in the SCN5A gene， which encodes for a spe-cific cardiac sodium channel. Nevertheless， many other genes can cause the disorder， including genes coding for subunits of sodium channels or other ionic channels \\[5\\]. This locus and allelic heterogeneity account for the variable penetrance as-sociated with BrS. Two-thirds of patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis， while one-third are identified after non-specific symptomatology (e.g.， syncope and aborted sudden cardiac death). Once a patient is identified and risk-stratified accord-ing to risk of sudden cardiac death， a complex management begins. However， the only proven effective therapy is implan-tation of an implantable cardioverter device (ICD) to terminate lethal arrhythmias. Recently， ablation of the arrhythmic elec-trophysiological substrate (AES)， purported to be in the epicar-dium of the right ventricular anterior wall and outflow tract， has been suggested as a possible therapeutic option result-ing in correction of ECG abnormalities \\[5，6\\].\n\n【38】The causes and management strategies mentioned above for BrS differ significantly from those for BrP. The proposed patho-genesis of these reversible Brugada-like patterns is largely de-scribed by two theories. The repolarization theory describes ion current imbalances during phase 1 of the myocyte action po-tential in which partial repolarization occurs as the precluding abnormality. Specifically， an increased transient outward potas-sium current () or decreased inward currents， either through L-type calcium currents or peak sodium currents， create focal ionic imbalances that give rise to reentry arrhythmias \\[7-10\\]. Alternatively， the depolarization theory describes a focus in the right ventricular outflow tract that undergoes delayed depo-larization and establishes an electrical gradient for the rest of the right ventricular circuitry， creating a dysrhythmia \\[7-10\\]. More recent studies using simulations of the anterior ventricu-lar wall showed that potassium concentration， fibrosis， andL are all involved the development of the Brugada pattern and act synergistically to shape the characteristic pattern \\[11\\]. As presented in our case， high levels of extracellular potassium lead to an increase in the normal resting membrane potential and subsequent inactivation of the sodium channels and de-layed conduction. The subsequent creation of ionic imbalanc-es lends support to repolarization as the driver of ECG chang-es in our case. Nevertheless， much of the current speculation is based on studies from BrS due to the relative rarity of BrP\n\n【39】and lack of animal models. Furthering the distinction between BrS and BrP， there are no data showing an increase in the risk of SCD in those with BrP； therefore， treatment should focus on amelioration of the underlying condition rather than car-dioverter-defibrillator implantation.\n\n【40】References：\n\n【41】1\\.

These may be followed by second- and third-line options， including thrombopoietin re-ceptor agonists and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor fostamatinib. These treatments have different mechanisms and divergent adverse event profiles. We show that fostamatinib-associated adverse events can be mitigat-ed with fostamatinib dose reduction and the introduction of avatrombopag， and that response can be main-tained with avatrombopag monotherapy.\n\n【26】Case Report：\n\n【27】A 61-year-old woman with a history of chronic refractory immune thrombocytopenia since 2006 had previous-ly received steroids， rituximab， splenectomy and eltrombopag without achieving platelet count stability. The patient reported flu-like symptoms in February 2020， with platelet counts ranging from 25x10/L to 50x10L and isolated occurrences <10x10°/L. Platelet counts did not respond to eltrombopag 75 mg/day 2 courses of rituximab， or multiple courses of prednisone. Within 2 weeks of starting fostamatinib 150 mg twice daily， she reached a platelet count of 523×10/L She experienced new-onset diarrhea associated with fostamatinib， so the dose was reduced to 75 mg twice daily， and avatrombopag 20 mg/day was added to augment platelet recov-ery Platelet levels remained in the supratherapeutic range. She was transitioned to avatrombopag 40 mg/day monotherapy and then 20 mg/day owing to continued supratherapeutic platelet counts.\n\n【28】Conclusions： Avatrombopag can be used in combination with fostamatinib to augment platelet response and reduce the severity of adverse events associated with fostamatinib， while maintaining adequate therapeutic response in chronic immune thrombocytopenia. Avatrombopag 40 mg/day monotherapy was quite effective in achieving and maintaining high platelet counts.\n\n【29】Keywords： Fostamatinib· Platelet Count· Purpura， Thrombocytopenic， Idiopathic · Receptors， Thrombopoietin\n\n【30】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/933788\n\n【31】品目日22089 32\n\n【32】Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disor-der in which patients experience thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100x10°/L) \\[1\\]. Treatment is aimed at achieving a safe platelet count (>20-30×10/L) to prevent episodes of severe bleeding \\[2\\]. Guideline-recommended first-line therapy for ITP is corticosteroids，intravenous immunoglobin， anti-D， or a combination of 2 to 3 of these drugs \\[2\\]. Patients who are re-lapsed or refractory to corticosteroids have several second-line or later treatment options. Those supported by robust clini-cal evidence include thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs)， rituximab， fostamatinib， and splenectomy \\[2，3\\]. These treatments act via a variety of mechanisms. Generally， TPO-RAs act by stimulating platelet cell production， and rituximab， fostamatinib， and splenectomy act by reducing immune cell destruction of platelet cells. More specifically， TPO-RAs bind to the thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor and stimulate mega-karyocyte progenitor proliferation and increased platelet pro-duction \\[4-6\\].TPO-RAs that are indicated for use in ITP in the United States and Europe include avatrombopag and eltrom-bopag， which are orally formulated， and romiplostim， which is injectable \\[7-12\\]. Although not approved for the treatment of ITP， rituximab is sometimes used as an off-label treatment in these patients. The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody， ritux-imab， depresses B-cell counts and may also modify T-cell ac-tivity \\[13-15\\]. For rituximab responders， treatment results in a significant rise in platelet counts \\[13\\]. However， a randomized， placebo-controlled phase 3 trial demonstrated that overall and complete response rates were similar in adult patients with ITP who were treated with rituximab or placebo \\[16\\]. Fostamatinib acts through yet another mechanism by inhibiting spleen ty-rosine kinase (Syk) and thus blocking Syk signaling-mediated platelet destruction in patients with ITP， resulting in increased platelet counts in responders \\[17\\].Splenectomy is also an op-tion； because the spleen is the primary site of platelet clear-ance and autoantibody production， spleen removal results in durable platelet response \\[18\\]. However， recent treatment guidelines recommend that splenectomy be reserved for pa-tients who have failed medical therapies \\[2\\].\n\n【33】Adverse events play a role in treatment decisions； agents with different mechanisms have different safety profiles. With TPO-RAs， there is a potential for increased risk of thrombosis (ap-proximately 6-7%) \\[7，9，11，19\\]. The B-cell-depleting effects of rituximab can result in increased risk of hypogammaglobu-linemia and infectious complications \\[20\\]. Tyrosine kinase in-hibitor-associated adverse events can occur with the Syk in-hibitor fostamatinib and include diarrhea and hypertension in about one-third oftreated patients \\[17\\]. Nausea， dizziness， and liver enzyme increase are also relatively common (> 10%of treated patients)\\[17\\].\n\n【34】Combination therapy in patients with ITP provides a potential opportunity to improve efficacy by targeting different mecha-nisms of disease pathology and to reduce adverse events. For example， some small studies have reported some benefits to TPO-RA combined with steroids as first-line \\[21\\] and later-line\\[22，23\\] treatment for patients with ITP. Additionally， studies have shown that switching to another TPO-RA if the first TPO-RA fails results in a high number of patients who are able to maintain or achieve response with the new treatment \\[24\\]. Fostamatinib and avatrombopag are the 2 most recently approved agents for the treatment of ITP (April 2018 and June 2019， respectively) \\[25，26\\].\n\n【35】This case study reviews the treatment of a 61-year-old wom-an who had a history of chronic refractory ITP and who had previously received steroids， rituximab， splenectomy， and el-trombopag， all of which failed to result in a stable platelet count. Although treatment with fostamatinib resulted in sta-ble platelet counts， a combination of low-dose fostamatinib and avatrombopag was initiated to alleviate treatment-asso-ciated diarrhea while maintaining a stable platelet count. The outcome of this combination therapy is described here.\n\n【36】Case Report\n\n【37】This was a 61-year-old woman who was diagnosed with ITP in 2006. Her past medical history included Meniere disease and an undefined connective tissue disorder； past surgeries included tonsillectomy， appendectomy， lysis of adhesions，car-pal tunnel release， and splenectomy with subsequent drainage of abscess. The patient did not smoke cigarettes and drank about 1 alcoholic beverage per week.\n\n【38】The patient presented on February 18， 2020， with a platelet count of 18x10/L， which was a reduction compared with her previous visit (166×10/L， January 14，2020). She had been re-ceiving tapering doses of oral eltrombopag； at the time of the visit， her dose was 25 mg/day which was increased to 50 mg/day because of the low platelet count. She responded to treatment with an increased platelet count of 117x10°/L (March 3， 2020)； however， on March 17， 2020， it had decreased to 14x10/L de-spite the higher dose of eltrombopag. She was switched from eltrombopag to oral fostamatinib 100 mg twice daily and had a good initial response， but， after about 2 weeks， her platelet counts dropped significantly (10x10/L). The dose of fostama-tinib was increased to 150 mg twice daily， but the patient con-tinued to experience bruising and she started herselfon pred-nisone. Her platelet count was 25x10°/L on April 14， 2020， and she was switched from fostamatinib to eltrombopag (75mg/day). The patient was seen again on May 4， 2020， report-ing she had presented to the Emergency Department over the weekend (May 2， 2020) with a platelet count of 1x10°/L The patient was started on intravenous rituximab (375 mg/m²) the\n\n【39】following day， and on May 8， 2020， a spiral computed tomog raphy scan revealed no accessory or regenerative splenic tis-sue. Rituximab treatment resulted in improved platelet counts； however， on June 9， 2020， her platelet count dropped to 7x10/L after being 107×10°/L the week prior. At this visit， the patient restarted eltrombopag at 50 mg/day； this was titrated up to75 mg/day 1 week later owing to an inadequate platelet re-sponse. On July 7， 2020， the patient was being treated with el-trombopag at 75 mg/day and her platelet count was stable at44×10°/L. The patient was seen at the University of Virginia for a second opinion on September 1， 2020， and reported that she had been having very little response on eltrombopag 75 mg/day and that she had switched to fostamatinib 2 weeks prior (150mg orally twice daily)； her platelet count was 523x10/L， and it was recommended that she continue on fostamatinib.\n\n【40】Her platelet count trended down through the end of September2020， at which point she was started on eltrombopag 75 mg/day in addition to the fostamatinib 150 mg twice daily， and on October 1，2020， her platelet count had increased to 342x10°/L The eltrombopag was then changed to avatrombopag 20 mg/day owing to liver function test abnormalities， and the avatrom-bopag was subsequently discontinued because of persistently high platelet counts. While on fostamatinib alone (150 mg twice daily)， the patient's platelet counts began to slowly drift down-ward， and her count was 73x10°/L on December 29， 2020. At this time， the patient reported having some difficulty with diarrhea， a known toxicity of fostamatinib. On January 2， 2021， she restart-ed avatrombopag 20 mg every other day and decreased fosta-matinib to 100 mg twice daily； platelets increased to 147x10°/L on January 4， 2021. Due to continued difficulty with diarrhea， her dose of fostamatinib was reduced to 75 mg twice daily to help reduce the associated diarrhea， and avatrombopag was increased from 20 mg every other day to 20 mg/day to main tain platelet counts. On February 2， 2021， the patient was do-ing well with the combination； her diarrhea had improved and her platelet count was 395x10/L. The patient was seen again on March 2， 2021， and reported that she was having increas-ing difficulty with diarrhea related to fostamatinib. Her platelet count was quite high at 617x10°/L Given the supratherapeu-tic platelet count and the difficulty with fostamatinib-associat-ed diarrhea， fostamatinib treatment was discontinued， and the patient was switched to avatrombopag monotherapy with the dose increased to 40 mg/day. The platelet count was 534x10/L on March 30， 2021， so the avatrombopag dose was decreased to 20 mg/day. The platelet counts and dosing for fostamatinib and avatrombopag over time are shown in Figure 1.\n\n【41】Discussion\n\n【42】This case study demonstrates that TPO-RAs can be used in combination with other classes of drugs to alleviate adverse\n\n【43】events by allowing for a dose reduction while still maintain-ing a safe platelet count. TPO-RAs have a unique mechanism of action relative to other agents used to treat ITP and in the-ory may provide synergistic effects in combination with other therapies， particularly in patients who are resistant or refracto ry to treatment. There are few reports of TPO-RA combination therapy for ITP， and these generally report on combinations with steroids. A small study reported that first-line eltrom-bopag plus high-dose dexamethasone improved response rate in newly diagnosed ITP (vs historical data of dexameth-asone monotherapy) \\[21\\]. A small study of eltrombopag and high-dose dexamethasone in patients with chronic ITP report-ed complete response (platelet count 2100×10/L) in 10 of 11patients \\[22\\]. It has also been reported that a TPO-RA com-bined with a low steroid dose (2.5-5 mg prednisolone) can benefit patients who were not responding to treatment \\[23\\]. A small retrospective study of combination therapy with TPO-RA (either eltrombopag or romiplostim)， immunosuppressants， and intravenous immunoglobin in pediatric or adult patients with ITP reported that 13 of 18 were considered responders with this combination treatment \\[27\\]. The present case study is the first report of combination treatment with fostamatinib and a TPO-RA， as fostamatinib is a relatively new agent \\[25\\].\n\n【44】It should be noted that while TPO-RAs are mechanistically sim-ilar， they have different pharmacokinetic， safety， and effica-cy profiles； therefore， switching between them because of in-convenience， lack of efficacy， or unacceptable adverse events is a reasonable treatment approach \\[24，28\\]. For example， el-trombopag chelates polyvalent cations and should be taken either without a meal or at least 2 h before or 4 h after med-ications or products that contain polyvalent cations (eg，calci-um-rich food， antacids， and mineral supplements) \\[9，29\\]. This is not the case for avatrombopag， as it does not have the po-tential to chelate polyvalent cations \\[7，29\\].Another difference is that， in patients who are treated with eltrombopag， there is a need to monitor liver function， and dose adjustments can be necessary in certain populations (eg， Asian patients and pa-tients with liver impairment) \\[9，30\\]. In contrast， clinical trials of avatrombopag have reported only a few incidences， most of which were transient， of increased liver function tests with treatment \\[30，31\\]. Regarding efficacy， a recent review of retro-spective clinical data for patients who had switched from one TPO-RA to another reported that 78% of patients achieved or maintained a response after switching \\[24\\]. In patients who switched due to lack of efficacy， 65% had improved platelet counts after switching \\[24\\]. Prior to fostamatinib treatment， the patient in the present case study had been treated with eltrombopag on multiple occasions. Although she would ini-tially respond， she developed liver function abnormalities re-quiring a change of therapy. Despite this， she had an excellent response to a different TPO-RA， avatrombopag.\n\n【45】Although the diarrhea experienced by the patient was assumed to be caused by fostamatinib， as diarrhea is a known toxici-ty of the drug \\[32\\]， it was not possible to rule out other po tential causes for her diarrhea. We note that the patient had been treated with fostamatinib previously and did not expe rience diarrhea， and the onset of diarrhea was approximate-ly 4.5 months after the initiation of fostamatinib. However， the diarrhea did improve after fostamatinib dose reduction and was completely resolved after discontinuing fostamatinib.\n\n【46】Conclusions\n\n【47】In this first report of combined fostamatinib and avatrombopag for the treatment of a patient with ITP， it was found that the addition of avatrombopag to fostamatinib could allow for a re-duction in fostamatinib dose to mitigate adverse events that the patient was experiencing， while augmenting platelet re-sponse. The potential benefits of this combination may be due to the different mechanism of action of each drug. The patient ultimately was taken off fostamatinib and it was demonstrated that avatrombopag 40 mg/day monotherapy was quite effec-tive in achieving and maintaining high platelet values. The evi-dence presented in this case study provides support for further\n\n【48】References：\n\n【49】1\\. Rodeghiero F， Stasi R， Gernsheimer T， et al.

Prior to the introduction of widely available antibiotics， apical petrosi-tis has been a frequent complication of otitis media \\[1-4\\]. Gradenico syndrome， first reported in 1907， is also known as Gradenigo-Lannois syndrome (1904)， named after Maurice Lannois， and Giuseppe Conte Gradenigo \\[1\\].\n\n【26】Since the increased use of antibiotics for the management of otitis media， the prevalence of both acute and chronic forms of the disease has decreased. The syndrome is charac-terized by an ipsilateral paralysis of the sixth cranial nerve， impairment of the trigeminal nerve， including retro-orbital pain (the area supplied by the ophthalmic branch)， and mid-dle ear infection. The cranial nerve dysfunction is caused by an osteitis and local leptomeningitis near the apex of the os petrosum. In this region the trigeminal nerve ganglion and the abducens nerve lie closely together， separated from the petrous apex (PA) only by the dura mater \\[2，5-7\\]. The pe-trous apex bears a mucosally-lined pneumatized cell system， which communicates with the middle ear. These air cells are a route for the spread of infection， and may be the cause of petrositis， petrous apicitis， cavernous thrombophlebitis and hypertrophic parechymeningitis with communicating hydro-cephalus \\[6，8\\]. Treatment depends on the form of acute or chronic course and the extension of the disease.Occasionally， a neurosurgical consultation should be obtained.\n\n【27】The case of a young adolescent who developed Gradenigo syndrome as a complication of otitis media is described， fol-lowed by discussion of the relevant conservative manage-ment for complete recovery.\n\n【28】CASE REPORT\n\n【29】A 14-year old girl， with no significant past otological his-tory or other neurological problems， was admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) with 3-weeks right side otal-gia， headache， double vision， vomiting， and refractory to oral antibiotic therapy. On physical examination， cen-tral perforation was noted in the tympanic membrane of the right ear. Ipsilateral sixth nerve palsy was also present. There were no vertigo or meningeal signs or decrease in facial sensation. The remainder of the cranial nerve exam-ination was normal.\n\n【30】At admission the blood pressure was 135/76mm Hg， 70 puls-es per minute， and the temperature was 37.3°C. The patient was alert and well oriented. There was no conjunctival in-jection. The funduscopic examination was normal. The to-tal leukocyte count was 12，000/mm’ with 71% neutrophils，1% band forms， 14%lymphocytes， 6% eosinophils， and 4%monocytes. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 50mm at the end of first hour， and a C-reactive protein was 6.2 mg/1.\n\n【31】The patient was treated with a high dose of wide-spectrum intravenous antibiotics IV for 4 weeks. The dosage of amoxi-cillin given was doubled because of the increased incidence of Streptococcus pneumonia. Group A b-hemolytic strep-tococci， and S. aureus are the causative organisms in this\n\n【32】age range (>14 of years)， with intermediary resistance. She was given 90mg/kg per day in 3 administrations as recom-mended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In order to improve Eustachian tube function， topical va-soconstrictors (phenylephrine 0.25% 3 drops q3 h) were instilled into each nasal cavity for l week while the patient was supine with the neck extended. In order to prevent life-threatening complications such as thrombosis of the sinous， the patient was given inhibitor of platelets aggregation， with acetyl salicylic acid 50 mg per day and low dose intra-venous， methylprednisolone， 250mg twice per day. After 5days of antibiotics IV， a complete recovery of facial pain was obtained， and 10 days after the initiation of treatment the neurological examination showed a partial recovery of the sixth nerve palsy. For this reason， we decided to proceed to tympanostomy tube placement on the right ear in order to decompress it and improve the nerve palsy.\n\n【33】Because of tympanic membrane bulging and severe and persistent otalgia， for the first 2 weeks at the department the patient underwent a right myringotomy with ventila-tion tube insertion， which showed some fluid in the middle ear. There was also mucous in the aspiration. The bacteri-ological study revealed altered white bleod cells. No bacte-ria were identified. This might have been due to prior ad-ministration of antibacterial agents.\n\n【34】Her audiogram demonstrated normal hearing in both ears on pure tone averages. Her discrimination score was 86%in the right ear and 92% in the left ear. Tympanogram in the right ear was improved after tube removal l month lat-er. Post-treatment discrimination score was 90%.\n\n【35】The CT showed sclerosis of the left right antrum and pe-trous bone， loss of pneumatisation of the mastoid air cells and destruction of the petrous apex， with an enhancing mass around the petrous apex and the left parasellar re-gion (Figure 1). MRI confirmed the presence of extensive changes with abnormal enhancement located at the right PA extending into Meckel's cave and along the dura of the middle cranial fossa floor. The ventricular system was slight-ly enlarged. Inflammatory debris was detected in the right mastoid (Figure 2).\n\n【36】Her pyrexia and otalgia returned to normal 3 weeks after initial commencement of the intravenous antibiotic therapy and 2 weeks after myringotomy. Her inflammatory markers return to normal. The follow-up MRI 1 year later showed full recovery in right petrous apex， middle ear structures and mastoid air cells.\n\n【37】DISCUSSION\n\n【38】Petrous apicitis， also known as petrositis， is divided into acute and chronic forms. In acute otitis media， the most frequently isolated organisms are Streptococci， Staphylococeus\n\n【39】species， Haemophilus influenza， Pseudomonas species， Moraxella\n\n【40】catarrhal and various anerobes. Mycobacterium tuberculosis has\n\n【41】also been previously implicated. In chronic suppurative disease， frequent findings tend to be anerobes and Gram-negative organisms； Haemophilus influenza type B is a major etiological factor in cases of otitis media-associated menin-gitis. Suppurative otitis media associated with mastoiditis is usually associated with Bacteroides \\[3，6\\].\n\n【42】Figure 1. CT scan (bone window) shows sclerosis of the right mastoid antrum and petrous bone， obliteration of the definition of the middle and inner ear structures.\n\n【43】Most cases of petrous apicitis are considered to accur in pa-tients with well-developed air cell systems extending into the apex. However， cases of petrous apicitis have been de-scribed in non-pneumatized temporal bones. These cases may represent a direct spread of infection from an acute process in the middle ear， and thus represent a true osteo-myelitis， rather than infection of a cell system \\[9\\].\n\n【44】Due to the number of vital structures that pass near the PA， infection in this area can either result in symptomatology consistent with Gradenigo syndrome or may run under-detected for long periods of time due to vague symptoms. Symptoms include vertigo， facial paralysis， and hearing loss due to involvement of the otic capsule， as well as sensory dis-turbances or facial pain result from involvement of cranial nerve V due to compression and/or irritation of the gasse-rian ganglion. Dysfunction of the III and IV nerve has oc-casionally been reported due to anterior involvement and also dysfunction of IX through XII nerve due to posteri-or involvement.\n\n【45】As the technology of diagnostic radiology improves， more petrous apex lesions are being identified. Current imag-ing not only offers accurate localization of the lesion， but also in the majority of cases is also able to give important diagnostic information about the nature of the abnormali-ty \\[1，3，5，9\\]. Computed tomography (CT) is considered the imaging examination of choice to evaluate petrous apici-tis， due to its sensitivity and low false positive rate. Findings on CT include opacification or coalescence of the air cells of the petrous apex. Acute petrous apicitis that accurs into well developed air cells can generally appear as an expans-ile lesion within the apex， and enhance with contrast if an abscess is present. Chronic apicitis results in a destructive1es bone appearance that resembles osteomyelitis of the scull base \\[4\\]. CT scans demonstrate fluid-filled mastoid air cells and sclerosis of the bones， and the degree of periosteal\n\n【46】Figure 2. Coronal MRImage confirms the presence of extensive soft tissue along the middle and inner ear.\n\n【47】reaction and status of the middle ear structures can be as-sessed based on CT scan findings \\[4，8\\].\n\n【48】MRI scans are best for soft tissue lesion assessment \\[81.Acute petrous apicitis with abscess formation can be appreciated as a low intensity lesion on Tl-weighted images that may en-hance post-contrast. Chronic apicitis appears as an irregular heterogeneous appearance that is best demonstrated on T2images. MRI is also utilized to establish the extent of meninge-al and cerebral involvement， and helps differentiate between pathologies that may be encountered at the petrous apex.\n\n【49】MRI with angiography is the gold standard in the diagnosis of dura sinus thrombosis， providing excellent visualization both of large deep and superficial cerebral veins.\n\n【50】Treatment of Gradenigo syndrome with intratemporal com-plications involves intravenous antibiotics and myringotomy in those cases with an intact tympanic membrane. The de-cision whether to insert a ventilation tube depends on the findings during myringotomy (e.g.， pus in the middle ear).\n\n【51】McHugh et al. (1994) reported a case of Gradenigo syn-drome in which CT scan showed a small mass in the left IAC and MRI showed evidence of petrositis. These lesions markedly improved without aggressive treatment.The report also underlined the utility of gadolinium-enhanced MRI in identifying soft tissue inflammation and intraosseus disease in the absence of bone destruction \\[3，6，9\\].\n\n【52】Debridement (myringotomy) is a less aggressive surgical in-tervention， reserved for those patients unresponsive to in-travenous antibiotics or those with resistant organisms but with bulging tympanic membrane.\n\n【53】Surgery (wide-mastoidectomy) is indicated in 2 settings\\[3，4\\]： firstly， in cases with signs and symptoms of mastoid-itis， abscess formation within the petrous apex as well as in the epidural space or brain parenchyma， and second-ly， if there is no improvement despite adequate antibiotic therapy or antibiotics in combination with myringotomy. Mastoidectomy is performed as far as possible in the direc-tion of the petrous apex cells to drain the petrous abscess through the surgically opened cells and to stop the trap-ping phenomenon \\[2-4\\].\n\n【54】Once sufficient treatment has been established， decisions regarding the follow-up procedure and when to end anti-biotic treatment are crucial.\n\n【55】In the recent literature，intravenous an tibiotics are recom-mended for at least 2-3 weeks. Patients with an associated osteomyelitis may require up to 6 weeks of medical treat-ment.\\[3，5，7，10\\].\n\n【56】In patients who have been treated surgically， a follow-up CT or MRI is recommeded in order to establish eradica-tion of the infection， since abnormalities on MRI can per-sist for prolonged periods even though the patient presents as fully recovered. Normalization of finding indicates good healing. Negative values are the only reliable indication for stopping medical treatment.\n\n【57】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【58】Gradenigo syndrome may complicate acute otitis media， and should be suspected in case of unilateral headache and ab-ducens nerve palsy. The symptoms and signs can be subtle，\n\n【59】so the clinician must always have a high index of suspicion in order not to miss a critical diagnosis. Conservative man-agement， including myringotomy and prolonged antibiot-ic treatment without major surgery， may be considered as a treatment of choice. Surgical intervention should be per-formed if there is a life-threatening complication or a pus sample is obtained by mastoid drainage.\n\n【60】REFERENCES：\n\n【61】1\\.

Furthermore， basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is higher than any other cancer， with a strong inverse association with lat-itude and，consequently， the highest incidence in northern Aus-tralia \\[2\\]. For example， various local population-based surveys have shown similar annual rates per 100，000 between Townsville in northern Queensland and Nambour in south-eastern Queens-land，but muchhigher than Maryborough， Victoria \\[2\\]. Over50%of BCCS occur on the head or neck with a particular propensity for the eyelid， lip and nasolabial fold， followed by ears， nose， and cheek \\[2\\].\n\n【6】In cases of nasal lesions， soft triangle defects are considered one of the most difficult sub-unit to reconstruct due to the del-icate balance between functional and aesthetic outcomes and psychological and physical impacts should this reconstruction fail \\[3\\].

However， multiple of these require experience， resources， and support， which are out of reach to regional clinicians， thus resulting in a significant travel burden for many patients to atccess care.\n\n【11】Case report\n\n【12】A 66-year-old Caucasian male was referred to the surgical out-patient clinic of a peripheral hospital as a Category 1 patient for a biopsy-proven basal cell carcinoma on his nose. This lesion had been present for 6 months. However， it had been rapidly enlarging over two months. He had no previous skin lesions or excisions history and never had a formal skin check. Past med-ical history was significant for asymptomatic coronary artery disease (angiogram 2009 showing 40% stenosis of the Left An-terior Descending artery) without antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy， hypertension， low back pain， bilateral lower limb ve-nous insufficiency， and gout. He lived in the community with his wife， was independent of all activities of daily living， and was a distant ex-smoker.\n\n【13】On examination， his nose grossly deviated to the right fol-lowing multiple traumatic fractures in his youth. A raised， the pearly lesion was present on the left nasal ala and was approach-ing the rim of the nare. Histopathology from a punch biopsy performed in the community was consistent with an ulcerated BCC with a nodular pattern.\n\n【14】This anatomical location and the patient’s underlying cardio-vascular history represented a difficult reconstructive situation. As such， options of grafting and / or transposition flap were discussed. It was decided that a composite graft was likely the best option. However， the high risk of failure with a potential defect or notching and scarring was discussed at length.\n\n【15】The patient underwent surgery under General Anaesthetic with pre-operative intravenous antibiotics and local anaesthetic. The lesion was excised with 3mm margins radially and was taken as partial thickness superiorly and full thickness inferiorly(Figure 1a). The specimen was oriented， and the total resultant defect was 10mm in diameter (Figure 1b). A composite graft was harvested from the root of the helix of the right ear (Figure1c). It was inset into the defect with 5-0 vicryl rapide and 6-0novafil interrupted (Figure 1d). The donor site was closed by raising a posteriorly based transposition flap from the right pre-auricular region and then inset with 5-0 monocryl to the dermal layer， 5-0 vicryl rapide to the triangular fossa， and finally 6-0novafil in a running stitch to the superior and inferior aspects of the helical root (Figure 1e). Soft white paraffin was applied to all incisions after the case. The patient was discharged home the same day with a plan for regular application of soft white paraffin and a registrar review in 1 week for wound review and removal of sutures， followed by a consultant review 4 weeks post-operatively.\n\n【16】A routine Day 1 post-operative phone call was performed by nursing staff the following day， at which point the patient expressed concerns that his graft was dark and was accordingly advised to present to the hospital’s Emergency Department for review. At the time of surgical review， the graft was mildly dusky but appropriate for Day 1 post-operative. In addition， there was no evidence of venous congestion or collection beneath the graft. As such， he was discharged home with the follow-up plan unchanged.\n\n【17】The patient was seen in the clinic for a Day 7 review. At that time， the graft (Figure 2a) and donor site flap (Figure 2b) were healing well， with capillary refill responses of less than3 secondh. Removal of sutures was performed without issue. He was provided with a weaning plan for paraffin application. Histopathology results were reviewed， showing an infiltrating sclerosing basal cell carcinoma， invading the deep reticular der-mis and superficial skeletal muscle， but with no evidence of perineural invasion. The excision margins were clear.\n\n【18】Upon review at the 4-week post-operative mark， both wounds were fully healed with good colour match， nil shrink-age， and no other issues (Figure 3a & b). He was advised to commence massage to assist with scar softening and to optimise aesthetics if desired. He was discharged from the clinic at this time.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】The technique of composite grafting has existed for over 100years， although it is often under-utilised as a reconstructive option due to a lack of consensus over safe graft sizes， as well as a lack of familiarity with its use as the potential nasal defects that may require them are relatively uncommon \\[6\\]， hence the\n\n【21】Figg.. 1 Intraoperative p10-\n\n【22】tographs.(a) pre-operative photograph of biopsy-proven BCC.(b) defect post excision of the lesion， showing both partial and full thickness defect.

(b) progress of donor at POD7.\n\n【24】Fig. 3 (a) graft 4 weeks post. (b) donor 4 weeks post.\n\n【25】Successful reconstruction using this technique requires a com-bination of highly particular patient selection， critical defect analysis， and meticulous reconstructive planning \\[4\\]. Patient factors include overall comorbidities， prior skin cancer and nasal surgery， head and neck irradiation which can compromise vas-cularity， and tobacco use with its increased risk of flap and graft failure \\[4\\]. However， as a distant ex-smoker with minimal other comorbidities， particularly considering his age， this patient was considered a suitable candidate for this reconstruction method.\n\n【26】Chondro-cutaneous composite grafts are suitable for both inner and outer reconstruction of the nose and in relatively large-sized defects without donor site morbidity， along with the benefits of being able to be performed over a single stage with a shorter surgical time than other reconstructive options for nasal defects \\[71. However， while the technical implemen-tation of composite grafts is simple， one must be meticulous to ensure survival and aesthetics \\[3\\]. In addition， multiple studies have illustrated a potential risk of shrinkage of composite grafts and， as such， recommend limiting their use to small defects less than 10mm in diameter， which subsequently also reduces the risk of necrosis as revascularisation occurs predominantly at the periphery of the defect. However， other studies have shown success with grafts up to 25mm \\[3，6\\]. It is this risk of necrosis and failure that many clinicians find off-putting， hence avoiding it as a reconstructive option.\n\n【27】The alar rim is a free margin representing an immobile land-mark， in which normal wound healing and contracture tend to pull the alar rim upwards， potentially causing a notch de-formity， requiring careful reconstructive planning \\[4\\]. Defects of the ala are also unique in that they are the most common subunit to involve the internal lining and therefore require more complex three-dimensional repair. In addition， their vulnera-bility to collapse usually requires cartilage grafting \\[5\\]. Donor site selection requires consideration of the defect's size， symme-try， colour matching with surrounding tissue， skin texture， the overall condition of surrounding tissue， and the same regard for the donor site \\[7\\]. The donor for nasal composite grafts is often auricular， sourced from either the helical root for convex defects (e.g. cutaneous ala) or conchal bowl for concave surfaces requiring epithelium， for example， internal lining defects \\[5\\]. In the case presented， the defect was a full thickness in parts， involving both convex and concave surfaces. However， concave predominated， leading to a helical root donor selection.\n\n【28】To the author's knowledge， composite grafting for nasal de fects in a peripheral centre has not been described， with the current body of research originating from sub-specialist units within metropolitan tertiary and quaternary centres. Document-ing the successful use of a chondro-cutaneous graft in this set-ting opens the possibility of its potential use in peripheral and regional centres. Furthermore， the requirement for review on Post Operative Day (POD) 1 would have logistically been signifi-cantly more difficult and at a higher burden to the patient should the procedure have been performed at a metropolitan unit and the patient already returned to their peripheral home. This is another benefit of utilising composite grafting in peripheral and rural centres.\n\n【29】Conclusion\n\n【30】In this case， a composite graft was successfully used at a periph-eral centre to reconstruct a defect at the upper limit of what is usually considered viable. Although careful patient selection\n\n【31】and surgical planning are required， composite grafting for re-construction is of minimal technical difficulty and， in this case， also requires minimal post-operative follow-up and care at a site that is highly accessible to the patient， thus making it an attrac-tive and suitable reconstructive option for use in peripheral and regional centres， which may， in turn， reduce the burden of care for these patients.\n\n【32】Conflict of interest\n\n【33】There are no conflicts of interest to declare by any of the authors of this study.\n\n【34】References\n\n【35】1\\.

Initially，she underwent lumbar stabilization surgery， followed by high-dose palliative radiotherapy to the lumbar spine. Subsequently a total thyroidectomy was performed， followed by an ablative dose of radioiodine and supraphysiological doses of levothyroxine to achieve TSH suppression to less than 0.1 mU/L. The treatment dose of radioiodine was administered 4 times at 6-month intervals. The treat-ment was well tolerated， with a dramatic thyroglobulin response， and the disease remained radioiodine-sen-sitive. Prior to a fifth planned dose of radioiodine， our patient presented with cauda equina syndrome and un-derwent urgent decompressive surgery. Further oncological treatment was planned； however， she deteriorated rapidly following surgery， and repeat imaging showed progressive disease at the surgical site.

Distant metastases occur in approximately 10% of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma and are found at pre-sentation in half of these cases. Conversely， anaplastic thy-roid carcinoma behaves in an aggressive manner， typically presenting at an advanced stage， with a median overall sur-vival of 4 months2.\n\n【29】Transformation from a papillary to an anaplastic thyroid car-cinoma has been described in the literature， both local to the thyroid \\[3，4\\] and at a variety of distant sites \\[5-8\\]. Distant transformation， however， remains rare. We present a case of a radioiodine-sensitive papillary thyroid carcinoma transform-ing to an anaplastic thyroid carcinoma， presenting as a cau-da equina compression.\n\n【30】Case Report\n\n【31】A 67-year old woman presented with a 1-year history of back pain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an unstable fourth lumbar vertebral (L4) lesion with an associated patholog-ical fracture (Figure 1A). A fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed focal increased ac-tivity in the right lobe of the thyroid， a lumbar spinal mass，\n\n【32】and an FDG-avid left axillary lymph node. An ultrasound scan of the axilla and thyroid revealed several thyroid nodules (all U2 in appearance) and benign axillary lymph nodes. The pa-tient underwent an L4 corpectomy with L3 to L5 screw fixa-tion. The histopathology from the L4 lesion was consistent with a diagnosis of a follicular variant of papillary thyroid car-cinoma； immunohistochemistry was positive for pan-cytoker-atin， CK7， thyroglobulin， and TTF-1. No poorly-differentiated component was identified (Figure 2).\n\n【33】Based on the spinal pathology results， a total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection were performed. A 13-mm unifo-cal papillary carcinoma (unencapsulated follicular variant) in the left thyroid lobe was identified， which was narrowly but completely excised with no associated lymphovascular inva-sion. No poorly-differentiated or anaplastic components were present. The final staging was pT1bNxM1(bone) (TNM8) and the patient was started on supraphysiological doses of levo-thyroxine to suppress the TSH to less than 0.1mU/L\n\nAn ablative dose of radioiodine (3 GBq) was administered with uptake on the post-ablation |131 scan seen in the thyroid bed， ribs， right ilium， and sacroiliac joints and fourth lumbar vertebrae region. An initial stimulated thyroglobulin value was recorded as 207 320 ug/L (unstimulated， 12 479 ug/L). Following this， a course of external beam radiotherapy was delivered to the lumbar-sacral spine： 30 Gy in 10 fractions over 2 weeks. Four consecutive treatment doses of |131 (5.5\n\n【35】Figure 1.

(B) Sagital T2-weighted MRI of lumbar spine showing progressive disease， complex abscess formation， and cauda equina compression at L4 level at point of anaplastic thyroid cancer transformation.\n\n【36】Figure 2.

The post-therapy scans demonstrated persistent but reduced io-dine uptake within the L4 vertebrae and faint uptake within the right ilium and sacroiliac joint， with no abnormalities seen elsewhere on the associated single-photon emission comput-ed tomography scan， and stimulated thyroglobulin levels fall-ing to 226 ug/L (unstimulated thyroglobulin， 93 ug/L) at the time of the last therapeutic dose. The patient remained well and free of pain， with an unstimulated thyroglobulin record-ed at 69 ug/L at the most recent follow-up. Radioiodine dos-es had been well tolerated， but with some mild myelosuppres-sion (neutrophils of 1.27×10°/L). Therefore， a further treatment dose of |131 (5.5 GBq) was scheduled for when the bone mar-row counts had recovered.\n\n【38】Two months prior to the planned admission for radioiodine， the patient presented as an emergency to her local hospital with worsening back pain， urinary retention， and lower-limb weak-ness. Cauda equina compression at L3 to L5 was confirmed， and an emergency lumbar decompression was performed. The patient's recovery and rehabilitation after surgery were slow， with her experiencing general functional decline and failure to improve with therapy. Repeat imaging 2 weeks after surgery revealed rapid progressive disease， with a complex abscess formation in the lumbar spine at the site of surgery， causing recurrent tumor compression of the cauda equina (Figure 1B)， together with further multifocal disease in the subcutane-ous tissues， with the tumor seen emerging from the surgical wound and infiltration of both psoas muscles， resulting in hy-dronephrosis and multiple lung metastases. Histopathology examination from the lumbar spine showed a poorly-differ-entiated malignant tumor (Figure 3A). Immunohistochemical staining showed the tumor cells were strongly positive for Pax8 (Figure 3B)， a pan-cytokeratin stain (AE1/AE3)， and CK7(Figure 3C). There was also weak staining for GATA-3 and no\n\n【39】Figure 3. (A) Hematoxylin- and eosin-stained biopsy specimen from L4 vertebra (2020) showing a high-grade malignant tumor， x200 magnification.

The serum un-stimulated thyroglobulin level was 47.4 ug/L. In view of the pa-tient's rapid clinical deterioration， findings on imaging， histo-logical appearance， and immunophenotype， the features were felt to be consistent with a diagnosis of anaplastic carcinoma of the thyroid. The oncology and palliative care teams were involved，but， unfortunately， the patient was not fit for further oncological treatment and died in the hospital 5 weeks after surgery. The patient's overall survival from the time of ini-tial papillary thyroid cancer diagnosis was 3 years 3 months.\n\n【41】Discussion\n\n【42】Local transformation from differentiated papillary thyroid can-cer to anaplastic cancer within the thyroid gland is reasonably well reported in the literature \\[3\\]. Transformation in the cervical lymph nodes has also been described， and good outcomes for these patients following neck dissection have been reported \\[9\\].\n\n【43】Conversely， distant-site transformation has been less wide-ly reported and only described in case reports at a number of sites， including the retroperitoneum \\[8\\]， lungs \\[7\\]， pleura \\[10\\]， mandible \\[6\\]，and breast \\[11\\]. In all of these cases， the cancer behaved aggressively with associated rapid clinical deteriora-tion. The natural history from diagnosis of differentiated thy-roid cancer to anaplastic transformation in these reports ranged from 7 to 30 years. This contrasts with our patient's case， in which the time was shorter， at only 3 years， highlighting the unpredictable and individual nature of this disease process.\n\n【44】BRAF， p53， and TERT promotor mutations， among others， have been identified as important factors in the development of an-aplastic carcinoma that arise from existing well-differentiat-ed thyroid tumors such as papillary and follicular carcinoma. These mutations are thought to occur prior to transformation， as have been shown in both papillary and anaplastic compo-nents， and to indicate a worse prognosis in the differentiat-ed tumor， even in cases where anaplastic transformation did not occur \\[12，13\\]. Other studies have implicated 8 significant-ly altered markers between the 2 tumor types： upregulation of p53， MIB-1， and topoisomerase ll-a and downregulation of thyroglobulin， E-cadherin， B-catenin， Bcl-2， and VEGF in the an-aplastic tumor， compared with the differentiated tumor \\[14\\]. However， none of these mutations were tested in our patient in either tumor sample. Radioiodine (1131) has additionally been implicated as a potential causative factor in the development of p53 mutations in differentiated thyroid cancer \\[15\\].\n\n【45】There is also evidence suggesting early evolutionary divergence between the 2 tumor types， as it has been shown that many of the mutations identified in the respective tissue types do not overlap \\[16\\]. This challenges the more widely recognized hypothesis of transformation from a differentiated tumor to an undifferentiated one and suggests that perhaps the 2 tu-mors evolve separately. Alternatively， it may be that both hy-potheses hold true， and that in patients with coexistent dif-ferentiated and anaplastic thyroid tumors， some have evolved directly from the differentiated tumor， while others are part of a distinct evolutionary process and have simply occurred simultaneously in the same patient. The fact that our patient had biopsy-confirmed disease of both cancer types from the same site distant to the thyroid (L4 vertebra) does， however， seem to support a process of transformation in our patient.\n\n【46】The prognosis for anaplastic thyroid carcinomas is improving as newer targeted treatment options become available. Good response rates (overall response rates of 69%)， have been dem-onstrated in patients with tumors containing a BRAF V600E mutation who received dabrafenib and trametinib \\[17\\]，demon-strating the importance of early molecular testing in de novo an-aplastic tumors， but also in transformed differentiated tumors.\n\n【47】Conclusions\n\n【48】This is the first reported case of transformation from a papil-lary to an anaplastic thyroid carcinoma presenting as a cauda equina compression. Furthermore， many of the previously re-ported cases in the literature were diagnosed only at autop-sy， whereas our patient was still alive at the time of diagno-sis. This enabled essential communication with the patient and family， particularly involving discussions about prognosis and benefits of further treatment. This case highlights that ma-lignant transformation of papillary thyroid carcinoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis when the current presentation does not reflect the previous disease trajecto-ry. Further molecular profiling \\[18\\] may offer information on prognosis \\[19\\] and identify opportunities for newer targeted therapies \\[20\\] and perhaps should be considered early in a pa-tient's management course. However， our case also highlights the rapidity with which malignant transformation of a differ-entiated thyroid cancer can occur and prove fatal.\n\n【49】1\\. American Cancer Society.

It is considered a part of the clinical and pathological spectrum of diverticu-lar diseases \\[2\\]. It is defined as microperforation and inflam-mation of the peridiverticular wall， which develops due to in-creased pressure at the diverticular ostium， usually as a result of an obstructing fecalith. Typically， affected patients are di-agnosed by computed tomography， which is considered the criterion standard for diagnosis as well as for assessment of the degree of severity. Uncomplicated cases are usually man-aged conservatively by bowel rest and antibiotics. However， patients presenting with complicated disease such as perfo-ration， phlegmon， abscess， or fistulas， require more aggressive management， which includes surgical intervention to avoid life-threatening situations \\[3\\]. Moreover， this case highlights an en-tity of special importance - a foreign body-induced diverticu-litis - which has been documented in the literature. There are documented cases of recurrent diverticulitis refractory to con-servative management， which were later found to be triggered by foreign bodies that were not initially detected on imaging. This case highlights the importance of foreign body-induced diverticulitis， especially in the elderly， in whom a predispos-ing diverticulosis has a prevalence of 50% \\[4\\].\n\n【35】Case Report\n\n【36】A 73-year-old man with a past history of hypertension was admitted for a 1-year history of recurrent left lower quadrant pain. Twelve months before， the patient suddenly began ex-periencing abdominal pain in the left lower quadrant， which was burning， intermittent， and severe (scale 7-9/10)， some-times lasting several hours at a time. In addition， the pain was non-radiating， mildly relieved with NSAID， and exacer-bated by food intake. He had been admitted multiple times to several different hospitals with similar symptoms，leuko-cytosis， and elevated CRP. Abdominal CT scans had been re-peated several times during these admissions， showing evi-dence of acute sigmoid colon diverticulitis. He was discharged on several of these occasions on a 1-week course of cipro-floxacin and metronidazole， but had recurrence of symptoms， leading to readmission.\n\n【37】His most recent admission was to our hospital on 03/01/2017for a recurrence of abdominal pain that had lasted 2 weeks. Lab test results again showed leukocytosis and elevated CRP. The patient was prepared for colonoscopy due to suspicion of malignancy， which showed multiple diverticulae in the sigmoid and in an area of relative narrowing with impacted food seen in the mid-sigmoid. An abdominal CT scan with Ⅳ\n\n【38】Figure 1. Contrast-enhanced CT abdomen with coronal reconstruction showing the ingested foreign body as a bony attenuation in the sigmoid colon with the tip projecting beyond the bowel wall， and surrounding fat stranding suggesting inflammatory changes.\n\n【39】contrast was performed， showing an intraluminal， linear， for-eign body (Figure 1). The foreign body demonstrated a bony attenuation with a pointed tip transfixing the sigmoid wall at this level， with the tip seen outside of the lumen. It was sur-rounded by fat stranding and reactive inflammatory changes， as well as thickening of the sigmoid wall. A mild amount of fat stranding was also noted surrounding the sigmoid colon and extending to the urinary bladder wall， which appeared mildly thickened with shaggy borders. Multiple subcentimeter lymph nodes were also noted， with no evidence of diverticulitis on the exam. There was no evidence of an abscess， collection， or free fluid within the abdomen and pelvis.\n\n【40】Colonoscopy was later repeated with better preparation， show-ing multiple diverticulae in the sigmoid colon. An area of rela-tive narrowing was also seen within the mid-sigmoid. The for-eign body， however， was not visible on this exam， suggesting that the bone had migrated since the previous colonoscopy and additional preparation. A repeat CT abdomen was done following the second colonoscopy， which showed complete ab-sence of the previously visible foreign body.\n\n【41】The patient was discharged on 1 week of antibiotics and regular diet， and has since remained symptom-free with no complaints.\n\n【42】Discussion\n\n【43】the elderly (especially those who wear dentures)， and those with psychiatric disorders.\n\n【44】Most commonly， IFB are food particles， such as fish bones， chicken bones， or food fragments. Fortunately， most food par-ticles pass uneventfully. However， there are bony fragments that may lead to abdominal complications such as diverticu-litis， Gl perforation， and abscess formation. Gossypiboma， a surgical complication resulting from foreign materials left in the patient during the operation， was not the case in this pa-tient because there had been no recent surgery or any com-plication post-surgery \\[5\\].\n\n【45】Glasson et al. \\[6\\] reported a case with perforated sigmoid di-verticulum caused by a chicken bone. Akhtar et al. \\[7\\] report-ed 3 cases with bowel perforation caused by chicken bones：2 cases with a preceding hernia and the other with a preced-ing diverticulitis.\n\n【46】Most IFB cases are asymptomatic and are often found inciden-tally on abdominal imaging. When symptomatic， the most com-mon clinical findings are abdominal pain and fever.\n\n【47】These cases are very difficult to diagnose since the patient is unlikely to recall ingestion of the food particle.\n\n【48】What is interesting about this particular case is that the symp-toms of diverticulitis had been recurring for the past 8 months without diagnosis of an underlying cause. This is an example of the need for high clinical suspicion， especially in the elderly，\n\n【49】References：\n\n【50】1\\.

Physicians should have the clinical exper-tise to ask for the optimal medical imaging， which consists of a CT abdomen that will detect the bony lesion before any in-vasive procedure is performed.\n\n【61】Conflicts of interest\n\n【62】None.\n\n【63】5\\.

Open wounds having exposed bone can be managed by simple trephination of bone and split thickness grafting when complex coverage options like muscle flap or free flap are not possible. Case report： We present the case of a middle-aged woman who sustained a high voltage electrical injury to left upper limb and left lower limb. Amputation of the left upper limb was done with shoulder disarticulation and subclavian ligation. In the lower limb almost whole length of the tibia was exposed which was drilled and surrounding area was debrided and then regularly dressed with saline dressing. Follow up three months of saline dressing resulted in good granulated wound ready for coverage which was skin grafted and limb was saved. Conclusion： Open wounds with exposed bones should be adequately debrided， and the attempt of drilling can be given if better coverage option is available. It is also an option when the patient is at high risk for surgery. It can be done under local or no anaesthesia. Regular dressing with local debridement and maintaining proper Hemoglobin and protein throughout can help early wound closure.\n\n【4】KEYWORDS high voltage electrical injury， limb salvage， bone drilling， bone trephination， STG over bone， Shoulder disarticulation\n\n【5】INTRODUCTION\n\n【6】Contact electrical burns are more severe than other forms of contact burn injury. They lead to an array of complications that involve multiple systems， including cardiac arrhythmias and rhabdomyolysis.\\[1\\] In contrast to the medical complications， soft tissue injuries are devastating and surgically demanding.\\[1\\] The surgical treatments practised are escharotomy or fasciotomy， excisional debridement and limb amputation.

In the lower limb almost whole length of the tibia was exposed which was drilled and surrounding area was debrided later regular dressing done. Daily saline gauze dressings were done， and whenever required blood was transfused and high protein diet instituted. When the wound was ready， it was grafted. Successful grafting followed by graded physiotherapy， the patient was able to walk.\n\n【15】CASE REPORT\n\n【16】A 48-year-old woman coming from a village in Gujarat， sus-tained electrical burn injuries while hanging clothes using a metal pole on a wire， which accidentally landed on a high volt-age cable (11，000 V). She arrived in the emergency department in our hospital one day after the time of injury. On initial ex-\n\n【17】Figure 1 and 2： On presentation.\n\n【18】Figure 3 and 4： Post debridement and drilling of bone.\n\n【19】Figure 5 and 6： Post split thickness skin grafting.\n\n【20】Figure 7 and 8： One year follow up pictures after skin graft has settled.\n\n【21】amination， she had full thickness burn wounds all over the left upper limb and in the left lower limb below knee there was tis-sue loss exposing the whole length of the tibia， with movement present in the foot but no sensation. Thus， constituting 15 % of total body burns. The entry point of the electrical arc was at left palm， and exit point was shin of the left leg. Left upper limb was not viable up to shoulder joint， with no sensation， no capillary refill and no movement. She had myoglobinuria with 500cc dark red urine on presentation. Early wound care was done with liquid paraffin-based dressing. Blood results revealed severe rhabdomyolysis (creatine kinase level=26000 U/L) and acute kidney injury (139.6umol/L). Troponin T'was normal and an electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia， which ruled out cardiac injuries.\n\n【22】An emergency left upper limb shoulder disarticulation with subclavian ligation and debridement of lower limb wound was done in Operation Theater. In the postoperative period， Urine output was maintained at more than 1cc/kg/hour， and she had clear urine 36 hours after operation with a reduction of creatine kinase (CK) level from 26000U/L to 3000 U/L after five days. She underwent multiple debridements and bone trephination every 3 to 4 days from day 3 of her injuries. Mobility assessment revealed that plantar flexion was present in the foot. The de-brided wound developed an infection， and tissue cultures grew Pseudomonas， which was treated with intravenous Amoxycillin Clavulanate for two weeks. She eventually developed healthy granulating wound bed over the lower limb. The split skin graft was done after 12 weeks of dressing and it epithelized after a3-week stay in the hospital， and the patient was subsequently transferred to a rehabilitation unit to continue rigorous rehabili-tation and physiotherapy.\n\n【23】DISCUSSION\n\n【24】Electrical burns have an inherently different mechanism and dis-tribution of tissue injury as compared to thermal burns. While the majority of injuries following a thermal burn are clinically apparent whereas electrical burns may not be visible on initial clinical presentation.\\[3\\] Within 48 hours of injury， a compartment syndrome may develop in an involved extremity secondary to progressive myonecrosis as well as to fluid resuscitation. If not addressed promptly， increased interstitial pressure results in decreased perfusion of otherwise uninjured tissues， resulting in irreversible damage necessitating amputation.\\[3\\] Standard man-agement of severe extremity electrical injury includes early surgi-cal exploration， fasciotomy and debridement within 24 hours of injury. Early fasciotomy is defined as fasciotomy performed dur-ing a patient's first trip to the operating room.\\[4，5\\] It is warranted in patients with a high voltage electrical injury that is compli-cated by compartment syndrome of the affected body compart-ments. Rates of 10 to 50 percent of early fasciotomies performed within 24 hours for compartment release have been reported， and these have reduced the rates of limb amputations.\\[3，6-8\\]\n\n【25】However， immediate fasciotomy and decompression of mus-cle compartments of injured limbs are still controversial. Al-though some advocate this aggressive procedure to reduce the possibility of amputation， the approach may increase the num-ber of surgical interventions required and lead to soft tissue desiccation by exposing viable tissue.\\[9\\] According to Mann et al.， the ideal time to determine the extent of muscle injury is3-5 days after electrical injury. They presented an algorithm for selective decompression to prevent subsequent morbidity\\[2，9\\]\n\n【26】and reported that progressive neurologic deterioration (motor or sensory) of the extremity， severe pain in the extremity and loss of arterial Doppler signal indicating cessation of perfusion are strong indications for a fasciotomy.\\[2\\] When presented with a fixed neurological deficit， irreversible nerve damage should be considered as fasciotomy may not improve the outcome of restoring limb function.\\[2\\] Late signs of vascular and neurologi-cal compromise may also have a poorer outcome in limb salvage. Measurements of intra-compartmental tissue pressure using a needle， catheter or fibreoptic transducer may objectively indicate for an early fasciotomy when the pressure rises to more than30mmHg.\\[10\\] Pressure measurement， however， is not reliable for all patients with electrical injury of the extremities because oedema does not always occur in patients with normal superfi-cial but damaged deep muscles.\\[9\\] Other non-invasive methods to assist in the diagnosis of compartment syndrome include an ultrasonic device (measures submicrometric displacement of fascia caused by volume expansion)， near-infrared spectroscopy(tracking of variations in the oxygenation of muscle tissue) and laser Doppler flowmetry.\\[10，11\\] However， there are no studies to validate the accuracy of these non-invasive devices in diag-nosing compartment syndrome.\\[10\\]\n\n【27】Early fasciotomy releases the pressure within a compartment under tension and restores adequate perfusion to viable tissues， which prevents tissue necrosis. In marginally injured tissues seen in the zone of stasis surrounding the necrotic burn zones， early fasciotomy improves tissue perfusion and prevents fur-ther necrosis of burn tissue. The drawback of this procedure is that it exposes the tissues to desiccation and wound infec-tions.\\[2\\] In a relatively recent study， early fasciotomy was as-sociated with a significantly increased number of ICU days， ventilator days， hospital days， and a total number of surgical procedures when compared to patients who did not have early fasciotomy. Since it was associated with increased injury severity， early fasciotomy was also associated with a significant increase in amputation.\\[3\\] Nevertheless， the possibility of inadequate decompression following fasciotomy leading to avoid tissue des-iccation， subsequent wound sepsis and a protracted hospital course in patients requiring early fasciotomy， secondary wound closure is advocated on the third or fourth day with concurrent intra-compartmental pressure monitoring. Alternatives other than skin grafting for wound closure include intra-cutaneous skin sutures， skin stretching with mechanical closing devices， dynamic skin sutures， vacuum-assisted closure， and shoelace suturing techniques. When open wounds are encountered in lower limb as in this case， debridement should be generously done， and exposed bone should be given an attempt of drilling when other coverage options are not possible.\\[12\\]\n\n【28】CONCLUSION\n\n【29】Open wounds with bone exposed should are debrided correctly and attempt of drilling can be given if no coverage option avail-able. It is also an option when the patient is at high risk for surgery. It can be done under local or no anaesthesia. Regular dressing， local debridement and maintaining proper Hb and protein throug hout can help early wound closure.\n\n【30】TAKE HOME MESSAGE\n\n【31】In rural areas of Gujarat， the practice of using wires and met-als for wet hanging clothes is very common， public education regarding safety is necessary to prevent such burns incidents.\n\n【32】Prompt and early referral to the higher centre is necessary for limb and life salvage.\n\n【33】AUTHORS'CONTRIBUTIONS\n\n【34】Dr Hardik Dodia wrote the case report including performing the literature review.

The role of exercise is par-ticularly important in children and adolescents as their bone mineral density reaches 90% of its peak by the end of the second decade.\\[2-4\\] American College of Sports Medicine (ACMS) clas-sified physical activity intensity on the basis of maximal heart rate. For moderate-intensity physical activity， a target heart rate of a person should be 55% to 69% of his or her maximum heart rate.5\\]\n\n【18】Calcium has a crucial role in various physiological processes such as skeletal mineralization， blood coagulation， the excitabil-ity of skeletal， cardiac muscles， neuromuscular conduction，\n\n【19】maintenance of normal tone， maintenance of cell membrane integrity and permeability. \\[6\\] Ninety-nine percent of all body's calcium resides in the bone， and most of the calcium is present as hydroxyapatite. Bone is the reservoir for extracellular ions. Soluble intracellular calcium along with extracellular calcium constitutes 0.1% of the total body calcium content. \\[7\\]\n\n【20】Blood glucose levels are significantly decreased after exercise， indicating better glucose regulation due to changes in beta cell functioning.\\[8\\] Physical activity increases glucose uptake by active muscles and is balanced by hepatic glucose output. As the exercise intensity increases， this dependence of muscles on carbohydrates to fuel muscular activity also increases.\\[9A：G increases due to higher levels of albumin and decreased levels of globulin that are associated with physical exercise.\\[10，11\\] There is an increased rate of red blood cell turnover stimulated by exercise conditions such as muscle contraction and high oxygen with resultant elevation in bilirubin levels.\\[12\\]\n\n【21】Regular and moderate exercise has provided various ben-eficial health effects， including reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases， certain cancers， osteoporosis， and obesity.\\[13\\] NeV-ertheless， certain forms of exercise and particularly maximal exercise， are also accompanied by some deleterious effects. Mus-cle damage after exercise can result in a substantial increase in myocellular protein levels in the blood. Studies have shown that prolonged physical exercise results in transient elevations of biochemical markers of muscular damage such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST)， alanine aminotransferase (ALT)， crea-tine kinase (CK)， and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).\\[14，15\\]\n\n【22】Studies have shown that effect of exercise on biochemical parameters depends on exercise intensity， sex and age group. To the best of our knowledge， no such studies are available in the Indian context， especially in Haryana. The present study was conducted to study the alteration in routine biochemical param-eters after moderate physical exercise in healthy volunteers and to compare these parameters before exercise and after exercise.\n\n【23】Material and Methods\n\n【24】The present study was conducted in the Department of Bio-chemistry in collaboration with the Department of Community Medicine， Pt. B.D. Sharma PGIMS， Rohtak. Thirty female volun-teers without any menstrual irregularities in the age group 20-50years were enrolled， mainly hospital staff. Female volunteers with menstrual disorders， medication history， chronic diseases such as hyper/hypothyroidism， diabetes mellitus， hypertension， respiratory diseases were excluded from the study.\n\n【25】Methodology\n\n【26】Written informed consent was obtained from participants， and detailed history was taken. Complete general， systemic and physical examination was done along with anthropometric mea-surements and were recorded as per protocol. The study was approved by the ethical board of the institution. After proper informed written consent， six ml of venous blood sample was withdrawn before exercise in plain red vacutainer aseptically from the antecubital vein. After 15 minutes of rest， they per-formed moderate physical exercise in walking for 30 minutes. The second and third blood samples were collected after one hour and 24 hours of the exercise， respectively. In addition， two ml of blood sample was collected in purple capped vacu-tainer (EDTA) for haemoglobin. Samples were processed within one hour of collection， and serum was separated by centrifuga-tion (2000rpm X 10 minutes) after clotting and analysed on the\n\n【27】same day. Various routine biochemical investigations were per-formed on an auto-analyzer (RandoxSuzuka) using the standard enzymatic methods.\\[16\\] Electrolytes were measured using the Ion-selective electrodes method.\\[17\\]\n\n【28】Table 1： Comparison of routine biochemical parameters be-fore and after exercise\n\n【29】Result\n\n【30】The mean age of healthy female volunteers was 31.57±6.89 years. Out of 30 volunteers， the majority of volunteers， i.e. 13 (43.3%) females， were lab technicians， followed by 9 (30%) females who were bearers in hospital， 7 (23.3%) were staff nurses and one(3.3%) female was a sweeper in hospital. Height and weight in these women were 1.58±0.48 meters and 55.17±6.82kg， respec-tively. BMI was 22.09±2.38kg/m2. The mean value of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in fe-male volunteers fifteen minutes before exercise was 122.67±5.17mmHg and 78.40±2.76 mmHg， respectively. Pulse rate was recorded fifteen minutes before exercise and was 84.83+8.60beats/min. Various routine biochemical investigations were car-ried out before exercise and 1 hour & 24 hours after exercise and were compared using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)；(Table1). A significant decrease was found in levels of blood glucose， serum sodium and potassium， although they remained within normal range. The alterations in other routine parameters like serum urea， creatinine， uric acid， LDL and total cholesterol were insignificant.\n\n【31】Discussion\n\n【32】Physical exercise induces bone mass gain， especially in weight-bearing bone sites. Physical exercise improves bone formation and bone mineral density. Physical exercise exerts external as well as internal forces on the skeleton system. This causes a variable amount of deformation in bone tissue and produces mechanical strain sensed by osteocytes， mechanosensitive cells of the bone. Osteocytes then start an adaptive response with the help of the action of osteoclasts which cause resorption of bone tissue； and via osteoblasts that produce new bone tissue. Physical exercise has been proved to be advantageous for main-taining healthy，strong bones， particularly in children and ado lescents.18\n\n【33】A recent study has concluded that in adolescent and pre-pubertal girls， peak bone mass was effectively increased after exercise， especially after the bone loading exercises. They ob-served that two to four sessions of exercise for 30 min/day or less per week improved bone mass and that exercise provides lifelong protection against fracture in this age group.\\[19\\]\n\n【34】In the present study， a significant decrease was noted in blood glucose， serum sodium and potassium levels， although they re-mained within the normal range. Percentage fall in blood glu-cose levels after one hour of exercise was significant. Physical activity increases glucose uptake into active muscles balanced by hepatic glucose production， with more dependence on car-bohydrates to fuel muscular activity as the exercise intensity increases.\\[8\\] The present finding is consistent with Kraemer et al.， who showed a significant decrease in blood glucose values after exercise.\\[20\\]\n\n【35】Serum sodium levels were significantly lowered after one hour of exercise. This reduction in serum sodium level can be attributed to the loss of sodium in sweat during exercise.

It is stored with glycogen inside the muscle fibres and helps transport glucose into the muscle cells. A slight decrease in serum potassium can be due to sweating and exercise duration. However， prolonged exercise without any fluid intake with increased glycogen breakdown can contribute to increased serum potassium levels.\\[22\\] The alterations in other routine parameters like serum urea， uric acid， LDL and total cholesterol were insignificant.\n\n【38】Long term effects on the bone with repeated exercise could not be determined in the present study. Further investigations are required to elucidate the physiological and clinical signifi-cance of the observed changes in routine biochemical markers.\n\n【39】Conclusion\n\n【40】The present study showed that moderate physical activity has a significant effect on selected biochemical parameters. How-ever， effect of exercise on normal physiological functions and biochemical parameters can vary with different factors such as age & sex of subject， the intensity of exercise， duration of exercise& type of exercise. Further detailed studies with a larger sample size are recommended to support exercise programs.\n\n【41】Funding\n\n【42】This work did not receive any grant from funding agencies in the public， commercial， or not-for-profit sectors.\n\n【43】Ethics committee approval\n\n【44】The study was approved by ethical committee of institution with reference no-IEC/Th/17/Biochem/02.\n\n【45】Conflict of interest\n\n【46】There are no conflicts of interest to declare by any of the authors of this study.\n\n【47】References\n\n【48】1\\.

Here we describe the rare case of bilater-al subclavian artery stenosis in an asymptomatic patient.\n\n【17】Case Report：\n\n【18】Our patient was a 63-year-old chronic smoker with no prior medical history whose chief complaint was dys-pnea from an exacerbation of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was hypotensive with blood pressure 74/56 mmHg at admission， which raised suspicion for sepsis， adrenal insufficiency but the workup (renal panel， full blood count and synacthen tests) were normal. He quickly recovered after we treated his COPD exacerbation， but his hypotension persisted despite repeated fluid challenges. To evaluate for struc-tural causes of his hypotension， we performed a full cardiovascular examination with 4 limb blood pressure measurements and found upper limb hypotension and lower limb hypertension. Subsequent imaging with ul-trasound and computed tomography confirmed the presence of bilateral subclavian artery stenosis. Our diag nosis was thus bilateral subclavian artery stenosis secondary to atherosclerosis from chronic smoking. The pa-tient was subsequently referred to vascular surgery for consideration of surgical revascularization.\n\n【19】Conclusions：\n\n【20】Bilateral subclavian stenosis is extremely rare and requires a high index of clinical suspicion. Early diagnosis is important in the primary prevention of associated cardiovascular diseases.\n\n【21】MeSH Keywords： Atherosclerosis· Hypotension· Subclavian Steal Syndrome\n\n【22】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/918583\n\n【23】Subclavian stenosis is an uncommon condition associated with cardiovascular complications. Half of all patients with subclavian stenosis are found to have coronary artery dis ease while another one-third would develop carotid or verte-bral disease \\[1\\]. The left subclavian artery is more commonly affected than the right subclavian artery which branches from the innominate artery. Here， we present a rare case of bilat-eral subclavian stenosis in an asymptomatic individual with persistent hypotension.\n\n【24】Case Report\n\n【25】Patient A is a 63-year-old Malay male with a 50 pack-year smoking history and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD) who was admitted for an infective exacerbation of COPD. At the emergency department， he was breathless and hypotensive. His dyspnea improved with 2 cycles of nebu-lized salbutamol/ipratropium and a single dose of predniso-lone 30 mg. However， he was persistently hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation (Figure 1).\n\n【26】His clinical presentation of hypotension and COPD exacerba-tion raised initial suspicions of sepsis. Preliminary investiga-tions revealed mild hyperlactatemia (3.8 mmol/L). However， he was afebrile， non-toxic looking and his renal panel and in-flammatory markers were unremarkable (total white cell count：5.99x10° cells/L，C-reactive protein： 2.2 mg/L). Hence， systemic hypoperfusion was unlikely. Nonetheless， we proceeded fluid\n\n【27】challenges (6 pints of Hartmann’s over 24 hours) with limit-ed response (Figure 1).\n\n【28】Besides sepsis， we considered the differential diagnosis of hy-pocortisolism. His 8 am serum cortisol level was low (85 nmol/L) and synacthen test results were equivocal： serum cortisol rose from 129 (basal)>420 (30 minutes)>484 nmol/L (60 minutes). His inadequate synacthen response (below 500 nmol/L) was not significant， considering his recent prednisolone use might have blunted the response \\[2\\]. Furthermore， he did not exhib-it any signs of hypocortisolism such as postural giddiness and orthostatic hypotension. Hence， we ruled out the diagnosis of hypocortisolism. A repeat hypocortisolism screen at follow-up consult showed appropriate synacthen response： 190 (basal)>539 (30 minutes) >610 nmol/L (60 minutes).\n\n【29】To investigate for structural causes of his hypotension， we re-examined his cardiovascular system and noted differential puls-es and blood pressures. Bilateral radial， brachial， and posterior tibial pulses were not palpable while the carotid， femoral， pop-liteal， and the dorsalis pedis pulses were well-felt. Lower limb blood pressures were higher than those of upper limbs (left leg：151/79mmHg； right leg：152/75 mmHg； left arm： 106/69mmHg； right arm： 118/82 mmHg). Ultrasound duplex scan of neck ar-teries showed signs of left subclavian artery steal syndrome(Figure 2A， 2B). Retrograde flow pattern and increased flow velocity of 211 cm/sec were observed in the left vertebral and subclavian arteries respectively. For the right-sided arteries， nor-mal antegrade flow and triphasic waveform were noted in the vertebral and subclavian arteries respectively (Figure 2C， 2D).\n\n【30】Figure 1. Timeline of care showing the blood pressure trend with several episodes of hypotension despite multiple fluid challenges(represented as asterisk).\n\n【31】Figure 2. Ultrasound duplex scan of (A) left vertebral artery showing retrograde flow pattern and (B) left subclavian artery showing increased flow velocity of 211 cm/s (arrow) suggesting subclavian artery steal syndrome. (C) Right vertebral artery showed slightly reduced flow velocity and late-systolic deceleration which might be a sign of mild subclavian steal phenomenon and(D) right subclavian artery showed normal triphasic waveform.\n\n【32】Insignificant stenoses were demonstrated in bilateral common， internal and external carotid arteries.\n\n【33】To delineate the stenosis， we performed a computed tomogra-phy aortography of his thoracic aorta which showed extensive atherosclerotic stenosis of his proximal left subclavian artery from the origin， and focal stenosis of the right subclavian ar-tery (Figure 3A-3C). Prominent collaterals were noted around both subclavian arteries， suggestive of a chronic compensato-ry process. His superior mesenteric artery also demonstrated stenosis with the formation of multiple upper abdominal col-laterals. In view of the widespread arterial stenosis， we eval-uated for renal artery stenosis with ultrasound duplex of the renal arteries. No renal artery stenosis was detected.\n\n【34】Etiologies of subclavian stenosis included atherosclerosis， tho-racic outlet syndrome， and vasculitis such as Takayasu arteritis. Given his smoking history and thrombo-calcific appearance of\n\n【35】the lesions， we attributed his arterial stenosis to atherosclerosis and referred him to vascular surgery. His workup for diabetes and hyperlipidemia， and both screens， were normal (hemoglo-bin (Hb)A1c 5.6%； total cholesterol 3.91mmol/L； triglycerides0.97 mmol/L；low-density lipoprotein \\[LDL\\] 2.17 mmol/L). He was counselled on smoking cessation and initiated on both aspirin 100 mg OM (in the morning) and simvastatin 20 mg ON (in the evening) for primary prevention of cardiovascular complications. Revascularization was not offered due to the lack of ischemic symptoms.\n\n【36】Discussion\n\n【37】We present this case to highlight the importance of measuring blood pressure in all 4 limbs in patients with persistent asymp-tomatic hypotension. In most settings， unilateral upper limb blood pressure is measured. Discrepancies in the limb blood\n\n【38】Figure 3. (A) Computed tomography (CT) reconstructed and (B) CT coronal images showing left subclavian thrombosis and atherosclerosis (arrowheads)， right subclavian artery stenosis (arrow). (C) CT axial image showing right subclavian thrombosis (arrow) and collaterals from the costocervical trunk (arrowhead).\n\n【39】pressure are most commonly seen between the left and right arms. In a population-based study of 6814 participants with no known cardiovascular diseases， subclavian stenosis (interarm blood pressure difference of 15 mmHg or greater) was seen in less than 5% of the cohort \\[3\\]. All lesions were unilateral \\[3\\].\n\n【40】Bilateral stenosis is significantly less common. In a study on23 500 patients with cardiovascular risk factors， 272 patients\n\n【41】had subclavian artery stenosis or occlusion. Only 2 patients had bilateral stenosis (<0.1% of the study cohort)， with more advanced atherosclerosis seen in the left subclavian artery \\[4\\]. In unilateral stenosis， the left subclavian artery is more com-monly involved than the right \\[5\\]. Likewise， patient A had more extensive stenosis of the left subclavian artery and flow re-versal observed only in the left vertebral artery. The left sub-clavian artery originates at a more acute angle， which may\n\n【42】result in greater turbulence and accelerate the atherosclerot-ic process \\[6\\].\n\n【43】Subclavian stenosis can be diagnosed on indirect imaging such as duplex ultrasonography and computed tomography aortography. On duplex ultrasonography， subclavian stenosis manifests as increased systolic flow velocity and post-stenot-ic turbulence， as well as signs of subclavian steal syndrome. Subclavian steal syndrome is largely benign except in patients with high grade steal phenomenon (permanent retrograde flow through the entire cardiac cycle) \\[4，7\\]. These patients would experience symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency such as vertigo and syncope. A 56-year-old male with bilateral subcla-vian stenosis was reported to experience sudden onset of gid-diness and right arm tingling after self-administration of sub-lingual nitrate \\[8\\]. He developed refractory hypotension and was diagnosed with iatrogenic arterial hypotension. Inotropes were initiated followed by admission to intensive care unit. On repeat physical examination， bilateral lower limb hypertension and left carotid bruit were noted. Imaging of the subclavian arteries showed partial stenos is of the innominate artery and occlusion of the left subclavian artery. His innominate artery was revascularized and his giddiness resolved with residual right arm tingling. In another case of bilateral subclavian ste-nosis， a 71-year-old female with recurrent decompensations of her congestive heart failure (CHF) was admitted to the in-tensive care unit for inotrope support \\[9\\]. Initial differentials of the progressive CHF included infiltrative cardiomyopathies and myocarditis which were excluded on endomyocardial bi-opsy. The diagnosis became apparent when the blood pressure was measured via the femoral arterial line. Her femoral blood pressure (left leg： 170/80 mmHg) was raised in comparison to the brachial blood pressure (left arm： 83/74 mmHg； right arm： 60/39 mmHg). She was treated with anti-hypertensives in view of high femoral arterial blood pressure and unstable CHF. No further readmissions for decompensated CHF were noted thereafter. In contrast， patient A remained asymptom-atic despite high grade subclavian steal. His retrograde flow in the vertebral arteries might have been compensated by the abundance of collaterals and the preserved integrity of his ca-rotid arteries. Therefore， he did not require invasive interven-tion and was managed with primary prevention strategies.\n\n【44】Risk factors for subclavian stenosis included diabetes， hyperten-sion， hyperlipidemia and smoking \\[3\\]. Patients with significant\n\n【45】subclavian stenosis (greater than 50%) are predisposed to car-diovascular events such as myocardial infarction， and vertebro-basilar insufficiency-related conditions such as stroke \\[3，10，11\\]. Patients may not present with symptoms of claudication nor risk factors， as seen in our patient whose only risk factor was chronic smoking. A high degree of clinical suspicion is neces-sary to diagnose and workup for this condition.\n\n【46】A strength in our approach to the persistent hypotension was the revisiting of clinical history and physical examination.Our case report highlights the importance of a comprehensive car-diovascular physical examination which may be overlooked in the practice of modern medicine where laboratory and imag-ing services are readily available. His diagnosis would have been missed had we not repeated the blood pressure mea-surement on all 4 limbs. In retrospect， a potential setback in our pursuance of the hypotension was the issue of over-in-vestigation. The patient did not complain of any giddiness or claudication and had hitherto been functioning normally in his activities of daily living. The costly laboratory and imag-ing investigations would add substantial financial burden to the patient who was sustaining on daily allowances from his ageing mother. Nonetheless， early diagnosis and treatment of his atherosclerotic disease might be beneficial in reducing his risks for future cardiovascular events.\n\n【47】Conclusions\n\n【48】Early diagnosis is crucial for the primary prevention of poten-tial cardiovascular events. Useful clues as illustrated in this case study include the persistent of hypotension in an oth-erwise asymptomatic individual with cardiovascular risk fac-tors. Four limb blood pressure measurement should be rou-tinely performed in these patients \\[12\\].\n\n【49】Acknowledgements\n\n【50】We would like to thank the patient for consenting to the pub-lication of this case report and the Department of Internal Medicine， Seng Kang Hospital for its support in the publication.\n\n【51】Conflict of interests\n\n【52】1\\.

The mainstay oftreatment to achieve and maintain remission is 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). At least 20% of patients with UC experience an acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) flare， requiring aggressive early intervention to prevent complications. The first-line treatment of ASUC is intravenous steroids followed by infliximab or cyclosporin in patients for whom ste-roids fail. Refractory disease failing medical therapy and warranting surgery is common. Lately， Janus kinase(JAK) inhibitors， such as tofacitinib， filgotinib， and upadacitinib， have been licensed for moderate-to-severe UC in adults. Nevertheless， the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib in ASUC has not yet been established.\n\n【21】Case Report： We report a case of an 18-year-old woman with 4-year history of severe UC. Both infliximab and adalimumab treatments failed， despite the concurrent use of azathioprine， and she was reliant on steroids. Moreover， to-facitinib failed after 1 year of therapy. She was admitted as a case of ASUC. Flexible sigmoidoscopy confirmed severe pancolitis. Finally， she was treated effectively with oral upadacitinib 45 mg given once daily. She went into full clinical， biochemical， and steroid-free remission in 60 days and endoscopic remission at 180 days.\n\n【22】Conclusions： This case report features the potential safety and efficacy of upadacitinib in adults with ASUC. Larger trials are required to confirm the efficacy and safety in patients admitted with ASUC.\n\n【23】Keywords： Colitis ·Colitis， Ulcerative· Upadacitinib\n\n【24】Ful-text PDE https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/940966\n\n【25】23\n\n【26】Publisher's note： All daims expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of their affiliated\n\n【27】AP\n\n【28】organizations， or those of the publisher the editors and the reviewers.

It is believed to be the result of an interface between the immune system， environment， and intestinal microbiome in genetically predis-posed individuals. Abdominal pain， rectal bleeding， and diar-rhea are the most common symptoms of the disease. Early adulthood， ranging between 15 and 30 years of age， displays the highest incidence of UC. Prolonged treatment is usually re-quired to maintain the disease in remission； however， choos-ing the appropriate therapy depends on the severity of the dis-ease \\[1\\]. For mild-to-moderate disease， 5-aminosalicylic acid(5-ASA) and azathioprine are advised. Acute exacerbations of the disease， up to this time， are mainly treated with steroids. Regarding moderate-to-severe UC in adults， biologics， for ex-ample tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (anti-TNF)， specifically vedolizumab， and ustekinumab， are used \\[2\\]. At least 20% of patients with UC will develop acute severe ulcerative colitis(ASUC)， a life-threatening medical emergency， in the course of their illness， requiring early and aggressive intervention and hospitalization to prevent complications \\[3\\]. According to the Truelove and Witts criteria， ASUC is defined as a combination of 26 bloody stools with at least 1 of the following； pulse rate>90 beats per min， temperature >37.8℃， hemoglobin level of30 mm/h， erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) >30 mm/h， or C-reactive protein (CRP) level>30 mg/L \\[4\\]. The therapeu-tic options for ASUC are more limited， with corticosteroids re-maining the cornerstone of therapy for such flares， followed by infliximab or cyclosporine when corticosteroid treatment fails \\[3\\]. Additionally， tofacitinib， a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibi-tor， demonstrated promising results as a rescue therapy for adults with ASUC in whom the usual therapy with either inf-liximab or cyclosporin failed \\[5\\]. Upadacitinb，another JAK in hibitor， has been licensed for treating adults with moderate-to-severe UC； however， its safety and efficacy in ASUC has not yet been well established. In this paper， we present an 18-year-old woman， dependent on steroid treatment，who responded clinically， biochemically， and endoscopically to oral upadaci-tinib 45 mg once daily. She went into steroid-free remission and avoided proctocolectomy， which was offered for her as a salvage therapy. This case features the potential safety and efficacy of upadacitinib for treating ASUC.\n\n【30】Case Report\n\n【31】A 18-year-old woman with a known case of severe UC with a4-year duration was admitted for a flare. At the time of diag-nosis in December 2019， at the age of 15 years， she presented with severe UC that was steroid-resistant. She started induction therapy with infliximab (10 mg/kg) and showed a resolution of her symptoms. For about 6 months， she was maintained in\n\n【32】remission using both infliximab 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks and azathioprine 2.5 mg/kg. She was steroid free， and her body mass index (BMI) improved from 17.3 kg/m² at the time of di-agnosis to 19.3 kg/m?on therapy. However， in June 2020， she was readmitted for an exacerbation of her disease， with a BMI of 17.3 kg/m² once again. As per protocol， infectious workup was conducted and came back negative for Clostridium difficile and cytomegalovirus colitis. The diagnosis of severe pancolitis(Mayo 3， involvement of the entire colon) was confirmed by flexible sigmoidoscopy. Further workup assessing her infliximab drug level and antibodies was performed. Results came back as an undetectable infliximab drug level and a high level of anti-bodies against infliximab (30 AU/mL， normal reference range<5 AU/mL)， presenting a picture of secondary non-response because of immunogenicity. Clinical remission was achieved after starting her on a tapering course of prednisone 40 mg. To maintain remission，which was achieved for 9 months，inf-liximab was substituted for adalimumab 40 mgevery 2 weeks subcutaneously with azathioprine (2.5 mg/kg). Unfortunately， in March 2021， at the age of 17 years， the patient presented with another relapse. The diagnosis of severe pancolitis， in-volvement of the entire colon， was established by flexible sig-moidoscopy. Once more， her infectious workup was negative. Based on therapeutic drug monitoring， her dose of adalim-umab was boosted to 40 mg weekly and ultimately to 80 mg weekly， given her drug level was sub-standard (5 ug/mL) and owing to the presence of antibodies (5 AU/mL). Another pred-nisone 40 mg tapering course was offered， although complete wean off was not possible， as the patient developed rapid re-lapse once the prednisone dose reached 15 mg/day. Her adali-mumab level at the time was therapeutic (12 ug/mL)； however， adalimumab antibodies reached 20 (reference range <10 AU/mL). Her laboratory test results revealed the following： white blood cell count 4.6 (reference range 3.9-10×10/L)， microcyt-ic anemia (hemoglobin 81 g/L and mean corpuscular volume71.6 fL)， platelet count of 362 000 mcL， and hypoalbuminemia(albumin 28 g/L). Her inflammatory markers were as follows：CRP level of 110 mg/L and ESR of 74 mm/hr. A trial of a to-tal exclusive enteral nutrition diet was offered to the patient by our dietician， with no success. At this stage， our colorec-tal surgeons advised for proctocolectomy； however， it was re-fused by the patient's parents (BMI was still at 17.3 kg/m).\n\n【33】Other medical alternatives on an off-label use were discussed with the patient’s parents， owing to the complexity of her case. Since both vedolizumab and ustekinumab are not approved for pediatrics with UC， her medical insurance company declined them. Tofacitinib， a pan-JAK inhibitor approved for adults with UC and pediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis， was offered as a possible salvage therapy. It was explained to the patient and her family that it is not yet licensed for pediatrics with UC， but they agreed to give it a trial.

(D) The sigmoid after 6months of upadacitinib， with no ulcerations.\n\n【37】was obtained from the patient and her parents， since she was under 18， and the drug was funded to the patient by a pa-tient funding organization. Her lipid profile and cardiopulmo-nary status were both assessed and were normal， confirming the presence of no contraindications to try tofacitinib. More importantly， regarding her varicella zoster status， it was con-firmed that she had varicella zoster infection when she was5 years old and she was vaccinated fully up to her age. Oral tofacitinib 5 mg given twice daily was started and clinical re-mission was accomplished. She was able to taper off ste-roids with no recurrence of her symptoms. Clinical， biochemi-cal， and endoscopic remission was achieved at 9 months. Her follow-up CRP level was 5 mg/L， and fecal calprotectin level declined from >1000 ug/g to 110 ug/g. Her BMI improved to\n\n【38】21.2 kg/m2. Remarkably， clinical and endoscopic remissions were sustained for 12 months.\n\n【39】A year later， at the age of 18 years， in November 2022， she was admitted to the hospital with ASUC. She presented with abdominal pain associated with 9 episodes of bloody diarrhea per day. Her laboratory test results on admission showed a hemoglobin level of 95 g/L and CRP level of 75 mg/L and all infectious and stool workups were negative. She underwent sigmoidoscopy to confirm the diagnosis， which revealed se-vere pancolitis (Mayo 3， involvement of the entire colon) with numerous pseudopolyps (Figure 1A， 1B). Intravenous meth-ylprednisolone was started and the tofacitinib dose was in-creased in an attempt to control the flare (10 mg 3 times daily).\n\n【40】Three days after admission and treatment， the patient was still passing 9 bloody diarrhea per day and her CRP level remained elevated， at 55 mg/L The patient did not want to receive cy closporine owing to its adverse effects and her previous aza-thioprine failure history. Once more， the patient and her par-ents were advised to do colectomy， but refused surgery. Other salvage medical options were searched for as per the request of the patient and the patient's parents. Upadacitinib 45 mg orally once daily was started after a thorough informed con-sent， discussing the risks， benefits， adverse effects， and off-label use. As early as 3 days after the start of treatment with upadacitinib， her bowel movement improved to 3 bloody diar-rhea per day， and she was switched to oral prednisone. Seven days after therapy， she was passing 2 watery， non-bloody bow-el movements per day， and her CRP level improved to 25 mg/L On discharge， she was given upadacitinib 45 mg orally once daily and a prednisone 40-mg tapering course. On her 60-day follow-up appointment， she was remarkably doing well， with normal bowel movements， a BMI of 22.2 kg/m?， CRP level of5 mg/L， and fecal calprotectin level of 181 ug/g. To maintain the patient in remission， the upadacitinib dose was reduced to 30 mg orally once daily. Six months later， she underwent colonoscopy to confirm endoscopic remission， which revealed restored healthy mucosa throughout the colon (Mayo 0)， with mild loss of erythema in the sigmoid colon (Mayo 1). Biopsies obtained from the colon revealed dormant chronic colitis in the rectum (Figure 1C， 1D).\n\n【41】Discussion\n\n【42】In this case， we used upadacitinib， a once-daily oral selective JAK1 inhibitor， for an 18-year-old woman with ASUC flare with a loss of response history to tofacitinib， a pan-JAK inhibitor， after 1 year of therapy. No studies up to this time have thor-oughly elucidated the use of upadacitinib in ASUC； however， given its established effectiveness in tofacitinib-experienced adult patients with moderate-to-severe UC， we decided to of-fer it to our patient after exhausting all therapeutic options\\[6-8\\]. Clinical improvement was evident as early as 1 week af-ter starting treatment，and clinical/biochemical remission was seen at week 8，avoiding proctocolectomy.\n\n【43】With regards to the treatment of ASUC， which is considered a life-threatening medical emergency requiring hospitalization， it is worth mentioning the current management recommen-dations among the adult population， which includes the use of steroids as the first-line therapy， followed by rescue thera-py with either cyclosporin or infliximab in patients for whom steroid treatment failed after a period of 3 to 5 days \\[3\\]. The choice of using either cyclosporin or infliximab depends sole-ly on physician preference and their availability， as there is no difference in efficacy between the 2 agents， according to the\n\n【44】CySIF and CONSTRUCT trials \\[9，10\\]. It is imperative to not for-get the importance of starting patients on thromboprophylaxis， as inflammatory bowel disease is considered an independent risk factor for thromboembolism \\[11\\]. Surgery conducted in a3-step approach， starting with subtotal colectomy and loop il-eostomy， followed by ileal pouch anal anastomosis， and final-ly ileostomy reversal， remains the last resort when medical therapy fails， as the failure rate remains high， reaching 20%to 40%， demonstrating the important role of colorectal sur-geons and the importance of involving them in the manage-ment of ASUC early in the course \\[12，13\\].\n\n【45】In contrast to the use of upadacitinib to treat ASUC， its effec-tive and safe use in treating moderate-to-severe UC has been well established in several studies. The comprehensible phase2b U-ACHIEVE induction (UC1) trial established great evidence about upadacitinib efficacy in treating adults with moderate-to-severe UC who developed insufficient response， loss of re-sponse， or intolerance to steroids， immunosuppressive agents， and/or biologics. The aforementioned study has shown a posi-tive dose-response relationship between multiple upadacitinib doses， 7.5 mg， 15 mg， 30 mg， and 45 mg once daily， at induc-ing remission， the primary outcome， compared with placebo at8 weeks \\[6\\]. Studies showed that the symptomatic relief from UC symptoms was evident as early as 1 to 3 days after start-ing treatment with upadacitinib \\[14\\]. Similarly， our patient re-ported improvement in her symptoms 3 days after starting on upadacitinib 45 mg orally once daily， avoiding colectomy once again， which was excluded according to her wishes.\n\n【46】Upadacitinib is licensed as a therapy for adults with rheuma-toid arthritis， psoriatic arthritis， ankylosing spondylitis， and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis， with its efficacy and safety being well elaborated in these disease entities \\[15，16\\]. Despite the dose of upadacitinib，45 mg once daily， being high-er than the induction dose indicated for diseases other than inflammatory bowel disease， it established the secondary out-come of endoscopic improvement and remission， displaying a prime benefit-risk profile， high efficacy， and no significant in-crease in clinically related safety events in comparison with lower doses， which was confirmed in the U-ACCOMPLISH (UC2) phase 3 trial， promoting its selection as the optimal induction dose. A total of 451 patients from the previous trials who at-tained clinical remission after an 8-week induction therapy with upadacitinib 45 mg once daily were randomly assigned to obtain a maintenance dose of upadacitinib of either 15mg， 30 mg， or placebo once daily for a duration of 52 weeks in the U-ACHIEVE maintenance (UC3) trial. The principal out-come of the UC3 study， clinical remission， clinical response，and endoscopic and histological improvement at 52 weeks， was achieved by 63 (42%) of 149 patients receiving upadacitinib15 mg once daily， 80 (52%) of 154 receiving upadacitinib 30mg once daily， and 18 (12%) of 149 receiving placebo (adjusted\n\n【47】treatment difference of 30.7%\\[95%CI 21.7-39.8\\] for upadaci-tinib 15 mg vs placebo， P<0.0001； and 39.0%\\[29.7-48.2\\] for upadacitinib 30 mg vs placebo， P<0.0001) \\[17\\]. After these thorough trials， the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency licensed the drug for the treat-ment of adults with moderate-to-severe UC\n\n【48】In addition to the previous major trials， a prospective real-world single-center analysis of 18 patients with UC in whom treat-ment with tofacitinib and at least 2 biologics had failed con-cluded that upadacitinib is an effective treatment for moderate-to-severe UC. The study established this after close follow-up of those patients after starting upadacitinib， confirming clini-cal，steroid-free， and biochemical remission at 8 weeks \\[8\\]. In our case， we accomplished clinical， steroid-free， and biochem-ical remission at 8 weeks after starting the patient on upa-dacitinib 45 mg orally once daily and endoscopic remission at180 days after the start of treatment.\n\n【49】As the rates of colectomy in adults with ASUC remain high， there is an ongoing need to evaluate novel medical therapies that could delay surgical intervention and increase survival without the need for surgery \\[18\\]. A systemic review includ-ing 148 adult patients assessing tofacitinib，a JAK inhibitor，as a rescue therapy for treating adults with ASUC in whom ste-roid， infliximab， or cyclosporin treatment failed and who were deemed to require colectomy， demonstrated high short-term colectomy-free survival among such patients. The study dis-played a promising outcome for tofacitinib as a rescue ther-apy for adults with ASUC \\[5\\]. Similarly， the results were con-firmed by another systemic review published in June 2023that incorporated 2 observational studies， 7 case series， and5 case reports， with a total of 134 adult patients with ASUC who were treated with tofacitinib. The study reported a col-ectomy-free rate of 79.9% (95% Cl73.1-86.7) at 90 days and a colectomy-free rate of 71.6% (95%CI 64-79.2) at 6 months. Once again， the study established the effectiveness of tofaci-tinib in ASUC \\[231.\n\n【50】Due to the complexity of JAK signaling， healthcare provid-ers should consider the detrimental effects related to the use of JAK inhibitors， as they are quite common. These include headache， nausea， arthralgia， increased low-density lipopro-tein levels， infections， mainly varicella zoster， thrombosis， cre-atine phosphokinase elevation， neutropenia/lymphopenia， and acne \\[17，19，20\\]. Our patient had her vaccination against\n\n【51】References：\n\n【52】1\\. Kappelman MD， Rifas-Shiman SL， Kleinman K， et al.

Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol.2007；5(12)：1424-29\n\n【54】shingles， her lipid profile was normal during her regular check-ups， and she showed no adverse effects specific to the drug throughout treatment.\n\n【55】In 2021， after the results of a randomized control trial study ing adults with rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate，compar-ing tofacitinib with an TNF inhibitor， the FDA updated the re-cord of adverse effects linked to the use of tofacitinib，adding to it the elevated risk of cardiovascular events， malignancy， thrombosis， and death. This was done after revealing a high-er risk of acquiring the aforementioned risks in patients re-ceiving tofacitinib. Therefore， physicians should educate pa-tients thoroughly about these detrimental events and advise them to carefully outweigh the risks and benefits when con-sidering tofacitinib. Upadacitinib safety concerns were not studied in depth compared with those of tofacitinib； howeV-er， since upadacitinib descends from the same drug class as tofacitinib and shares the same mechanism of action， it was deemed necessary for the FDA to include upadacitinib in this update with the presumption of it having the same adverse effects. The inclusion criteria of the above-mentioned trial was age 50 years or older and a minimum of 1 cardiovascu-lar risk factor， including smoking， hypertension， diabetes mel-litus， and previous heart attack \\[21，22\\]. Since our patient was younger than 50 years and had no cardiovascular risk factors， the above-mentioned adverse effects were less feared. Based on our case， upadacitinib 45 mg orally once daily monother-apy， similar to tofacitinib， revealed promising results to sup-port the role of upadacitinib in achieving clinical response and remission in adults with ASUC， avoiding the need for the ulti-mate cure， proctocolectomy， and its sequelae.\n\n【56】Conclusions\n\n【57】Upadacitinib， showing promising outcomes in ASUC， can be considered as a salvage therapy on an off-label use for adults with ASUC for whom biologic treatment failed. Therefore， ran-domized controlled trials are required to determine its effica-cy and safety.\n\n【58】Declaration of Figures’ Authenticity\n\n【59】All figures submitted have been created by the authors who confirm that the images are original with no duplication and have not been previously published in whole or in part.\n\n【60】2\\.

It is characterized by a peri-pheral blood eosinophilia and infiltration of eosino-phils involving the skin， cardiac， respiratory， gastro-intestinal， and neurological systems \\[1\\]. Idiopathic HES varies from an asymptomatic phenomenon to a life threatening multisystem disease \\[2\\].\n\n【22】CASE REPORT\n\n【23】A 33-year-old woman was admitted with the symp-toms of mild fever， cough， dyspnea on exertion and erythematous， pruritic papules on the face， trunk and extremities for 3 months. She reported a history of mild， persistent asthma for 6 years， without regular therapy. Physical examination revealed subfebril fever， erythematous maculopapular rashes on trunk and ex-tremities. She had numerous enlarged cervical， axil-lary and inguinal lymph nodes. Many of these nodes were approximately 1 cm in diameter. The remaining physical examination was normal. Complete blood count (CBC) revealed that white blood cells (WBC)， platelets and hemoglobin (Hb) values were 28，690/mm'， 295，000 /mm'and 11， 8 g/dl， respectively. The differential leucocyte count showed 12% neutrophils，11% lymphocyte， 64% eosinophils， 12% monocytes， and 1% basophil. Peripheral blood eosinophils did not show any degranulation that was suggestive of a malignant eosinophilic disorder. Bone marrow as-piration and biopsy were performed. These studies revealed hypercellular marrow with diffuse infiltra-tion of mature eosinophils， which occurs 90% of all nucleated cells (Figure 1).\n\n【24】There was no increase in monocyte， blast cells and also there was no evidence of myelodysplasia，\n\n【25】Figure 1. Bone marrow biopsy demonstrates intense eosinophilic infiltration (HE stain，X400).\n\n【26】lymphoma or metastatic tumor. Liver and renal function tests were present within reference limits. C-reactive protein value was 105 mg/dl，erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 60 mm/h， immunoglobulin E (IgE) level 1120 IU/L and lactic dehydrogenase377 U/L. Rheumatoid factor， antinuclear antibody， antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) were analysed by both immunofluorescence and ELISA， and were negative. ANCA was repeated another laboratory and found as negative. Chest radiograph showed interstitial changes at both bases and lung spirometry revealed a mild obstructive pattern. High-resolution computerized tomography (CT) of the thorax revealed two nodules， one of them was in the right middle lob approximately 5 mm in diameter， and the other one was in the right lower lobe in 10 mm diameter and a segmental atelectasis in the left middle lobe. In addition to these findings， she had also peri-cardial effusion of 6-8mm shown by two-dimensional echocardiography. The electrocardiogram was normal. Ejection fraction was 70% and a mild mitral insuf-ficiency was found. Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed mild hepatomegaly (179 mm in diameter). CT scan of the brain was normal for vasculitis and involvement of HES. Skin biopsy showed no evidence of vasculitis， and direct immunofluorescence studies were negative. Karyotype analysis and cytogenetic studies based on FISH did not observe abnormalities. In addition to eosinophilia mild monocytosis also was attracted the attention in this period. We didn’t find any etiologic reason because monocytosis was investigated extensively. There were no parasites in the blood smear and feces. Repeated examinations of stool were negative for any ova or cyst. Serologic tests for fasciolosis，echinococcal infections， viral hepatitis， Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)， cytomegalovirus (CMV)， and toxoplasma were all negative. Mantoux test and sputum for acid-fast bacilli were negative.\n\n【27】Seven months after the beginning of her initial com-plaints she was given oral prednisolone in a dosage of1 mg/kg/day for the probable diagnosis of HES com-plicated by pericardial involvement. Dosage of pred-nisolone was slowly reduced to a maintenance dose of5 mg alternate day within two months. A remarkable clinical improvement was observed. CBC carried out after 4 weeks of the treatment and it caused WBC11.840 /mm ； 12% eosinophils and 18% monocytes values. Eosinophil values returned to normal (3%) stages at the 3month of the treatment. Eosinophils in bone marrow reduced to 10% in the 3° month. Interestingly， no decrease was detected in monocyte count in both blood smear and bone marrow. In con-trast to decrease in eosinophils， there was an increase in monocytes in both peripheral blood smear (43%) and bone marrow at 3 month of treatment without\n\n【28】any blast. Cutaneous manifestations and enlarge-ment of lymph nodes were disappeared within two months. Echocardiography showed no pericardial ef-fusion on 2month. However， the findings of thorax CT after three months remained unchanged. Today，12 months after the diagnosis of HES， the patient is still remaining clinically asymptomatic. WBC， Hb and ESR values in the last laboratory investigation were 10.900/mm'， Hb 12.3 g/dl and 18mm/h. The differential leucocyte counts were 39% neutrophils，18%lymphocyte， 2% eosinophils， 40% monocytes， and 1% basophil.\n\n【29】DISCUSSION\n\n【30】The most severe nonmalignant form of eosinophil-mediated disease is idiopathic HES. The other causes of eosinophilia must be excluded before making the diagnosis of HES. HES is defined by three criteria； persistent blood eosinophilia of > 1.5 X 10° /l for at least 6 months， no apparent cause for the eosino-philia， and eosinophilic end-organ damage \\[3，4\\]. The presented case was fulfilled all of the main criteria of HES. Etiological factors for eosinophilia and monocytosis were excluded before coming to diagnosis. These are included to screen for systemic lupus erythematosus， Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS)， parasitic infections， tuberculosis， sarcoidosis，leukae-mia and lymphoma.\n\n【31】The presented patient had skin， pulmonary， bone marrow and cardiac involvement. In one review， 56%of HES patients were reported to develop cutaneous manifestations including erythematous pruritic papules and nodules， angioedema and urticarial plaques \\[1\\]. Cardiac damage is the commonest cause of morbidity and mortality in HES. Cardiac involvement which was seen more than 60% of patients with HES may include endocardial damage and eosinophil infiltration of the myocardium， thrombi formation along damaged endo-cardium or on valve leaflets and progressive scarring that may lead to endomyocardial fibrosis producing a restrictive cardiomyopathy \\[5-7\\]. On the other hand， pericarditis or pericardial effusion is arare finding and as initial clinical manifestation of HES which was also reported \\[8\\]. In our patient， pericarditis was also one of the initial clinical findings， which is similar with the report by Sequra et al. \\[8\\]. Her presentation with pericardial effusion without cardiac failure was in-teresting. The other causes of pericarditis were excluded. Fortunately， pericardial effusion disappeared with corti-costeroid treatment. In contrast to the report by Spiegel et al. \\[9\\] cardiac tamponade didn’t develop.\n\n【32】Pulmonary involvement could be seen in 40%-60%of cases. The most common respiratory symptom of\n\n【33】the disease is chronic and persistent cough. Patients may be misdiagnosed as having asthma. However， pulmonary function tests typically reveal no airflow limitation \\[10\\]. Although bronchospasm has been noted to occur in HES， sporadic cases of asthma have also been reported to accompany HES \\[11，12\\]. In our patient， pulmonary involvement was established by means of pulmonary function tests， which showed an obstructive pattern. We considered that the findings of thorax CT were compatible with HES. However， asthma clinic in our patient， which began six years before was considered as a sporadic case of asthma accompanying HES.\n\n【34】Another interest point on the current case was en-countered difficulty in the differential diagnosis Although the differential diagnosis of hypereosino-philia includes parasitic infection， drug reactions， respiratory disease including CSS and pulmonary eo- sinophilia， solid tumoS1nurs， myeloproliferative disease and lymphoproliferative disease \\[5\\]， two main clinical pictures must be considered in this patient， chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL)， especially chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and CSS \\[3， 6\\]. Our pa-tient responded well to corticosteroid treatment and had no blastic transformation of eosinophils in pe-ripheral blood smear and bone marrow. In addition， cytogenetic analysis did not show any abnormality. In recent reports \\[13\\]， the identification of FIP1-like-1-platelet-derived growth factor receptor-o (FIPILI-PDGFRA) in cases of HES/CEL adds to a growing list of activated fusion tyrosine kinases linked to the pathogenesis of chronic myeloproliferative disorders. Unfortunately these studies couldn’t be done in the present case because of laboratory insufficiency. The FIP1L1-PDGFRo fusion protein transforms hema-topoietic cells， and its kinase activity is inhibited by imatinib \\[13\\]. CSS is a major cause of vasculitis asso-ciated with eosinophilia. Asthma and an elevated IgE level can be found either with HES or CSS. Although vasculitis is not a predominant feature of HES as it is with CSS， patients with HES may exhibit pathological evidence of vasculitis \\[14\\]. CSS may involve similar organs to those affected by HES. However， negative ANCA test and skin biopsy， and the presence of bone marrow findings in our patient helped to distinguish HES from CSS. A recent study was reported ANCA positivity as 38% in patients with CSS \\[15\\]. Although ANCA-negative CSS was reported and associated with heart disease and fever in this study， we think that rule out CSS with upper findings.\n\n【35】In the treatment of HES， corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment \\[16\\]. Our case responded well to corticosteroid treatment. Physical examination re-turned to normal. Since， enlargement of lymph nodes\n\n【36】was disappeared， we didn’t perform lymph node biopsy. It is reported that patients who respond well to corticosteroids tend to have a better prognosis \\[5\\]. Recent reports indicate that HES and CEL are imati-nib-responsive malignancies， with rapid and complete hematologic remissions observed at lower doses than used in chronic myelogenous leukemia \\[13\\]. However， we consider that our patient has a good prognosis. Therefore we needn't another therapy.\n\n【37】Although clinical and laboratory findings are markedly improved with this treatment， the unexpected event for us was the presence of monocytosis in peripheral blood smear， bone marrow aspirate and biopsy sample. Fortunately， there was no blast and evidence of myelo-dysplasia. Since absence for evidence of myelodisplasia flow cytometry analysis didn’t perform. The causes of monocytosis including chronic infections (ie. tuber-culosis， brucellosis)， leukemia， lymphoma， collagen vascular disease， sarcoidosis， and inflammatory bowel disease were investigated. However， no evidence of clinical and laboratory for these diseases were found.\n\n【38】REFERENCES：\n\n【39】1\\. Chusid MJ， Dale DC， West BC， WolfSM.

However， in a small proportion of pa-tients with preleukemia， monocytosis may be the most striking blood cell abnormality for months to years before the development of acute leukemia \\[17-19\\]. Therefore， we still carefully follow up for monocytosis. She has been taking 5 mg prednisolone daily although the findings of thorax CT are on going with her.\n\n【55】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【56】HES can be present with multiple organ involvement. Physicians should consider HES in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with cutaneous and respiratory manifestations， pericarditis and eosino-philia. As in our case， other comorbidities such as asthma could mask the accurate diagnosis of HES with pulmonary involvement. These patients require a detailed diagnostic examination and a careful fol-low up whether they can develop any other organ dysfunction. However， monocytosis in our case needs still to be clarified.\n\n【57】11\\. Winn RE， Kollef MH， Mayer JI. Pulmonary involvement in the hypereosinophilic syndrome. Chest 1994； 105： 656-60.\n\n【58】12\\.

He has undergone an operation for appendicitis 8 years ago， and a hernia11 years ago. In the operation， inflammation and edema in cecum region， dilatation in cecum and the terminal ileum were found and 1 cm diverticulum was removed.

Mail： nuraydinozlem@hotmail.com\n\n【22】The diverticulitis of the right colon is generally mis-diagnosed and sometimes mistreated \\[1，2\\]. Isolated cecum or ascending colon diverticulitis is rare and frequently discovered unexpectedly at urgent surgical interventions for suspected acute appendicitis. The etiology of the pain in the low right quadrant of the abdomen should be assessed comprehensively. Unless confirmed non-operatively or intra-operatively， it should be confirmed post-operatively； and upon mak-ing the correct diagnosis， it should be treated in an appropriate way even if it may be late. The surgeons who consider and make judgements on alternative diagnosis can make the intra-operative diagnosis and manage appropriate treatment； differential diagnosis with neoplastic process is not easy 3\\].\n\n【23】This case report aims to present a review of the literature concerning the right-sided colonic diver-ticulitis. It also points out that it should be kept in mind for patients admitted to the hospital with right lower abdominal pain who underwent an appendec-tomy before and the etiology of the pain remains unidentified.\n\n【24】In our case the cecal diverticulitis has been diagnosed in the microscopic examination following the opera-tion. Misdiagnosed of true cecal diverticulitis for two times has not been reported in the literature.\n\n【25】CASE REPORT\n\n【26】A 49-year-old male patient was admitted to our department with a right lower quadrant abdominal pain that has been persistent for 2 days. Constipation\n\n【27】Figure 1，2. The air-contrast barium enema (ACBE) in the postoperative period demonstrating colonic diverticuli.\n\n【28】and loss of appetite were present， while fever， chills， nausea and vomiting were absent. He has undergone an operation for a bilateral inguinal hernia 8 years ago and appendicitis 11 years ago. He was a smoker. During an abdominal physical examination， there was pain in the right lower quadrant， peritoneal tender-ness and rebound tenderness. Guarding was present in the right epigasrium. Also three abdominal inci-sion (bilateral inguinal and one McBurney’s incision) scars were present. The laboratory findings were in normal ranges， while white blood cell count (WBC) was 15 500 /mm. The abdominal ultrasonography(USG) showed 6-7 cm aperistaltic and edematous colon segment. The double contrast abdominal Cat Scan (CT) could not be performed； as this examina-tion is beyond routine policlinic hours of the hospital， it was unavailable. The exploratory laparotomy has been performed by the right paramedian incision under general anesthesia. Inflamation， edema and dilatation in cecum and terminal ileum has been found， and 1 cm diverticulum at posterior face of cecum was excised. The postoperative period was uneventful. The air-contrast barium enema (ACBE) in the postoperative period showed diverticuli along the whole colon being predominantly in the ascend-ing colon (Figure 1，2). The 4-year follow up of our patient aroused no tumor.\n\n【29】The macroscopic examination of the specimen showed the long radius was 3cm， appearance was irregular， and consisted of blood vessels and partly a lumen. In the microscopic examination regular gland was seen in mucosal tissue and inflammatory cells in the wall of diverticulae. The wall of diverticulae has whole layers of cecum (mucosae， muscularis mucosae， muscularis propria) so this was a true cecal diverticula.\n\n【30】Cecal diverticulitis is a rare entity that presents the surgeons with a diagnostic dilemma， which resembles acute appendicitis with fever， leukocytosis and right lower abdominal pain. As a result， the correct preope-rative diagnosis is rarely made and the surgeon is often confronted with this condition at the time of laparotomy \\[3\\]. The mentioned case was misdiagnosed and underwent an operation for acute appendicitis upon his first admission 8 years ago. The diagnosis of cecal diverticulitis was overlooked and not searched for postoperatively. The anamnesis and the clinical findings may suggest an alternative diagnosis like right sided diverticulitis； former pain attacks in the right iliac fossae are frequent in these patients and might be diagnosed as diffuse diverticulosis before. Frequently there is abdominal tenderness overlying McBurney's point \\[4，5\\]； although it is in such acute appendicitis， a palpable mass in the right iliac fossae should be a warning sign 1\\[22，66\\]1. Laaparotomy for another diagnosis， such as retained foreign body has been performed before the second operation considering an attack of diverticulitis， without performing abdominal CT USG， and CT colonography.\n\n【31】Most patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis re-spond to conservative therapies such as antibiotic regimens and diet \\[3，7\\]. Most authors suggest that conservative antibiotic therapy will be successful in uncomplicated right colon diverticula if preoperative diagnosis is established \\[3，8，9\\]. Under emergency conditions， only USG could be performed for prompt diagnosis in our hospital， however the lesion could not be correctly identified with USG. The right co-lon diverticula are generally a true diverticula being congenital， solitary and comprising the whole layers of the colon， although they are most frequently pseudo-diverticula without a muscle layer \\[3，10\\]. Cecal diverticula are not always solitary. In three crowded series solitary diverticula were found to be81%，31%\\[8\\] and 80% \\[11\\] of the total cecal diver-ticula. In our case the patient who underwent an operation for solitary cecal diverticulitis was found to have multiple colonic diverticula in postoperative barium enema colonography.\n\n【32】However， the surgical treatment of cecal diverticula confronted during laparotomy is controversial. In Asian countries where the majority of patients are located， performing prophylactic appendectomy， leaving the non-perforated diverticulitis in situ and antibiotic administration afterwards， are popular with less complications and lower relapse rate \\[7\\] while resection of all gross diseases are popular in USA \\[4，11-14\\]. Ileocecectomy and right colectomy\n\n【33】in patients with right-sided diverticulitis are the most common operations performed \\[4-6\\]. However， au-thors of a study in Hong Kong have declared that they resect the whole segments with the disorder in patients with diverticulitis and perform primary ileo-colonic anastomosis. Resection and anastomosis are not harmful procedures since generalized peritonitis and severe peritoneal contamination are absent in the majority of patients. A lesser operation， such as diverticulectomy and invagination of the diverticulum， can be performed only in patients with less degree of inflammation， when the diverticulum can be easily defined \\[10，11\\]. Violi and his colleagues have chosen conservative therapy (diverticulectomy， inversion or no intervention) in patients who had appendectomy， mild diverticulitis without appendectomy history or limited findings of peritonitis with projected diver-ticulitis perforation \\[2\\]. Further studies are required to identify the optimum therapy for right-sided di-verticulitis according to the authors \\[2，10\\]. Violi and his colleagues suggest that intra-operative diagnosis in patients with probable right diverticulitis should be made by histological examination of the specimen and recommended not to rely on frozen section \\[2\\]. The histologic examination demonstrated the inflam-mation of a true diverticulum involving all layers which is relatively a rare condition. True congenital diverticula of the large bowel have been reported incidence of 1% to 2 % of the population \\[15\\]. The microscopic view of the diverticulum was insignificant in demonstrating the diverticulum since the specimen consisted of only the diverticulum without adjacent healthy cecum. There was only the diverticula but not normal adjacent cecum wall in the microscopic sec-tions of the cecal diverticula in our case. However， 2specimens obtained by diverticulectomy involved the adjacent tissue and demonstrated the pathological condition in a series while muscularis propria could not be demonstrated in one of the 13 other specimens in the same series 21.\n\n【34】The most conservative approach (diverticulectomy， inversion of the diverticulum) was used in the patients who underwent an appendicectomy. The risk of miss-ing an inflammatory carcinoma of the right colon is more valid in Oriental populations where benign pathology of the right colon is more common than neoplastic disease. In Griffith and co-worker's case with the intra-operative findings， the carcinoma could not be excluded； therefore the right hemicolectomy was performed 16\\].\n\n【35】Endoscopy can detect carcinoma，vascular insuf-ficiency， or inflammatory bowel disease. If a mass or fistula is present， it is not easy to diagnose and decide between diverticulitis and colon carcinoma.\n\n【36】A barium enema and colonoscopy may clarify the situation， but the final diagnosis may not be known until the pathologist examines the surgical speci-men \\[17\\].\n\n【37】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【38】The right colon diverticula diagnose with USG(Ultrasonography)， CT (Computed Tomography)， Helical CT (Helical Computed Tomography)， MRi\n\n【39】REFERENCES：\n\n【40】1\\.

Rectal prolapse af-fects all ages but is more common in children， women， and patients >50 years of age \\[2\\]. Some factors have been shown to be associated with the development of rectal prolapse， but the exact cause of rectal prolapse is unknown. Other risk fac-tors included chronic diarrhea in 15% of cases， constipation in30% to 67% of cases， history of previous surgery， cystic fibro-sis， chronic obstructive pulmonary disease， pertussis， multiple sclerosis， and paralysis. Rectal prolapse in women is often as-sociated with weakness of the pelvic floor muscles caused by repeated vaginal deliveries \\[3\\]. Rectal prolapse is also associ-ated with a spectrum of coexisting anatomic abnormalities， such as an abnormally deep cul-de-sac， redundant sigmoid co-lon， patulous anal sphincter， levator ani diastasis， and loss or attenuation of the rectal sacral attachments4.\n\n【28】Clinical manifestations of rectal prolapse include discomfort of prolapsing tissue both internally and externally， bloody or mucus discharge from the rectum， and fecal incontinence or constipation \\[4\\]. Rectal prolapse significantly affects an indi-vidual's quality of life \\[5\\]. Rectal prolapse can occur spontane-ously when the patient is standing or during the Valsalva ma-neuver during defecation or coughing. Other findings include edematous， ulcerated， and brittle mucosa of the herniated rec-tal segment. Most rectal prolapses can resolve spontaneous-ly or by manual reduction. In some cases， the prolapsed seg-ment cannot be reduced and becomes incarcerated， which can lead to complications including severe pain， bleeding， stran-gulation， and even perforation \\[2\\].\n\n【29】The current Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee of the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons advise indi-vidually tailored and prompt surgical treatment for all patients with rectal prolapse， including elderly patients， to avoid com-plications and risk of recurrence. There are certain challenges of surgical procedures in elderly patients， such as complica-tion rates， comorbidities， morbidity， mortality， and recurrence rates \\[4\\]. This report presents the case of a 54-year-old man with a large rectal prolapse treated with perineal proctosig-moidectomy with levatorplasty (Altemeier procedure). This case report was constructed in line with the SCARE 2020 criteria \\[6\\].\n\n【30】Case Report\n\n【31】A 54-year-old male patient (body mass index： 24.2 kg/m²) came to the surgical outpatient department with concerns of a large bulging in the rectum since 5 months ago. At first， the bulg-ing was small， but its size had increased until approximately10 cm at presentation. The patient also stated that the bulging\n\n【32】Figure 1. An irreducible， large rectal prolapse with mucosal ulceration， with an approximate length of 10 cm.\n\n【33】used to reduce spontaneously after defecating or manually by applying sufficient pressure， but lately it had been irreducible. Other concerns included chronic constipation over the last few years， which he treated with over-the-counter laxatives and stool softeners. The patient felt very uncomfortable， as he was not able to sit normally. He had a history of controlled hyper-tension and denied any family history of a similar disease， his-tory of surgery，and/or other diseases.\n\n【34】The patient's vital signs and general examination were within normal limits. Physical examination of the perianal region re-vealed a full-thickness， irreducible， prolapsed bowel segment， approximately 10 cm long， with multiple mucosal ulcerations(Figure 1). Grade Vrectal prolapse was diagnosed. Before the surgery， the patient underwent a colonoscopy， which had a normal result. Preoperative laboratory test results and imag-ing were unremarkable.\n\n【35】The planning for the patient was surgery as soon as possible， with the technique of choice being perineal proctosigmoidec-tomy with levatorplasty (Altemeier procedure). The patient’s ASA score was 2. He was administered prophylaxis antibiotic one hour before surgery， which was done by an experienced digestive surgeon at a general hospital.\n\n【36】The patient was positioned in lithotomy， under spinal anesthe-sia， with the prolapsed tissue fully exteriorized. First， marking of the resection line 1 to 2 cm proximal to the dentate line was done with an ultrasonic knife (Figure 2). Then， a circumferen-tial incision was made on the pre-marked line， including all lay-ers of the rectal wall (Figure 3). The peritoneum was opened， and then reduction and resection of the prolapsed rectal and part of sigmoid colon were done (Figure 4). The rectal blood\n\n【37】Figure 2. Marking of the resection line 1 to 2 cm proximal to the dentate line was done with an ultrasonic knife.\n\n【38】Figure 4. Resected prolapsed rectum and part of the sigmoid colon.\n\n【39】Figure 3. A circumferential incision on the pre-marked line， including all layers of the rectal wall.\n\n【40】Figure 5. The postoperative res ult.\n\n【41】vessels were ligated. Then， a subsequent posterior levatorplas-ty was performed. Finally， a coloanal anastomosis was done with placement of circumferential interrupted sutures place-ment using 3-0 absorbable sutures.\n\n【42】Discussion\n\n【43】Several factors might influence the choice of surgery in treat-ing rectal prolapse； the Altemeier procedure is one of the more beneficial surgical techniques.\n\n【44】The postoperative result showed successful results (Figure 5). The patient had complete resolution of symptoms and was dis-charged 7 days after the surgery with satisfactory quality of life. Follow-up was done 14 days after surgery， which showed good recovery and no recurrence. The pathological examina-tion of the resected segments revealed no abnormalities but local inflammation. During an outpatient follow-up visit at 1month after surgery， the patient did not experience any symp-toms， and was satisfied with the type of treatment he received.\n\n【45】Rectal prolapse is an external protrusion of the rectal muco-sa through the external anal sphincter \\[1\\]. It is classified in to3 clinical subtypes： mucosal invagination， incomplete (partial； internal)， and complete (full-thickness； external) \\[2\\]. Fecal in-continence， obstructed defecation， incomplete rectal evacua-tion， rectal pressure， and pain are some of the symptoms that can result from rectal prolapse \\[4\\].\n\n【46】Treatments such as lifestyle improvements and biofeedback from the pelvic floor can provide temporary relief of rectal pro-lapse symptoms. However， surgical management is the only definitive treatment that can improve quality of life and bowel function \\[4\\]. When a rectal prolapse is irreducible， whether there is necrosis or not， immediate surgical repair is required \\[8\\]. In this case， there was an irreducible， large rectal prolapse with a length of 10 cm and multiple lacerations. Therefore， the pa-tient required definitive treatment of surgery to prevent fur-ther complications caused by delay in surgery.\n\n【47】Preoperative evaluation includes a colonoscopy， which is re-quired in all patients because polyps， cancer， and colitis can be the underlying cause in some patients \\[1\\]. In this case， we performed a colonoscopy， which had a normal result.\n\n【48】A surgical procedure to correct rectal prolapse has 3 main goals：(1) to eliminate the prolapse through either resection or resto-ration of normal anatomy， (2) to correct associated functional abnormalities of constipation or incontinence， and (3) to avoid the creation of de novo bowel dysfunction \\[4\\]. Various surgi-cal techniques and procedures have been described in his-torical literature and can be classified into an abdominal ap-proach (ie， Wells， Ripstein， Orr-Loygue) and perineal approach(ie， Altemeier， Delorme) \\[4，8\\].\n\n【49】Several factors might influence the choice of surgery， including age， sex， incontinence， comorbidities， repair of the previous prolapse， physiological testing， the experience of the surgeon， and the presence of preoperative constipation \\[2\\].\n\n【50】The current Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee of the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons advise indi-vidually tailored and prompt surgical treatment for all patients with rectal prolapse， including elderly patients， to avoid com-plications and risk of recurrence. The Altemeier procedure con-sists of perineal rectosigmoidectomy， a transanal full-thickness resection of the prolapsed rectum， and a coloanal anastomo sis. This procedure has been associated with higher recurrence rates， but when combined with a levatorplasty， its recurrence rate is reduced to 7%\\[4，8\\].\n\n【51】A case series by Nguyen et al recommended that the Altemeier procedure should be strongly considered when the prolapse is irreducible， whether there is necrosis or not \\[8\\]. The Altemeier procedure is also preferred for cases of longer rectal pro-lapse \\[5\\]. The present case of an irreducible， large rectal pro-lapse was suitable for treatment with the Altemeier procedure.\n\n【52】The Altemeier procedure can be performed under spinal an-esthesia and does not cause laparotomy trauma， allowing for faster gastrointestinal recovery， mobility， and shorter hospi-tal stay \\[4\\]. In previous studies， morbidity ranges from 3% to\n\n【53】35%， with mortality rarely reported. Its complication rates is also lower compared to that of surgery with an abdominal ap-proach， which requires general anesthesia and can cause com-plications of pelvic adhesions， the risk of infertility in young women， and impotence in young men \\[9\\].\n\n【54】Complications of using total anesthesia in the abdominal ap-proach are why the perineal approach is chosen to treat rectal prolapse in elderly patients with comorbidities \\[10\\]. The American College of Surgeon's National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) divides rectal prolapse complications into ma-jor and minor complications. Major complications include or-gan space infections， thromboembolism， cardioembolism， de-pendence on ventilators， renal failure， and sepsis， while surgical site infections and urinary tract infections are minor compli-cations \\[9\\]. Anastomotic leakage (1.88%) was found to be the most common complication after the Altemeier procedure \\[11\\].\n\n【55】In a previous study， 153 major complications were reported in the 30-day postoperative period involving 94 patients (7.4%)， and 86 minor complications were reported in 85 (6.7%) pa-tients. A recent study reported a major complication rate of2.3%， with listed complications including aspiration pneumo-nia and lung failure \\[9\\]. Patients were treated according to the complications that occurred： 14 patients with minimal ana-tomic leakage were successfully treated conservatively， and4 patients with postoperative anemia required blood trans-fusion， resulting in no postoperative mortality at 30 days \\[9\\].\n\n【56】At a median interval of 49 months， 34 patients were assessed. Six patients were deceased for reasons not related to the pro-lapse and 3 were lost to follow-up. Rectal prolapse recurrence was found in 2 patients， who therefore underwent re-operation， with 1 redo-Altemeier procedure， and 1 Goldberg procedure \\[9\\].\n\n【57】The authors of studies of the Altemeier procedure have conclud-ed that it is still the main choice in elderly patients and patients with severe comorbidities， resulting in good results， and is as-sociated with low morbidity， mortality and recurrence \\[4，5，9\\]. The patient presented in this case report was an elderly person with an irreducible， large rectal prolapse. Therefore， the most appropriate surgical technique was the Altemeier procedure.\n\n【58】The patient reported no complications at follow-up 7，14，and30 days after surgery. The patient also reported complete reso-lution of symptoms and no recurrence， which significantly im-proved his quality of life.\n\n【59】Conclusions\n\n【60】which has good efficacy with low morbidity， complications， and recurrence， should be considered in elderly patients with an irreducible， large rectal prolapse.\n\n【61】References：\n\n【62】1\\.

We present here a unique case of gastroesophageal carcinoma with metastasis to the rectum.\n\n【19】Case Report： A 60-year-old female patient presented with constipation， bloating， and weight loss of 4-month duration. She had undergone sleeve gastrectomy 6 years before. Endoscopies performed revealed a friable-looking mucosa in the lower esophagus and a polypoid rectal mass. Histopathological examination from both the esophageal and rectal lesions revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma cells. Immunohistochemistry stain from both specimens was positive for CK7 supporting the gastric site primary with metastasis to the rectum. Further eval-uation also revealed metastasis to bone and malignant pleural effusion. Chemotherapy with palliative intent was initiated.\n\n【20】Conclusions： Colorectal metastasis is commonly seen from cancers of the breast， stomach，melanoma， kidney， prostate， and ovaries. However， colorectal metastasis from gastroesophageal cancer has never been reported in the medical literature. Diagnosis relies on histopathologic examination and immunohistochemical staining of the tumor. Treatment depends on the tumor stage. Tumors with widespread metastatic disease are candidates for palli-ative chemotherapy.\n\n【21】MeSH Keywords： Colorectal Neoplasms·Esophagogastric Junction · Neoplasm Metastasis\n\n【22】Full-text PDF http：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/898534\n\n【23】十十十 甘6\n\n【24】Gastroesophageal junction cancer has been classified by some researchers under as both gastric and esophageal carcinomas. However， gastroesophageal carcinoma is different from gas tric and esophageal cancers \\[1\\]. Incidence of gastroesophage-al carcinomas in the United States is increasing more rapid-ly than any other malignancy \\[2\\]. Colorectal metastasis from gastroesophageal cancer has never been reported. We report a case of rectal metastasis from gastroesophageal junction ad-enocarcinoma confirmed histologically in a 60-year-old wom-an presenting with constipation.\n\n【25】Case Report\n\n【26】A 60-year-old female patient presented to our hospital with complaints of worsening constipation， abdominal bloating， and about 20-pound-weight loss of 4-month duration. She denied dysphagia， abdominal pain， nausea， vomiting， heartburn， he-matemesis， or melena. She did not have any significant medi-cal problems in the past. She had undergone bariatric surgery(sleeve gastrectomy) 6 years ago in the Dominican Republic； the endoscopy findings prior to the surgery are not known. She had also undergone cesarean section and tubal ligation17 years ago. Her grandmother had uterine cancer. She de-nied tobacco， alcohol， or illicit drug use. On examination， the blood pressure was 120/70 mm Hg， the pulse was 96 beats per minute， the temperature 37.1℃， and the respiratory rate14 breaths per minute. There was dullness on percussion pos-teriorly at the right lung base with absent breath sounds on auscultation of the same area. The other results of the gener-al and systemic examination were unremarkable.\n\n【27】The serum level of alkaline phosphatase was elevated to 226U per liter (normal reference range， 43-160)， and the serum albumin was 2.8 gm per deciliter (normal reference range，3.2-4.6). Her carcinoembryonic antigen level (CEA) was 68.4ng/ml (normal reference range <5 ng/ml). The rest of the liver function test results were normal， as were the complete blood count， levels of electrolytes， glucose， calcium， and results of re-nal function tests and coagulation panel. X-ray chest revealed bilateral patchy opacities with right-sided pleural effusion.\n\n【28】Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed， which showed a single diverticulum in the distal esophagus， abnor-mal-looking friable and granular mucosa at the lower esopha-geal end， and evidence of prior sleeve gastrectomy (Figure 1). Histopathological examination of the lower esophageal ab-normal-looking mucosa and proximal gastric mucosal biop-sies showed foci of atypical cell infiltrate in the lamina pro-pria (Figure 2). Flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed a polypoid rectal mass (Figure 3). Lower endoscopic ultrasound confirmed\n\n【29】Figure 1.

Histopathological examination of rectal mass biopsy specimen showed poorly differentiated invasive signet ring cell adeno-carcinoma (Figure 4). On Immunohistochemistry (IHC) stain， the gastroesophageal tumor cells were positive for AE1/AE3， CK7， and CDX2， and focally positive for CK20 antibodies， con-sistent with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (Figure 5). IHC staining on the rectal mass biopsy specimen demonstrated positive staining for CK7， CK20，CDX2， and CEA， and was neg-ative for LCA antibodies (Figure 6). Cancer cells at the 2 sites(lower esophagus and rectum) were identical on cytomorpho-logic and immunohistologic examinations (CK7 immunoreac-tivity)， confirming gastroesophageal carcinoma as the prima-ry site with metastatic involvement of rectum.\n\n【35】Figure 6. Rectal mass. Immunohistochemical stain cytokeratin 7demonstrates strong positivity in the infiltrating signet ring cells (x400).\n\n【36】Metastatic work-up with head， chest， and abdomino-pelvic CT scan showed multifocal osteoblastic lesions of the left fron-tal bone and skull base， 2 pulmonary nodules， and numerous osteoblastic lesions in the thoracic spine. Bilateral malignant pleural effusion as confirmed by pleural fluid examination was also found.\n\n【37】The patient was treated with Docetaxel， Cisplatin， and5-Fluorouracil with Leucovorin for 10 cycles over a period of8 months， during which she had improvement in her appetite and overall well-being. Her CEA levels diminished to 10.6 ng/ml. Twelve months after her diagnosis of metastatic gastro-esophageal cancer， she was admitted with complicated para-pneumonic pleural effusion and developed acute respiratory failure. She declined endotracheal intubation and resuscitation and died due to complicated parapneumonic effusion， sepsis， and respiratory failure.\n\n【38】Discussion\n\n【39】In the last 3 decades， the incidence and prevalence of gastro-esophageal junction carcinomas has dramatically increased in Western countries， while it is decreasing in Eastern coun-tries \\[1，3\\]. In the United States， the incidence of gastroesoph-ageal junction cancer was 1.22 per 100 000 population in1973-1978 and it increased to 1.94 in 2003-2008 \\[4\\]. The in-cidence of gastroesophageal junction carcinomas is about 4.7times higher in men as compared to women. Among men， white men have a 1.88 times higher risk than black men.\n\n【40】Risk factors for gastroesophageal junction cancers include smoking， obesity， and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Our patient was obese and had undergone sleeve gastrectomy， which may increase GERD \\[5\\]. On the other hand， a decline in\n\n【41】obesity-related cancers has been seen after bariatric surgery. A meta-analysis by Yang et al. in 2011 showed decreased in-cidence of obesity-related cancers in patients who have un-dergone bariatric surgery. However， effects of bariatric surgery on gastric， esophageal， or gastroesophageal cancers were not reviewed in this meta-analysis \\[6\\]. Infection with Helicobacter pylori and high dietary fiber intake has been found to be pro-tective and linked to lower disease risk.\n\n【42】Early-stage gastroesophageal cancers are usually asymptomatic. Symptoms of advanced gastroesophageal junction result from a mass causing difficult transit of the food bolus. Dysphagia is a common symptom. Weight loss， which was one of the pre-senting complaints in our patient， is mostly due to interference with dietary habits. However， in advanced cancers， weight loss is the result of toxicity from the tumor.\n\n【43】In 1996， Siewert et al. classified adenocarcinoma of the gas-troesophageal junction based upon anatomic topography \\[7\\]. Recently， all the tumors that arise within 5 cm proximal and distal to the anatomic cardia are considered as adenocarci-noma of the gastroesophageal junction， and it has now been sub-divided into： a) Type l， which arise from an area of intesti-nal metaplasia in the distal esophagus and invade the gastro-esophageal junction from above； b) Type ll， which arise from the gastric cardiac epithelium or metaplastic junctional epi-thelium； and c) Type Ill， which are cancers that originate from the subcardial region and invade the gastroesophageal junc-tion from below \\[1\\]. Type l tumors are less frequent in Eastern countries than in Western countries. The difference may be due to lower prevalence of obese patients with GERD in Eastern countries compared to Western countries \\[3\\].\n\n【44】Surgery is the mainstay oftreatment in patients who have no evidence of distant metastasis and are fit for surgery. Extended transthoracic surgery is recommended only for type Itumors. A transhiatal extended gastrectomy is the preferred approach for type Il and type Ill tumors \\[3\\]. Perioperative chemothera-py contributes to survival when combined with a limited nod-al dissection \\[8\\]. A Germany study showed that patients who received preoperative chemoradiation had a higher 3-year survival rate compared to those who received preoperative chemotherapy alone， although the difference did not reach statistical significance \\[9\\]. Prognosis is better when periop-erative chemoradiation is combined with limited nodal dis-section； however， when combined with extensive nodal dis-section， the prognosis remains unknown. Patients who have advanced disease with systemic metastases are recommend-ed to receive systemic chemotherapy， which is usually a com-bination of Fluorouracil and Cisplatin. If the gastroesophage-al tumors are HER-2 positive， Fluoropyrimidine， Cisplatin，and Trastuzumab could be a standard chemotherapy.\n\n【45】Gastric tumors have been divided into intestinal and diffuse types according to Lauren classification. The intestinal type ex-hibit cell adhesion and form glands， are associated with intes-tinal metaplasia， and are known to cause lymphatic and vascu-lar invasion. The diffuse type lacks adhesion， forms signet ring cells， and are associated with peritoneal metastasis \\[10\\].Our patient did have signet cell formation in the histopathology， but CT abdomen failed to reveal any peritoneal metastasis. In general， there are 5 main routes of metastasis of esophageal and gastric cancer： 1) direct invasion 2) lymphatic spread 3) hematogenous 4) transperitoneal， and 5) intraluminal implan-tation \\[11\\]. Gastroesophageal junction cancers usually cause liver and peritoneal metastases. Colorectal metastasis from any cancer is very uncommon. Colorectal metastasis is usual-ly from cancers of the breast， stomach， skin (melanomas)， kid-ney， prostate， or ovaries \\[12\\]. There have been case reports of gastric or gastric stump carcinoma metastasizing to the colon and presenting as solitary or multiple colonic polyps \\[12-14\\]. However， there have been no reported cases of gastroesoph-ageal junction tumors metastasizing to the rectum. The most plausible explanation for the spread of gastroesophageal can-cer to the rectum is lymphatic spread， as has been proposed widely in cases of Krukenberg tumor \\[15\\]， and integrins ex-pressed on exosomes of tumor cells contribute to organ-spe-cific metastasis \\[16\\].\n\n【46】We presented a rare case of gastroesophageal junction can-cer with metastasis to the rectum. When multiple lesions are found in a patient， it is of prime importance to identify the primary lesion and differentiate the synchronous lesions from metastatic lesions to define the further treatment plan. Interestingly， tumor marker CEA， well known to be associated with colorectal cancers， can also be elevated in other malig-nancies \\[17，18\\]and hence cannot differentiate between these entities. A study by Terada on cytokeratin profile based on im-munohistochemical stain has demonstrated that gastric sig net cell carcinoma is more likely to express CK7 and not CK20， whereas colon signet cell carcinoma express CK20 more often than CK7 \\[19\\]. In our case， tumor cells at the gastroesophage-al junction and rectum had positivity for CK7， supporting the primary gastric site.\n\n【47】Conclusions\n\n【48】Our case is the first report of adenocarcinoma of the gastro-esophageal junction with metastasis to the rectum. This case illustrates an unusual site of metastasis of a gastroesophageal cancer and heightens our awareness in suspecting an unusual primary site if such rectal lesions are found. It is of utmost im-portance to identify the primary tumor sites because manage-ment depends on knowing the primary site. Briefly， rectal can-cers at early-stage can be treated with surgical excision alone，\n\n【49】whereas at the advanced stage they need neoadjuvant che-motherapy followed by adjuvant chemoradiation. On the oth-er hand， treatment of early locoregional gastroesophageal can-cer involves neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgical excision. More advanced disease is treated with chemotherapy alone.\n\n【50】References：\n\n【51】1\\. Stein HJ， Feith M， Siewert M： Cancer of the esophagogastric junction. Surg Oncol， 2000； 9： 35-41\n\n【52】2\\.

The relationship between hyponatremia and cardiac conduction disorders has not been demonstrated yet. When there is a decrease in extracellular Na+ levels， there is a delay in the depolarization phase. This study was conducted to observe the ECG pattern in hyponatremic patients with heart failure (particularly in the P wave， PR interval， and QRS complex) and ECG changes after 24 hours of therapy. Method：This study used a longitudinal observational descriptive method. Patients included in this study were hyponatremic patientswith heart failure at the Wahidin Sudirohusodo Hospital Makassar from April to September 2021. Thepatient’s electrocardiogram data when first admitted and after 24 hours of therapy. Statistical test usingMcNemar and Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test， where the test results are statistically significant when thep-value <0.05. Result： This study included51 subjects with a distribution of 68.6% men aged 18-85 years. Pre-therapy ECG pattern showed 12 patients with prolonged P-R interval and 4patients with the widening of the QRS complex. After 24 hours of therapy， 12 people became normonatremia， and the mean P wave and P-R interval were lower than pre-therapy， while the QRS complex showed no changes. Conclusion： The ECG pattern in hyponatremia with heart failure is a prolonged P-R interval and widening of the QRS complex， but the ECG changes were insignificant to Na+ levels changes.\n\n【5】KEYWORDS Hyponatremia， Heart Failure， Electrocardiogram， Sodium\n\n【6】Background\n\n【7】Electrolyte disturbances can precipitate an arrhythmia， even in patients without structural heart defects.1 Changes in extracel-lular electrolyte levels can alter myocytes' membrane potential and the heart's action potential. Myocyte depolarization and repolarization depend on intra- and extracellular ion shifts so ab-normal electrolytes can affect cardiac conduction. These changes will result in changes in the electrocardiogram (ECG) picture and can trigger arrhythmias.-\n\n【8】Hyponatremia，i.e. sodium (Na+) <135 mmol/L， is the most common electrolyte disturbance in hospitalized heart failure patients， with a prevalence of around 19%-25%. Data from Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospital-ized Patients with Heart Failure (OPTIMIZE-HF)showed that\n\n【9】Copyright @ 2023 by the Bulgarian Association of Young Surgeons\n\n【10】DO： 10.5455/JMRCR.172-1671075092First Received： December 16，2022Accepted： January 4， 2023Associate Editor： Ivan Inkov (BG)；\n\n【11】Achmad Fausan Adiatma Umar， MD， Department of Internal Medicine， Faculty of\n\n【12】Medicine， Hasanuddin University， Makassar 90245， Indonesia.

(2002)5 reported that hyponatremia was the most common electrolyte disturbance in patients with conges-tive heart failure， with a 33.7% presentation in the study group. However， managing hyponatremia， especially in patients with acute heart failure， is still challenging. A study by Miller et al.(2016) reported that untreated hyponatremia occurred in 43.6%of patients.\n\n【15】The relationship between hyponatremia and cardiac conduc-tion disorders has not been fully elucidated. An empirical study by Trautwein et al. reported that very low Natlevels in cardiac muscle could reduce the number of contractions as well as ex-citability and conduction rates. The study by Nikolaido et al.(2015) reported that low Natlevels could affect action potentials at the AV node. It wasalso found that decreased extracellular Na+ levels decreased Na+ to flow into the heart.\n\n【16】In the depolarization phase， extracellular Na+ will rapidly enter the cell through Nat channels， so if there is a decrease in extracellular Na+ levels， there will be a slowdown in the depolarizationphase. This slowing of the depolarization phase can occur in the intra-atrial， depolarizing pathways from the SA node to the ventricles or throughout the ventricular muscle.910\n\n【17】An electrocardiogram (ECG) is an examination that can assess the electrical activity of the heart， so it can be used to monitor and detect abnormalities in the cardiac conduction system. Deceleration of intra-atrial depolarization can cause left atrial enlargement， thus providing an overview of the widening of the P wave. Moreover， SA to the ventricle will give a picture of a pro longed PR interval. In contrast， prolonged depolarization time in all ventricular muscles will show the widening of the QRS complex. So this study was conducted to obtain an ECG picture in hyponatremicpatients with heart failure (especially in the P wave， PR interval， and QRS complex) and ECG changesafter24 hours of therapy being treated at Wahidin Sudirohusodo Hospital Makassar.\n\n【18】Research Method\n\n【19】Research Design\n\n【20】An observational study with longitudinal study method.\n\n【21】Time and Location\n\n【22】The study was conducted at the Wahidin Sudirohusodo Hospital， Makassar， from April 2020until September 2021.\n\n【23】Sample and Collection\n\n【24】All inpatients at Dr Hospital. Wahidin Sudirohusodo in Makas-sar was diagnosed withhyponatremia with heart failure. The inclusion criteria were age > 18， diagnosed with hyponatremia with heart failure. All subjects signed an informed consent form.\n\n【25】Data Analysis\n\n【26】Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 25. The analyti-cal method consisted of descriptive methods and statistical tests. The statistical method used is the calculation of the mean value and standard deviation (SD) as well as the frequency distribu-tion. The statistical test used is McNemar and Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. Statistical test results are considered significant if the testedp-value <0.05.\n\n【27】Research Ethics\n\n【28】Ethical clearance approved by Ethics Committee for Biomedical Research on Human， Faculty of Medicine， Hasanuddin Univer-sity， Makassar. Following the ethical recommendations with approval letter number 300/UN4.6.6.5.31/PP36/2021.\n\n【29】Study Result\n\n【30】Sample overview\n\n【31】The study was conducted on 51 subjects (35 men and 16 women) aged 19-71. Subjects who had a history of smoking were 16 peo-ple (31.4%). Most of the subjects had 1-2 comorbidities (51.0%)， with the most common causes of heart failure being ischemic heart disease (37.3%) and valvular heart disease (37.3%). Based on the NYHA Class of heart failure， most subjects with NYHA Class III consist of 34 people (66.7%) and NYHA Class IV(27.5%). Based on the ejection fraction， most subjects with HFrEF consist of 37 people (72.5%). Subjectswho received therapy fluid restric-tion， diuretics， and HSS infusion consisted of 13 people(25.5%). Therewere 12 (23.5) subjects gave pre-therapy ECG images in the form of prolonged P-R intervals and 4 (7.8%) subjects with the widening of the QRS complex. (table 1)\n\n【32】Changes of Na+ Levels post Therapy\n\n【33】Table 2 shows that after treatment， the changes in Na+ level of 12 (23.5%)subjects from 51 subjects became normonatremia， and 39 subjects (76.5%) remained hyponatremic. Ⅲ.3. ECG Pattern Pre and Post Therapy Of 51 subjects in this study， 12(23.5%) experienced P-R interval lengthening preand post-ther-apy. Widening of the QRS complex was found in 4 subjects (7.8%) pre-therapy and 2subjects (3.9%) post-therapy. None of the sub-jects experienced a widening of the P wave. (Table 3) Inthis study， the average P wave post-therapy was smaller than the P wave average pre-therapy， which was 0.0617 seconds compared to 0.0633 seconds， but it was not statistically significant. In the P-R intervalpost- therapy， the average P-R interval was 0.1711seconds compared to 0.1706 seconds， but statistically the change was insignificant (p>0.05). The average QRS wave post-therapy was found smaller than the average QRS complex pre-therapy， Py：which was 0.0733 seconds compared to 0.073 seconds. From the statistical calculation， the QRS complex change was also insignificant (p>0.05). (table 4)\n\n【34】Comparison of ECG Images of Post-Therapeutic Normona-tremic Patients with Pre-Treatment\n\n【35】Of the 12 subjects who changed to normonatremia in post-therapy， 5 of them experienced an ECG pattern of AF， so the P waves and P-R interval could only be assessed in 7 subjects. In subjects with Natlevels who became normonatremia post-therapy， the mean of P wave post-therapy was smaller than pre-therapy， which is 0.057 seconds compared to 0.060 seconds， but statistically not significant (p>0.05). The mean decrease was also found in the P-R interval post-therapy， which is 0.165 sec-onds compared to 0.171 seconds， while in the QRS complex， there was no change in the meanbetween post-therapy and pre-therapy， the change was also not statistically significant (p>0.05).(table 5)\n\n【36】Discussion\n\n【37】Analysis of the Comparison of ECG Pattern Pre and Post Ther-apy\n\n【38】Action potentials from the heart occur through the processes of depolarization and repolarization. In the depolarization phase， the Na+ channel opens so that extracellular Na+ can enter the cell. When the extracellular Na+ level decreases， there is a slowdown in the depolarization phase.\n\n【39】The P wave on the EKG represents the depolarization of the atria. A slowing of conduction between the left and right atrium can cause abnormalities of the atria， which can give a picture of the widening of the P wave. statistically meaningless. This could be because only a small proportion of the study subjects with changes in Nat levels became normal after therapy.\n\n【40】A slowing of depolarization originating from the SA node to the ventricles can result in a lengthening of the P-R interval.19 In this study， it was seen that in hyponatremia， the average P-R interval was 0.1711 seconds，but after treatment， the average P-R interval increased. This could bedue to the small number of samples and other conditions that can also affect the P-R interval， such as heart failure conditions that can affect the remodelling of the heart， as well as drugs that can affect the duration of the P-R interval.\n\n【41】The additional time required by all ventricular muscle to depolarize causes the QRS complex to widen.19 In this study， it was seen that the average post-therapy QRS wave improved\n\n【42】Table 1 Characteristic Subject in Heart Failure Patients with Hyponatremia Level.\n\n| Variable  |  | 1  | %  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sex  | Man  | 35  | 68，6  |\n| Sex  | Woman  | 16  | 31，4  |\n| Age  | <=60 tahun  | 33  | 64，7  |\n| Age  | \\>60 takun  | 18  | 35，3  |\n| Comorbid  | No  | 24  | 47，1  |\n| Comorbid  | 1-2  | 26  | 51，0  |\n| Comorbid  | \\>2  | 1  | 2，0  |\n| History of smoking  |  | 35  | 68，6  |\n| History of smoking  | yes  | 16  | 31，4  |\n| NYHA Class  |  | 3  | 5，9  |\n| NYHA Class  | III  | 34  | 66，7  |\n| NYHA Class  | IV  | 14  | 2/.5  |\n| Etiology of HF  | Ischemic Heard Disease  | 19  | 37.3  |\n| Etiology of HF  | HHD  | I0  | 19，6  |\n| Etiology of HF  | Valoular heart Disease  | 19  | 37.3  |\n| Etiology of HF  | Others  | 3  | 5，9  |\n| Ejection Fraction  | HFpEF  | II  | 21，6  |\n| Ejection Fraction  | HFmrEF  | 3  | 5，9  |\n| Ejection Fraction  | HFrEF  | 37  | 72，5  |\n| Therapy  | Fluid restriction + diuretic  | 38  | 74，5  |\n| Therapy  | Fluid restriction + diuretic + Hypertonic Saline  | 13  | 25，5  |\n| ECG Pattern Pre Therapy  | P wave widening  | 0  | 0，0  |\n| ECG Pattern Pre Therapy  | P-R interual lengthening  | 12  | 23，5  |\n| ECG Pattern Pre Therapy  | QRS complex widening  | 4  | 7，8  |\n\n【44】Table 2 Na+ Level Changes Post Therapy.\n\n| Na+ Post Terapi  |  | 1  | %  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Na+ Changes  | Normonatremia  | 12  | 23，5  |\n| Na+ Changes  | Hyponatremia  | 39  | 76，5  |\n|  | Total  | 51  | 100  |\n\n【46】Table 3 ECG Patterna Pre and Post Therapy.\n\n| Variabel  | Pre Thearpy  | Post Therapy  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Variabel  | n(%)  | n(%)  |\n| P wave widening  | 0(0，0)  | 0(0，0)  |\n| P-R interual lengthening  | 12(23，5)  | 12(23，.5)  |\n| QRS complex widening  | 4(7，8)  | 2(3，9)  |\n\n【48】Table 4 Comparison Between Pre and Post Therapy ECG Pattern.\n\n| Variable  | Pre therapy  | Post theraoy  | P  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Variable  | Mean (SD)  | Mean (SD)  | P  |\n| P wave (s)  | 0，0633 (0，0130)  | 0，0617 (0，0129)  | 0，183  |\n| P-R interual (s)  | 0，1706 (0，0276)  | 0，1711 (0，0263)  | 0，872  |\n| QRS compelx (s)  | 0，0737 (0，0281)  | 0，0733 (0，0248)  | 0，821  |\n\n| ECG Pattern  |  |  | Min  | Maks  | Megn  | SD  | P  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Pwaue (s)  | Pre therapy Post therapy  | 7  | 0.04 0.04  | 0，08 0.08  | 0，060 0，057  | 0，016 0.013  | 0，317  |\n| P-R interoal (s)  | Pre therapy Post therapy  | 7  | 0.12 0.12  | 0.20 0.20  | 0，171 0.165  | 0，030 0，027  | 0，317  |\n| QRS complex (s)  | Pre therapy Post therapy  | 12  | 0.04 0.06  | 0.20 0.16  | 0，085 0，085  | 0.0430，036  | 1，000  |\n\n【51】comparedto pre- therapy， from 0.0737 seconds to 0.0733 seconds. However， the time was short of performing the evaluation may make the change insignificant.\n\n【52】Comparison of the ECG Changes in Normonatremia Patients\n\n【53】Post Therapy\n\n【54】Of 51 subjects， 12 (23.5%) became normonatremia post-therapy. Of these， 5 subjects had an AF rhythm in the ECG pattern， so only 7 subjects could be evaluated on the P wave and P-R inter-val. However， from the 7 subjects， it can be seen that the average P wave in post-therapy normonatremic conditions improved， namely 0.057 seconds compared to 0.060 in hyponatremic condi-tions.\n\n【55】In 7 subjects with normonatremia post-therapy， the mean P-R interval was improved， which was 0.165 seconds compared to pre-therapy (0.171 seconds). As explained before that Na+levels can affect depolarization in the SA node to the ventricles， which is characterized by the P-R interval， where the SA node is the most dominant pacemaker in the heart， so the effect of Na+will be seen in theP-R interval. In this study， the P-R interval changes were not significant. Several other factors can affect the P-R interval. A study by Nikolaidou et al. (2016)reported that 21% of patients with HFrEFhad a prolonged P-R interval. So it is difficult to know the condition of the lengthening of the P-Rinterval is influenced by Na+ levels or heart failure， which is the subject of this study. In 12 subjects who became normona-tremic post-therapy， there was no change in the QRS complex.\n\n【56】Figure 1 Correlation between AIRI and Syntax Score. The graphic shows that although the AIRI value changes， the Syn-tax score trend does not change.\n\n【57】Several studies have assessed factors other than electrolyte disturbances that can affect the ECG picture. Research by Tan et al. (2016)34 reported that gender， age， and BMI significantly affected theP-R interval's lengthening and the QRS complex's widening. Research by Ilkhanof et al. (2012)3 reported that race， male gender， and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) were significantly associated with QRS complex lengthening. Drugs such as antiarrhythmics can also affect the widening of the QRS complex.\n\n【58】Many confounding factors influence the ECG pattern， so our study's results did not show a significant relationship bet ween changes in Na+ levels and the ECG pattern. However， these factors were unfortunately not evaluated in this study and may have a major role in the ECG changes in the study subjects\n\n【59】Summary\n\n【60】Conclusion\n\n【61】The ECG pattern in hyponatremia with heart failure is a pro-longed P-R interval and widening of the QRS complex， but the ECG changes were insignificant to Nat level changes.\n\n【62】Suggestion for further research\n\n【63】It is necessary to conduct further research on the effect of hy-ponatremia on the ECG pattern in the population without heart disease.\n\n【64】References\n\n【65】1\\.

Bilateral dislocations of the facet joint require prompt evaluation， reduction， and surgical intervention. Rare case reports present bilateral dislocations presenting in a delayed fashion.\n\n【19】Case Report： We report the case of a 60-year-old male who presented with mild neck pain 1 year after initial injury. Computed topography of the cervical spine showed healing with bony fusion of a bilateral C6-7 facet dislocation. Given the chronic healed nature of the injury and minimal symptoms， the patient is being followed without intervention.\n\n【20】Conclusions：\n\n【21】Although most bilateral facet dislocations present and are treated immediately after injury； this case illustrates that some may be missed during initial evaluation. Once healed， these injuries may be stable without surgical intervention.\n\n【22】MeSH Keywords： Fracture Healing· Neck Injuries · Spinal Fractures\n\n【23】Full-text PDF http：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/892173\n\n【24】口\n\n【25】H品1047 山3\n\n【26】Bilateral facet dislocations of the cervical spine can be devas-tating cervical injuries that typically present at time of inju-ry \\[1\\]. This dislocation is an unstable injury and patients can present with severe neurologic deficits \\[2，3\\]. Without prompt treatment， neurologic deterioration is a major risk \\[3\\]. The ma jority of patients undergo closed reduction with traction \\[3，4\\]. After reduction patients often require surgical stabilization \\[5\\]. When surgical intervention is not an option， conservative mea-sures often include prolonged traction or halo vest placement. Conservative interventions may have satisfactory results， but delayed surgery may be required if conservative therapies fail\\[1J. As this injury often causes severe neck pain along with neurologic deficits， late presentations are uncommon. Missed\n\n【27】diagnosis occurs in patients with multiple traumatic injuries， those with incomplete adequate radiographic studies， or， least commonly， patients who are asymptomatic at time of injury\\[6\\]. Rare reports present patients with bilateral facet disloca-tion without neurologic deficit weeks to months after initial injury \\[7-11J. Typically， these late presenting patients are dis-covered due to severe neck pain with radicular symptoms after an injury. Surgical intervention is indicated in these patients due to the severity of symptoms and lack of fusion \\[8，9，11\\]. Even with spontaneous fusion， patients may be symptomat-ic from deformity or stenosis of the neuroformina， requiring surgery \\[10\\]. Our case illustrates that not providing treatment may be an option for very late-presenting patients with mini-mal symptoms and radiographic evidence of fusion.\n\n【28】Figure 1.

T2 sagittal MRI showing chronic dislocation of C6-7without signal changes within the spinal cord.\n\n【30】Case Report\n\n【31】A 60-year-old male with neck pain and no significant past med-ical history was admitted to the hospital for treatment of de-pression. He had a significant bicycle accident 1 year prior in\n\n【32】which he developed sudden-onset severe neck pain. At that time， he was evaluated at a community emergency depart-ment， where cervical x-rays were performed and reported as normal. He was released with pain medications and no cervi-cal collar. The patient described his neck pain then as severe and constant， requiring him to be on bed rest at home. The pain gradually diminished over time to a dull ache. He also noted intermittent numbness in his right first and second digit over the last year. He felt less coordinated than usual but still able to walk normally， ride his bicycle， and continue his active lifestyle. Two weeks prior to his admission， he had a minor bicycle accident that worsened his chronic neck pain. He did not notice any new neurologic symptoms. He described the pain as a stiffness that improved with oral pain medications.\n\n【33】His primary service ordered a computed topography (CT) scan of his neck to further evaluate his pain given his history of a bicycle accident. Physical exam showed no deficits. The CT re-vealed a bilateral facet dislocation of C6 on C7 with evidence of bony fusion suggesting a chronic nature (Figure 1). MRI was performed， which showed no spinal cord injury (Figure 2). Flexion and extension x-rays of the cervical spine were sta-ble (Figure 3). Surgical intervention was discussed， including a3-stage posterior-anterior-posterior surgical approach. In the first stage， we would release the posterior healed facet joints and fusion mass and perform a laminectomy for decompres-sion and then we would proceed to the second stage to re-lease the anterior fusion mass， reduce the dislocation， and\n\n【34】Figure 3. Lateral cervical spine x-rays with (A) extension view， (B) flexion view was obtained and showed stability of the dislocation.\n\n| First author，  | Number of  | Time from injury  | Symptoms  | Treatment  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| year of publication  | patients  | to presentation  | Symptoms  |  |\n| Thompson， 1978\\*  | 1  | 10 days  | Mild neck pain  | None， healed spontaneo usly  |\n| Bartels， 2002  | 3  | 10 weeks to 8  | Pain， hyperreflexia， weakness，  | Surgical fixation in all patients.

Case series that included unilateral injuries or previous attempts at conservative treatment are excluded.\n\n【37】perform an anterior fusion. The final stage would be fusion of the posterior elements. After discussing risks and benefits of surgery with the patient， he elected to continue with con-servative management of his neck pain because he felt that with minimal symptoms the risks of surgery outweighed the benefits. At 9-month follow-up he continued to do well with-out intervention.\n\n【38】Discussion\n\n【39】Patients with bilateral facet dislocations that remain without diagnosis and treatment are rare in the literature. We present here a patient with spontaneous fusion after bilateral cervi-cal facet dislocation 1 year prior， having his diagnosis missed and receiving no treatment for his injury. In 1978， Thompson and Hohl presented a case of a 72-year-old male with alco-holism who had a healed bilateral C5/6 dislocation that pre-sented 10 days after injury \\[7\\]. Since then， scattered case re-ports of undiagnosed bilateral facet dislocations that present several weeks or more after initial injury have been published(Table 1). Surgical intervention was indicated in these cases due to symptoms related to the injury \\[8-10\\]. Hassan et al. re-ported patients whose surgery was delayed up to a year， but the injury had been previously recognized and attempts at conservative therapies had failed \\[12\\].\n\n【40】Late presentations of bilateral cervical facet dislocations are challenging to treat. One of the difficulties in treating this entity is the inability to reduce the dislocation at more than 72 hours\n\n【41】after the injury \\[4\\]. One case series reviewed 19 patients with cervical facet dislocation whose presentation was delayed from7 to 21 days after injury； 5 of these patients had bilateral dis-locations. Closed reduction was attempted first on all patients， followed by surgical intervention. Of the 5 patients with bilater-al dislocations， 4 required anterior-posterior repair after closed reduction failed \\[14\\]. One author suggests a posterior-anterior-posterior approach based on their institution's experience. In their series of 3 patients， no attempt at closed reduction was made because the patients presented at several days， 10 weeks， and 8 months after injury. In 2 of the 3 patients， the anterior-posterior-anterior approach failed to achieve adequate reduc-tion， requiring the patients to have a fourth procedure from a posterior approach. With the third patient， the posterior-ante-rior-posterior approach was used with success \\[15\\]. In the case reports and series that included chronic bilateral facet disloca-tion， surgery was necessary because the patients continued to have severe symptoms from the injury. Unlike chronic bilater-al facet dislocations， chronic unilateral facet dislocations have been followed with no intervention and without neurologic def-icits on follow-up \\[16\\]. A study of long-term outcomes compar-ing patients treated conservatively with those treated surgical-ly would aid in managing this complex situation， but would be difficult given the rarity of this presentation.\n\n【42】Conclusions\n\n【43】The case presented indicates that the diagnosis of bilateral fac-et dislocations may be missed initially， then remain untreated\n\n【44】in patients who have no or minimal symptoms. In certain pa-tients， spontaneous fusion can occur. In patients presenting with chronic healed dislocations and who are neurological-ly intact with minimal or no symptoms， surgical intervention may not be necessary.\n\n【45】References：\n\n【46】1\\.

Their etiology might include immunologic abnormali-ties， fibrogenetic disorders， specific reactions to infections or abnormalities related to trauma， necrosis， or neo-plasm. Life-threatening ventricular tachycardia and cases of sudden death related to cardiac tumors have been reported. The present report describes and discusses diagnostic and therapeutic solutions for the treatment of nonsarcoid multiorgan pseudotumors with cardiac involvement.\n\n【21】Case Report： A 38-year-old woman presented to the clinic with symptomatic ventricu lar tachycardia. As coronary artery dis-ease， cardiomyopathy， and channelopathy were ruled out， and electrocardiograms were not typical of idiopathic arrhythmia， the patient underwent detailed diagnostics which included targeted endomyocardial biopsy，which revealed a cardiac inflammatory pseudotumor. Laborious testing (and eventually， antibiotic therapy) led to ex juvantibus diagnosis of multiorgan disseminated brucellosis with cardiac involvement. Treatment with ceftriax-one， doxycycline， and rifampicin resulted in a complete resolution of all lesions after 3 months， and sustained recovery was observed during a 5-year follow-up. As the risk of ventricular tachycardia could not be reliably\n\n【22】predicted， the patient had a subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implanted.\n\n【23】Conclusions： A vast diagnostic armamentarium of modern medicine allowed us to diagnose an unsuspected and rare cardi-ac inflammatory pseudotumor. In the case of travelers， the possibility of regionally specific illnesses， especial-ly infections， must be taken into consideration as possible causes of arrhythmias. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging may be useful in patients with idiopathic ventricular tachycardias' to detect non-apparent myocardi-al lesions which may result from the underlying cause of the arrhythmia.\n\n【24】Keywords： Brucellosis ·Case Reports · Tachycardia， Ventricular\n\n【25】Ful-text PDE https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/935259\n\n【26】目名111960 2 山g9 丰国1\n\n【27】The initial assessment of an episode of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) typically includes 12-lead ECG， transthorac-ic echocardiography， and functional testing and/or imaging for coronary artery abnormalities \\[1\\]. If structural or electrical heart disease is not excluded， a patient is deemed to have id-iopathic VT， and further treatment， either pharmacological or invasive， must be planned， with consideration for the patient's preference \\[2\\]. However， in rare cases， a thorough diagnostic process may lead to unsuspected findings. Infections should also be taken into consideration as possible causes of arrhyth-mias. Isolated cases of arrhythmia-triggering cardiac pseudotu-mors have been reported. Their etiology might include immu-nologic abnormalities， fibrogenetic disorders， specific reactions to infections， or abnormalities related to trauma， necrosis， or neoplasm. In the case of travelers， the possibility of contract-ing regionally specific illnesses， especially infections (includ-ing zoonoses)， must be taken into consideration as possible causes of arrhythmias.\n\n【28】A 38-year-old woman， with no previous medical history， pre-sented in our hospital with palpitations which had lasted a few hours and were associated with 2 episodes of presyncope. Ventricular tachycardia of approximately 180 bpm (Figure 1) was diagnosed and sinus rhythm was restored with direct-cur-rent cardioversion 200J (Schiller DEFIGARD 5000).\n\n【29】Ventricular tachycardia recurred after several days and required another cardioversion. Initial evaluation included basic labora-tory blood tests， the results of which were found to be normal， and transthoracic echocardiography that disclosed no abnor-mality. ECG revealed sinus bradycardia， lack of R-wave progres-sion V1-4， and non-specific repolarization abnormalities with QTc falling within the normal range (QTc=380 ms) (Figure 2). The patient presented adequate exercise tolerance， heart rate， and blood pressure reactions， with no ECG changes during the treadmill test. Coronary angiography disclosed no abnormal-ities. The patient denied having any history of ventricular ar-rythmia events， sudden cardiac deaths， or premature deaths\n\n【30】Figure 1.12-lead electrocardiogram during ventricular tachycardia. A clinical electrophysiologist noticed that the arrhythmia did not have the typical morphology for idiopathic left ventricular tachycardia (more precisely left posterior fascicular ventricular tachycardia) mainly due to inconsistent R-wave amplitude differences between adjacent leads (ie， amplitudes in leads：V1 -low， V2 - high， V3 -low， V4- residual， V5-high). Such a pattern might suggest scar-dependent ventricular tachycardia， but this requires confirmation.\n\n【31】Figure 2. Resting ECG. Sinus bradycardia 50 bpm， lack of R wave progression V1-4， and non-specific repolarization abnormalities with QTc 380 ms are apparent.\n\n【32】in her relatives. As typical pathologies related to VT (coronary artery disease， cardiomyopathies，and channelopathies) were excluded， idiopathic VT was considered as a primary working diagnosis. However， an electrophysiologist opined that our pa-tient's ECGs did not match a typical picture of idiopathic VT and scar-related arrhythmia was suspected (detailed descrip-tion in Figure 1 footnote). Therefore， the patient was referred for cMRl， which revealed tumorous contrast enhancement in the middle portion of interventricular septum (1x2.7 cm) and in the subendocardial region， in the basal segment of the right ventricle (Figure 3).\n\n【33】As the nature of the cardiac tumor could not be precisely es-tablished based on cMRl， a whole-body positron emission to-mography scan (18F-FDG-PET/CT) was performed. The scan revealed several foci of increased metabolism in multiple or-gans with maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) vary-ing from 5.3 to 14.5 (Figure 4).\n\n【34】Additionally， MRI of the brain disclosed a 12x13x10 mm lesion in the central part of the pons (Figure 5). The patient present-ed no symptoms typical of localized or disseminated infection or myocarditis. The markers for systemic inflammation and myocardial injury were within normal ranges. Disseminated sarcoidosis was considered as the most probable initial di-agnosis. Transbronchial biopsy of pulmonary foci， however，\n\n【35】Figure 3. Initial cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Tumorous enhancement detected by cardiac MRI in interventricular septum is indicated by the arrow.\n\n【36】appeared to be inconclusive as no abnormal cells were found on histopathology. For the abdominal foci， it was too risky to undergo biopsy， so targeted biopsy of the septal focus in the heart was performed. For this purpose， we used multiple-im-aging guidance， which included intraoperative fluoroscopy， transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)， and 3D electrophys-iological mapping with the CARTO System (Biosense Webster Inc.， Irvine， CA， USA) (Figure 6).\n\n【37】Figure 4. Whole-body 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on initial positron emission tomography scan. Foci of increased metabolism were found in (A) heart (indicated by arrows) and (B) lungs， spleen， and liver (indicated by arrows).\n\n【38】Figure 5. Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging. Scans of transverse plane (A)； sagittal plane (B)， and coronal plane (C) are shown. The lesion in the central part of the pons is indicated by the arrows.\n\n【39】The echocardiographer led the bioptome to the middle of the septum and electroanatomical mapping showed areas of sub-tle reduction of voltage which were considered to be connect-ed with the tumor. The subsequent histopathology disclosed an inflammatory pseudotumor (IP) with no signs of sarcoid-osis (Figure 7).\n\n【40】Therefore， bearing in mind that the patient had visited 4 dif-ferent continents during the previous 6 months， stepwise di-agnostics (Table 1) of possible causes of multiorgan IP were undertaken. The following tests gave positive results： (1)\n\n【41】IgG antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii， Aspergillus， and\n\n【42】Pneumocystis carinii； (2) IgM antibodies against Brucella sp；(3) antinuclear antibodies (1： 320). As the blood count， serum\n\n【43】protein electrophoresis，and C-reactive protein were all found to be normal， our consultant specialist in internal medicine found no indication for a bone marrow biopsy.\n\n【44】Multiorgan brucellosis or an autoimmunological disorder did not seem likely， but they were not impossible either. However， having considered a possibility of infection with Brucella mi-croorganisms， we meticulously reassessed the patient's his-tory of possible risky habits. It was disclosed that during her travels to central and southern Asia， as well as to the Middle East and southeastern Europe， she did consume non-pasteur-ized and non-processed milk， home-made cheese， and oth-er local meals. Additionally， during the 3-month period pre-ceding hospitalization， she had experienced several episodes\n\n【45】Figure 6. Intraprocedural 3D electrophysiological map created during endomyocardial biopsy. The low-voltage (red) area corresponding to the interventricular septum tumor is indicated by the arrow.\n\n【46】of fever and joint pains which were interpreted as seasonal common infections. Therefore， after consultation with a mul-tidisciplinary specialist team， we decided to start antimicro-bial treatment against Brucella sp. with ceftriaxone 2 g in-travenously， oral doxycycline 100 mg， twice daily， and oral rifampicin， 900 mg daily. Considering the potential for failure， steroid therapy was to be initiated if the antimicrobial treat-ment failed to resolve her symptoms. At 4 weeks of antibi-otic therapy， 18F-FDG-PET/CT revealed a significant regres-sion of the hypermetabolic foci (Figure 8)， and cerebral MRI disclosed a lower saturation of the lesion in the pons， inter-preted as a post-inflammatory scar. As we could not reliably estimate the risk of VT recurrence， the patient had a subcu-taneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (S-ICD) insert-ed (Figure 9). The antibiotic treatment was continued for 12weeks，when 18F-FDG-PET/CT revealed a full regression of all\n\n【47】Figure 7.

Approximately 2 and 4 years after the ces-sation of antibiotic therapy， the patient underwent addition-al general evaluations， which confirmed the regression of the disease. During S-ICD check-ups performed every 6 months， no arrhythmic events were detected (Table 2).\n\n【51】Discussion\n\n【52】We describe here the case of a patient in whom multiorgan brucellosis with cardiac involvement in the form of intraven-tricular tumor provoking symptomatic VT was considered the most probable diagnosis.\n\n【53】The possibility that the lesion was a neoplastic tumor was the keynote of our decisions； therefore， a whole-body PET/CT was\n\n【54】Table 1.

SUVmax of the foci fell within the range of overlap between malignant neoplasms and inflammatory lesions \\[3\\]. As the biopsy of foci in peripheral organs was either unsuccess-ful or posed too high a risk to be performed， targeted trans-venous biopsy of the interventricular septum was performed. Although a combination of echocardiography and fluorosco-py is usually used to guide biopsies of heart tumors \\[4\\]， we could not apply this technique because our patient's tumor was not clearly visible in echocardiography. Therefore， we per-formed additional 3D electroanatomical reconstruction of the intraventricular septum， which is known to target myocardial\n\n【64】scars in cardiomyopathies and cardiac masses \\[5\\]. Our ap-proach was unique in such a setting because in the majority of the reported cases of inflammatory cardiac pseudotumors， histopathology was performed either as post-mortem autop-sy or after cardiac surgeries that often entailed severe or le-thal complications \\[6\\].\n\n【65】The term “inflammatory pseudotumors\" describes various in-flammatory masses that are known by different names (most commonly as inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors， but also as plasma cell granuloma， histiocytoma， and others). IP etiol-ogy might include immunologic abnormalities， fibrogenetic disorders， specific reactions to an infectious agent， or abnor-malities related to trauma， necrosis， or neoplasm. The clinical course of IPs has not been precisely determined and their clas-sification is still uncertain. To date， neither diagnostic schemes nor adequate treatments have been agreed on \\[6-8\\]. IP sec-ondary to infections， including brucellosis， have only rarely been described.\n\n【66】As the biopsy revealed neither signs of neoplasm nor of sar-coidosis， a differential diagnosis became even more challeng-ing because the underlying causes of non-sarcoid inflammato-ry pseudotumors include a variety of pathologies that are not commonly diagnosed by cardiologists. Therefore， after multi-disciplinary consultations， diagnostic tests for specific infec-tions (bacterial， viral， fungal， protozoal， and helminthic) as well as rheumatic diseases were performed (Table 1). The obtained results were not straightforward， but did narrow down the probable causes of the underlying pathologies to 2 possibili-ties： brucellosis or an autoimmune disorder. Anti-inflammatory therapy with steroids could potentially exacerbate the course of infection if the cause were indeed brucellosis， and it was\n\n| Sep 4-18，  | First Hospitalization- General Cardiology Unit  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 2015  | · Symptoms： Palpitations and presyncope  |\n| 2015  | ·ECG (on admission) - Ventricular tachycardia 160-180 bpm  |\n| 2015  | · Direct current cardioversion  |\n| 2015  | ·ECG (resting) -Sinus bradycardia 47 bpm.

As this resulted in full resolution of the inflamma-tory lesions， the final diagnosis of the underlying cause of the IP was Brucella infection.\n\n【71】To the best of our knowledge， only one case of an inflammatory tumor in the interventricular septum of the heart has been pub-lished， and its underlying cause was not disclosed \\[9\\]. Cardiac involvement during Brucella infection may have different clin-ical manifestations： it can be limited to inflammation of the endocardium (usually on an aortic valve)， myocardium， or peri-cardium， but pancarditis has also been reported. On the other hand， infection with the Brucella microorganism can result in tumor-like lesions in different organs (eg， the liver or brain). It is thought that these lesions begin to develop in the acute phase as purulent-like foci that in time transform into pseu-dotumoral structures that develop into caseous necrotic tu-mors known as brucellomas \\[10\\]. Such unusual inflammato-ry structures are formed as a result of the suppressive effect Brucella microorganisms produce on the host immune system. Brucellosis presenting as cardiac IP has not been reported so far； thus， we found it baffling to accept such a clinical suspi-cion. Nevertheless， after stepwise and laborious work-up en-gaging several specialists of distinct medical disciplines， we deemed such a diagnosis as probable， which resulted in anti-biotic treatment initiation. Possible alternatives for therapy of\n\n【72】inflammatory pseudotumors include nonsteroidal anti-inflam-matory drugs or steroids and chemotherapeutic drugs， both of which are usually applied as adjuvant therapy to surgical resec-tion \\[11，12\\]. Of note， although some authors recommend surgi-cal resection as the optimal therapy for inflammatory pseudotu-mors \\[6\\]， in our case，this option was considered as the last-line treatment due to multiorgan lesions in unfavorable locations.\n\n【73】Life-threatening VTs and cardiac tumor-related sudden death cas-es have been reported \\[13\\]. The future risk of VT recurrence could not be reliably estimated in our patient due to the extremely rare etiology and uncertain dynamics of her inflammatory cardiac le-sions. As no stratification method (ie， invasive electrophysiologi-cal study) has been demonstrated in such a clinical scenario， we decided to implant a cardioverter-defibrillator. As the patient did not require permanent pacing and， bearing in mind that over the course of a 3-month in-hospital observation she had no VT re-currence， a subcutaneous device was chosen instead of a trans-venous system. Disadvantages of S-ICD systems include the in-ability to provide antitachycardia pacing in case of monomorphic VT； however， by not implanting the defibrillation lead into the right ventricle， we avoided its possible harmful interaction with the injured myocardium \\[14\\]. Other possible options could be a wearable cardioverter-defibrillator but taking into account obser-vations of recurrences of brucellosis， we decided that permanent protection with the implantable device might be a better option.\n\n【74】A vast diagnostic armamentarium of modern medicine allowed us to diagnose an unsuspected and rare cardiac inflammato-ry pseudotumor. In the case of travelers， the possibility of re gionally specific illnesses， especially infections， must be taken into consideration as possible causes of arrhythmias. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging may be useful in patients with‘idiopathic ventricular tachycardias' to detect non-appar-ent myocardial lesions， which may prove to be an underly-ing cause of the arrhythmia. Even though diagnosis exjuvan-tibus exists in medical practices， it is considered an inelegant\n\n【75】References：\n\n【76】1\\.

PCD is most commonly associated with gynecological and breast cancer， small-cell lung can-cer， and classical Hodgkin's lymphoma. The symptoms of PCD can arise several months before tumor diagno-sis. This report is of a case of a 44-year-old man with PCD that preceded the diagnosis of classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma by 16 months.\n\n【26】Case Report： A 44-year-old man was admitted to hospital with a cerebellar syndrome that was initially diagnosed as ver-tebrobasilar insufficiency. Eight months later， cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and serum anti-Tr antibodies supported the diagnosis of PCD， but no underlying malignancy was initially found. At 16months after the initial diagnosis of PCD， the patient developed an enlarged inguinal lymph node. Histology of the excisional lymph node biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of classic mixed cellularity Hodgkin’s lymphoma， Ann Arbor stage IIA. The patient responded to four cycles of adriamycin， bleomycin， vinblastine， and dacarba-zine (ABVD) chemotherapy.\n\n【27】Conclusions：\n\n【28】This case illustrates that in patients who present with PCD， an associated malignancy， such as classical Hodgkin's lymphoma， may emerge several months later， which supports long-term follow-up. The presence of anti-Tr anti-bodies may support a diagnosis of classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma in a patient with a history of PCD who devel-ops lymphadenopathy.\n\n【29】MeSH Keywords： Hodgkin Disease ·Neurologic Manifestations · Paraneoplastic Cerebellar Degeneration\n\n【30】Ful-text PDE https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/922342\n\n【31】Neurological paraneoplastic syndromes are rare and have been reported in less than 1% of patients with malignant neo-plasms \\[1-3\\]. The causes of paraneoplastic syndromes remain unknown but are not directly due to metastases， nutritional deficiency， infections， coagulopathies， or toxicity associated with the treatment of malignancy.\n\n【32】Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD) presents as a se-vere and acute or subacute cerebellar syndrome and is diag-nosed most commonly in patients with gynecological and breast cancers， small-cell lung cancer， and Hodgkin's lymphoma \\[1，2\\]. The detection of antineuronal autoantibodies against neuro-nal antigens may support the diagnosis of PCD， which prompts investigations for an underlying tumor.\n\n【33】The association between PCD and Hodgkin’s lymphoma was first described by Trotter et al. in 1976 \\[4\\]. The delta/notch-like epidermal growth factor (EGFR)-related receptor (DNER) is the target antigen of the anti-Tr antibody response in para-neoplastic syndromes and is also present in the Purkinje cells of the central nervous system (CNS) \\[5，6\\]. PCD is associated with extensive loss of Purkinje cells \\[2，7，8\\] and is also asso-ciated with inflammatory infiltrates in the cerebellar cortex， deep cerebellar nuclei， and inferior olivary nuclei of the me-dulla oblongata \\[2\\]. Although the symptoms of paraneoplastic syndromes can appear after or at the same time as the diag-nosis of malignancy， they occur most commonly before the di-agnosis of malignancy \\[1，9\\]. However， if the clinician is aware of the diagnosis of a paraneoplastic syndrome， such as PCD， malignancy such as Hodgkin's lymphoma may be diagnosed more rapidly. This report is of a case of a 44-year-old man with PCD that preceded the diagnosis of classical Hodgkin’s lym-phoma by 16 months.\n\n【34】Case Report\n\n【35】A 44-year-old man who worked as a farmer， with no prior sig-nificant medical history， was admitted to the emergency room with mild dysarthria， dizziness， unsteady gait， and sudden ep-isodes of loss of consciousness. He spontaneously recovered after three days. He denied experiencing numbness， weakness， dysphagia， photophobia， clonus， rigidity， or anal sphincter re-laxation. No accompanying fever， weight loss， or other systemic findings were reported. Laboratory investigations showed mild leukocytosis (11.87x10/pL) and neutrophilia (8.9x10/pL)，and a cranial computed tomography (CT) was normal. He was dis-charged on 100 mg daily of oral acetylsalicylic acid.\n\n【36】Four days later， he was readmitted and hospitalized following presentation with slurred speech， lack of balance on walking，\n\n【37】and weakness of the lower extremities. Physical examina-tion also showed bilateral vertical nystagmus and cerebellar ataxia. During this admission， supra-aortic angio-CT and cere-bral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed， but no imaging abnormalities were found. Neurosonology imag ing showed mild stenosis in the right cerebral artery and bas-ilar artery. The patient was discharged with the provisional di-agnosis of vertebrobasilar insufficiency.\n\n【38】The patient's clinical condition became worse， and he was un-able to perform activities of daily living， but serial cranial CT scans showed no abnormality. He used a wheelchair. His mod-ified Rankin score for neurological disability was 5 out of 6. Other symptoms included irritability， severe dysarthria， bilat-eral nystagmus， dysdiadochokinesia， a positive Holmes' sign， truncal ataxia， and an ataxic gait. A second MRI showed cere-bellar atrophy. He had normal electromyography and a normal electroencephalogram. The detection of serum antibodies to Tr， the target antigen of delta/notch-like epidermal growth factor(EGFR)-related receptor (DNER)， and cerebral MRI findings sup-ported a diagnosis of paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration(PCD)， eight months after the onset of the neurological symp-toms. He was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)(20 gm/24 h) for five days but without clinical improvement.\n\n【39】Following a diagnosis of PCD， the patient was investigated for an underlying malignancy. CT imaging of the neck， thorax， ab-domen， and pelvis was negative. A combined positron emis-sion tomography (PET) and CT scan identified a metabolically active subcranial lymph node measuring 2 cm in diameter， with a maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) of 4 (liver SUV of2.6)， and cerebellar hypoactivity. The histology of a transbron-chial needle aspiration biopsy was nonspecific. The enlarged subcranial lymph was not visible in a second PET-CT investiga-tion four months later. As no malignancy was identified， the pa-tient continued to be treated with IIG without chemotherapy.\n\n【40】Sixteen months after the initial diagnosis of PCD was made， the patient developed an enlarged left inguinal lymph node measuring 3 cm in diameter， which was identified by the pa-tient's relatives. PET-CT imaging showed a single infradiaphrag-matic lymph node in the left iliac and inguinal regions (SUVmax16.64)， with generalized mild lymphadenopathy. Histology of the excisional lymph node biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of clas-sic mixed cellularity Hodgkin's lymphoma， Ann Arbor stage IIA.\n\n【41】The patient was treated with four cycles of chemotherapy con-sisting of adriamycin， bleomycin， vinblastine， and dacarbazine(ABVD) and achieved a complete metabolic response after the second cycle， which was confirmed by PET. At the last follow-up， two years after the diagnosis of Hodgkin’s lymphoma， the patient had a complete response， and anti-Tr antibodies remained negative. However， the patient experienced minor\n\n【42】improvements in his neurological symptoms， with residual dysarthria， dependency on the use of a wheelchair， and per-sistent mood disorder.\n\n【43】Discussion\n\n【44】Despite the presence of a tumor， neurologic syndromes of an unknown cause do not always represent a paraneoplastic syndrome. The detection of onconeural antibodies has been of great importance in indicating the presence of a tumor. However， a paraneoplastic syndrome is not always associated with onconeural antibodies， and a neurological syndrome may not exist despite detecting these antibodies \\[1，10\\].\n\n【45】In 2004， diagnostic criteria for paraneoplastic neurological syndromes were proposed to include definite and possible cases \\[10\\]. A set of diagnostic criteria was based on the pres-ence or absence of malignancy for classical paraneoplastic syn-drome with the use of well-characterized onconeural antibod-ies \\[10\\]. More recently， two onconeural antibodies have been added to the list of well-characterized onconeural antibodies. including antibodies to Sox1 and Tr \\[1，11\\].\n\n【46】Paraneoplastic syndromes are a rare association with lym-phoma. The type and frequency of paraneoplastic syndromes are different between classical Hodgkin's lymphoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Limbic encephalitis (LE) and PCD are almost exclusively seen in patients with Hodgkin's lym-phoma. Usually， lymphomas are associated with unique para-neoplastic syndromes， but the co-occurrence of paraneoplas-tic syndromes have also been reported \\[12，13\\]. Sensorimotor neuropathies and dermatomyositis are more common in Hodgkin's lymphoma， but the association between Hodgkin's lymphoma and acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy(AMSAN) has also been recently reported \\[14\\].\n\n【47】The largest published case series included 28 patients with PCD who had anti-Tr antibodies， 25 of whom were diagnosed with classical Hodgkin's lymphoma \\[7\\]. The diagnosis of PCD preceded the diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma in 20 patients with a median time between the development of paraneoplas-tic syndrome and tumor diagnosis of 3.5 months (range，0-24months) \\[7\\]. This finding has been supported by other stud-ies \\[3，9，15\\]. The majority of patients with PCD and Hodgkin's lymphoma were male， and the most common histopathologic type was nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphoma \\[7\\]. In anoth-er case series， the diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma preceded the neurologic symptoms in 17/21 patients \\[16\\]. The reason for the different clinical presentations is unclear \\[7\\].\n\n【48】In this present report， a case was presented of a patient with PCD in with neurological symptoms diagnosed 16 months\n\n【49】before the diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma. This case report is unusual because 16 months is one of the longest periods between the onset of PCD and the diagnosis of Hodgkin's lym-phoma. Chepovetsky et al. published a case report of an old-er man with PCD who was anti-Tr antibody-positive who pre-sented without an initial detectable underlying neoplasm， in whom Hodgkin’s lymphoma was diagnosed two years later \\[3\\].\n\n【50】It is possible that in cases of paraneoplastic syndrome with cerebellar manifestations， such as PCD， with anti-Tr antibod-ies， Hodgkin's lymphoma should be excluded during long-term follow-up. In this report， the diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma was made after 16 months from the onset of cerebellar neuro-logical symptoms， which meant that the effective treatment of the lymphoma did not improve the patient's neurological defi-cit. Earlier therapeutic intervention might have resulted in im-proved neurological outcome. Under such circumstances， the use of new methodologies， such as liquid biopsy， which can detect mutations associated with the disease， could improve diagnosis \\[17\\]. This patient had some unique clinical features. He developed dizziness， dysarthria， and ataxic gait early on， rather than prodromal symptoms， followed by progression to ataxia， diplopia， dysarthria， and dysphagia \\[2\\]. The initial ce-rebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRl) findings were nor-mal， although some patients show minor abnormalities \\[2，9\\]. The only abnormality detected in this patient was the devel-opment of cerebellar atrophy， as shown by MRI (Figure 1)， which was consistent with low fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) up-take in positron emission tomography and computed tomog-raphy (PET-CT) imaging \\[2，8，18\\] (Figure 2).\n\n【51】The pathogenesis of PCD remains unclear， but it features ex-tensive loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells， associated with inflam-matory infiltrates in the cerebellar cortex， deep cerebellar nu-clei， and inferior olivary nuclei \\[1，6，7，8\\]. Neuronal loss is a result of the intrathecal synthesis of anti-Tr antibodies targeting the delta/notch-like epidermal growth factor (EGFR)-related recep-tor (DNER) transmembrane protein that is preferentially ex-pressed in the Purkinje cell dendrites \\[1，6，19\\]. DNER has not yet been identified in tissue samples of Hodgkin's lymphoma， which suggests that the immune response is not controlled by ectopic tumor expression of the antigen \\[1\\].\n\n【52】The most useful diagnostic test for PCD is the detection of onco-neuronal antibodies in serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). As in this case， the Tr antibody is no longer present after the treat-ment of classical Hodgkin's lymphoma \\[7\\]. Early treatment of the underlying malignancy is essential for stabilizing or improv-ing the patient's neurological symptoms in PCD \\[2，6，7，15，20\\]. Usually， plasma exchange， intravenous immunoglobulin (IG)， orimmunosuppressive treatment with corticosteroids or cyclo-phosphamide are ineffective. However， Gungor et al. described an 11-year-old boy in whom chemotherapy did not result in\n\n【53】Arratibel N. et al：\n\n【54】Figure 1.

(A) Sagittal cerebral T1-weighted MRI at one month (B)， two months， and (C) at sixth months after clinical onset. Cerebral MRI shows cortical and subcortical atrophy at the supratentorial and infratentorial levels and marked cerebellar atrophy.\n\n【55】any neurological recovery， but subsequent plasmapheresis with immunoadsorption and immunoglobulin was followed by improvement of neurological symptoms \\[15\\]. The progno-sis of PCD can be poor， even in cases where antitumor thera-py is started promptly and the antibodies are removed. It has been estimated that only 14% of patients recover or experi-ence improvement in their neurological changes 1，7，16J.New strategies， such as non-invasive detection of genomic imbal-ances in early and advanced stages of Hodgkin's lymphoma by sequencing of circulating cell-free DNA， could enable earli-er diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma \\[17\\].\n\n【56】Conclusions\n\n【57】Figure 2. Axial cerebral imaging with 18-fluorodeoxyglucose\n\n【58】(FDG) positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT) shows a reduction of metabolic activity in the cerebellum in a 44-year-old man with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD) who developed classical mixed cellularity Hodgkin's lymphoma 16 months later.\n\n【59】Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD) is a rare condi-tion that can present as an acute or subacute cerebellar syn-drome. This case illustrates that in patients who present with PCD， an associated malignancy， such as classical Hodgkin's lym-phoma， may emerge several months later， which supports the need for long-term follow-up. The presence of anti-Tr antibod-ies may support a diagnosis of classical Hodgkin's lymphoma in a patient with a history of PCD who develops lymphadenop-athy. Rapid diagnosis and treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma in patients with PCD may prevent the development of irrevers-ible cerebellar symptoms due to neuronal loss.\n\n【60】Conflict of interest\n\n【61】None.\n\n【62】1\\.

Therefore， laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) and totally extraperitoneal (TEP) techniques are frequently preferred.\\[2-4\\]\n\n【8】Copyright @ 2019 by the International Sci Ink Press\n\n【9】DOI：10.5455/IJMRCR.Single-Port-Laparoscopic-Transabdomional-Preperitoneal First Received： April 13， 2019\n\n【10】Accepted： May 10，2019\n\n【11】Associate Editor： Ivan Inkov (BG)；\n\n【12】1Assist professor， Department of Surgery MMIMSR mullana Ambala 133207；\n\n【13】kirtisgoyal@gmail.com\n\n【14】When comparing the two techniques， TAPP is easier to learn and may be associated with a shorter learning curve.\\[5\\] Re-cent studies have been focused on minimising further the in-vasiveness of laparoscopy by reducing the number of incisions and the port size.

All the patients (100%) had a unilateral inguinal hernia.\n\n【79】Postoperative complications were significantly more in con-ventional TAPP (p<0.01) with none converted to conventional TAPP or open surgery.\n\n【80】Discussion\n\n【81】Fifty patients who presented with chief complaints of groin swelling of one or more months were included in our study excluding the pediatric patients. In our study of 25 patients， each who underwent single-port TAPP and conventional TAPP the mean age were 44.86 and 44.06 respectively which were similar to study done by Tai HC et al 9 (46.5years)， Ertem M et al10 (53 years).\n\n【82】In our study， the meantime for single port TAPP was 81.5 min which was significantly lesser to conventional TAPP as in the study by Tai HC et al. who successfully operated on 24 patients with a mean operative time of 83.5 mins and none was converted to conventional TAPP. Similarly， in a study by Sato et al \\[11\\]，who successfully treated 35 patients with a mean operative time of91.2 mins. In a study of 47 patients by Etem M et al.， mean operative time was 96.48 mins. The mean operative time in our study of 25 patients for conventional TAPP was 95.5 mins while in study done by Sato H et al. was 86.1 mins.\n\n【83】In our study of 25 patients with single port TAPP， postopera-tive complications were reported in 1 (4%) patient who devel-oped seroma， which was treated with repeated aspiration. Simi-larly， Tai H et al. in his study found 2 patients (12.5%) suffering from postoperative complications. Similarly， for conventional TAPP in our study of 25 patients， 6(24%) had postoperative complications，5(20%) developed urinary retention and1(4%) developed postoperative umbilical hernia from the umbilical port which was operated after six months. Hawasli A et al\\[12\\]， performed conventional TAPP for recurrent inguinal hernia de-veloped postoperative complications in 18 patients (13%) which include 15 hematomas， two seromas and one urinary retention. Reoccurrence occurred in one patient (0.7%) in whom staples were not used.\n\n【84】In our study of 25 patients with single port TAPP， the mean\n\n【85】postoperative hospital stay was 1.75 days which was signifi-cantly lesser than conventional TAPP (3.5 days)， which was in accordance to study done by JiHoon Kim et al\\[13\\] and Lee YS et al\\[14\\] with a mean hospital stay of 2.15 days and 2 days respec-tively. Thus when compared to conventional technique single port TAPP offers：\n\n【86】1\\. Lesser duration of surgery and general anaesthesia\n\n【87】2\\. Lesser postoperative complications\n\n【88】3\\. Lesser hospital stay and early recovery\n\n【89】4\\. Almost no reoccurrence.\n\n【90】The main disadvantage of single port TAPP includes a lim-ited range of movement due to the proximity of working ports， limited triangulation.\n\n【91】Conclusion\n\n【92】Single port TAPP using same method and instrument as in con-ventional TAPP offers to be safe and efficient with minimum reoccurences and shorter hospital stay.\n\n【93】Competing Interests\n\n【94】The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest in this study.\n\n【95】Funding\n\n【96】All funds in this study were covered by the personal fund of the authors.\n\n【97】Ethics Committee\n\n【98】None.\n\n【99】References\n\n【100】1\\.

Synchronous malignancies are uncommon， involving only 2.4-8% of all cancer cases， with a very low num-ber of cases of simultaneous gastric and pancreatic cancer. Although cases of synchronous malignancies do ex-ist， synchronous pancreatic adenocarcinoma and signet ring cell (SRC) gastric adenocarcinoma have not been documented.\n\n【29】Case Report：\n\n【30】A 76-year-old woman with a previously diagnosed intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) present-ed with left-sided abdominal pain. Initial workup， including computed tomography imaging and endoscopic ultrasound with biopsy， led to the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Within 1 month of diagnosis， the patient underwent an extended Whipple procedure and was also found to have a primary SRC gastric adeno-carcinoma on evaluation of the gastric tissue margins that were removed during the procedure. The patient was initiated on chemoradiation therapy with 5-fluorouracil. However， following a subsequent decline in per-formance status and multiple hospitalizations， she could not tolerate further cancer treatment and died soon afterwards.\n\n【31】Conclusions：\n\n【32】Few cases of synchronous malignancies involving the stomach and pancreas have been reported. Because gas-tric cancer could easily be missed on screening endoscopy； physicians must have a high index of suspicion. In those patients with a prior history of cancer， biopsies should be performed to aid in early diagnosis. To our knowledge， only metachronous cases of SRC gastric and pancreatic adenocarcinoma have been documented. Therefore， this report represents the first case of synchronous SRC gastric adenocarcinoma and IPMN-associated pancreatic adenocarcinoma in the literature.\n\n【33】Keywords： Neoplasms， Multiple Primary · Pancreatic Cancer， Adult · Stomach Neoplasms\n\n【34】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/935242\n\n【35】品111754 3 22\n\n【36】Synchronous malignancy is a term used to refer to multiple pri-mary cancers that are diagnosed in a single individual at the same time or within a 2-month period \\[1\\]. Per Vogt et al， it is estimated to be diagnosed in only 2.4-8% of all cancer cas-es， making it an uncommon finding with a poor prognosis \\[2\\]. Currently， synchronous malignancies most commonly occur in cases of gastric carcinoma； however， reports of coexisting gastric and pancreatic cancer are limited and account for only3.8% of all synchronous carcinoma cases per Muroni et al \\[3\\]. Even more uncommon are synchronous cases of signet ring cell (SRC) gastric cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma， of which there are no prior documented reports. Therefore， we present a case of a patient who underwent resection for pan-creatic adenocarcinoma and then was found to have a distinct-ly separate primary SRC gastric adenocarcinoma.\n\n【37】Case Report\n\n【38】A 76-year-old Caucasian woman presented with left-sided ab-dominal pain， nausea， and poor appetite accompanied by a10-pound unintentional weight loss. Significant past medical history included gastric ulcer disease status post-antrectomy with a Billroth I reconstruction， with previously unremarkable biopsies and known intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm(IPMN) for which the patient had continued followup with gas-troenterology and surgical oncology. The patient denied alco-hol， tobacco， or drug abuse and family history was insignificant.\n\n【39】On physical examination， her temperature was 97.7°F， blood pressure 132/70 mmHg， and heart rate 87 beats per minute. Her abdomen was soft and nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds but left upper and lower quadrant tenderness with guarding was present. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was completed and showed a 4.7-cm multiloculated cystic lesion in the pancreatic head along with the development of pancreatic ductal dilatation measur-ing 10 mm (Figure 1A). Thickening of the gastric antrum was also present. Given the patient's history of known pancreat-ic cysts， a previous study completed 2 years prior was avail-able for comparison and showed findings consistent with an IPMN that measured 2.5 cm and communicated with the main pancreatic duct， which measured 3 mm. Additional review of previous endoscopic ultrasounds (EUS) displayed no concern-ing features. Followup assessment of cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) level was 223 ng/mL. Repeat EUS and fine needle as-piration (FNA) was recommended for further evaluation giv-en the increasing size of the cysts. The patient did undergo EUS， which showed an irregular solid-cystic mass with grape-like cystic regions measuring 4.8 cm， in the head of the pan-creas. FNA ofthe lesion using a transduodenal approach with\n\n【40】Figure 1. (A) Abdominal CT showed 4.7-cm multiloculated cystic lesions in the pancreas head/body (arrow).(B) Endoscopic ultrasound showed a heterogeno us solid and cystic mass， similar in size to that visualized by the CT scan， in the pancreatic body (arrows). (C) The pancreatic duct was dilated to 15 mm (arrow).\n\n【41】a 25-gauge needle revealed adenocarcinoma (Figure 1B， 1C). Further imaging showed no metastasis and preoperative esoph-agogastroduodenoscopy showed no mucosal findings concern-ing for malignancy.\n\n【42】Figure 2. (A-C)： H&E stain (10x) of pancreatic tissue (A) showing well-defined malignant glands (arrows). A loss of expression of DPC4revealed by immunohistochemistry stain (10x) in (B) and weak to absent nuclear expression on CDX1 immunohistochemistry(10x) in (C) confirmed a diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. (D-F)： (D) H&E stain (20x) of gastric antral tissue showing poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet ring features. (E) DPC4 immunohistochemistry stain (20x) and (F) CDX2immunohistochemistry stain (20x) showing intact nuclear expression within the gastric carcinoma.\n\n【43】Figure 3. (A) Area of erosion (arrow) seen proximal to the gastrojejunostomy junction. (B) Biopsy taken from the area resulting in minor bleeding (arrow).\n\n【44】One month later， the patient underwent an extended Whipple procedure. Histological evaluation of the pancreatic tissue showed IPMN of the gastric type which was contiguous with the multifocal invasive tubular-type adenocarcinoma that ex-tended into the pancreatic duct (Figure 2A-2C). Unfortunately， evaluation of the gastric tissue at the margins demonstrated poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma that was morphologi-cally different from the pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Given the new gastric findings， the patient underwent repeat esopha-gogastroduodenoscopy with gastric mapping to further eval-uate the extent of the synchronous gastric cancer. The esoph-agogastroduodenoscopy revealed a residual area of erosion at the gastrojejunostomy junction (Figure 3)， and the biopsy taken from this area reidentified the presence of poorly differ-entiated gastric adenocarcinoma with focal SRC morphology involving both the gastric mucosa and submucosa. This was further confirmed through immunohistochemistry evaluation. The malignant pancreatic tissue showed weak to absent DPC4and CDX2 expression while the gastric tissue showed strong expression of both (Figure 2D-2F).\n\n【45】Following the Whipple procedure and incidental diagnosis of synchronous gastric adenocarcinoma， the patient was referred to both medical and radiation oncology. The decision was made to initiate her on preoperative concurrent chemoradiation ther-apy with 5-fluorouracil for the pancreatic and gastric cancer along with radiation to the affected pancreatic area. The plan was for her to then eventually undergo complete pancreatec-tomy and possible gastrectomy. Unfortunately， the patient’s baseline health status continued to decline， leading to multi-ple hospitalizations and failure to thrive with inability to toler-ate chemoradiation. The patient rapidly deteriorated， and she and her family agreed to transition to palliative care. The pa-tient subsequently died shortly after. Prior to her death， she\n\n【46】had been set up to undergo genetic and genomic testing but died prior to this being completed.\n\n【47】Discussion\n\n【48】Cases of multiple primary tumors can be separated into 2 cat-egories： synchronous and metachronous. Synchronous can-cers are those in which multiple independent， primary cancers are diagnosed within a 2-month time period， while metachro-nous cancers are cases of successive primary cancers diag-nosed more than 2 months apart \\[1\\]. Our patient was diag-nosed with a synchronous malignancy composed of a primary tubular-type pancreatic adenocarcinoma and primary SRC gas-tric adenocarcinoma.\n\n【49】Primary pancreatic carcinomas infrequently coexist alongside a second primary malignancy. Smaller cohort studies such as Su-Jin Shin et al report an incidence of 8.4% for pancreat-ic cancers being associated with double cancers while larg-er cohort studies such as Makino et al report an incidence of5.6%\\[4，5\\]. This is likely attributable to the fact that pancreat-ic malignancies have a high mortality rate that mirrors their incidence \\[6\\]. Diagnosis is challenging as pancreatic cancer of-ten remains asymptomatic until advanced disease develops， with 90% of cases being complicated by distant metastasis. In the 20% of cases for which initial resection was offered as a potential treatment option， the 5-year survival rate was25%， and many patients unfortunately experience disease re-currence \\[6，7\\]. Therefore， pancreatic cancer patients typically have a short life expectancy， and this theoretically limits their likelihood of developing a second malignancy. However， as ad-vancements in medicine are made， the prognosis of pancreatic cancer is improving. Consequently， improving survival and life\n\n【50】expectancy places individuals at a hypothetically increased risk of developing double cancers， leading to increasing incidence.\n\n【51】IPMN is a major risk factor and a precursor of pancreatic ad-enocarcinoma. There are different types of IPMN that are dif ferentiated on the basis of their epithelial lining and each is associated with a different likelihood of invasion and risk of malignant progression \\[8，9\\]. Our patient had a gastric-type IPMN， which has a very favorable prognosis and a lower like-lihood of malignant progression in comparison with the high-er-grade intestinal and pancreatobiliary types \\[8\\]. For this rea-son and despite the classified type， patients with identified IPMN must undergo routine examination and surveillance to ensure early detection of progression to pancreatic adenocar-cinoma. Additionally， studies have shown that IPMN has been seen to accompany other forms of independent malignancies； specifically， different forms of gastric and ductal carcinoma of the pancreas. IPMN should therefore serve as a diagnostic clue to prompt more thorough examination and workup \\[10\\].\n\n【52】Endoscopy with gastric biopsies is the gold standard for diag-nosing various forms of gastric cancer. Although endoscopy has proven to be a very successful method for detecting gas-tric cancer， frequent discussions have been had regarding the magnitude of missed lesions \\[11\\]. A systemic review and me-ta-analysis completed by Pimenta-Melo et al revealed that 1out of 10 gastric cancers could potentially be missed by en-doscopic screening \\[12\\]. Poor endoscopic techniques， location and size of the cancer， and lack of mucosal invasion result-ing in failure to obtain biopsies can all result in missed or de-layed diagnosis of cancer \\[13\\]. In addition to pancreatic adeno-carcinoma in the setting of IPMN， our patient was also found to have a synchronous SRC gastric adenocarcinoma. The SRC gastric adenocarcinoma was diagnosed through histological analysis of the gastric margins from the Whipple procedure. Preoperative endoscopy was completed a month prior to the operation but no biopsies were taken as no mucosal findings suggesting gastric cancer had been seen at that time. It can therefore be speculated that the gastric cancer may have been present at that time， but missed due to the cancer originating in the submucosa. In retrospect， it is important to have a high index of suspicion in patients with IPMNs， especially those with known pancreatic cancer， as these patients would benefit from more aggressive endoscopic surveillance and routine biopsies.\n\n【53】To our knowledge， no synchronous cases of SRC gastric ade-nocarcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma have been doc-umented； only metachronous occurrence has been reported in the literature. In such cases， the gastric cancer was diag-nosed 5-19 years following the diagnosis of pancreatic ma-lignancy \\[14\\]. The patients were between 38-68 years of age， predominantly males， and from diverse ethnicities \\[14-17\\]. Some patients survived for years after undergoing successful\n\n【54】gastrectomy \\[15\\] while others died shortly after palliative sur-gery \\[16\\]. This highlights the importance of early diagnosis and prompt treatment， along with continuous aggressive sur-veillance for secondary malignancies. The exact cause behind the development of SRC gastric carcinoma following surgical resection for pancreatic adenocarcinoma is unknown， but the most widely recognized hypothesis attributes this to morpho-logical mucosal changes that result from prolonged biliary re-flux following pancreatoduodenectomy \\[15，16\\].\n\n【55】In previous cases of synchronous occurrence of pancreatic and gastric cancers， pancreatic adenocarcinoma has been found to coexist with Lauren intestinal-type gastric adenocarcinoma \\[3\\]， gastric tubular adenocarcinoma \\[18\\]， gastric mucinous adeno-carcinoma \\[19\\]， and gastrointestinal stromal tumors \\[20\\].The present case is unique in that it documents the only synchro-nous case of SRC gastric cancer and primary pancreatic adeno-carcinoma in the literature to date. In the present case and all cases of synchronous and metachronous double cancer， genet-ic and genomic testing should be completed， given their rarity， high morbidity and mortality， and history of a hereditary ba-sis. Although our patient was unable to undergo testing， test-ing for mutations in the STK11 (Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome)， ABO， and BRCA1/2 genes， as well as the Lynch-syndrome-associated genes MLH1， MSH2， and MSH6， should be completed to iden-tify a hereditary component in each case of disease \\[6，21，22\\].\n\n【56】Conclusions\n\n【57】While there are documented cases of various synchronous ma-lignancies， this is the first documented case in the literature of SRC gastric adenocarcinoma and IPMN-associated pancre-atic adenocarcinoma. It is important to recognize that gastric carcinoma can often be missed during perioperative screening endoscopy and therefore proceduralists should have a high in-dex of suspicion and low threshold to perform biopsies in pa-tients who have already been diagnosed with a single primary malignancy. Pancreatic and gastric malignancies independently carry poor prognoses， making early diagnosis imperative as a synchronous malignancy of this type is a very grim diagnosis.\n\n【58】Site of Research Project\n\n【59】Gastroenterology Department， St. Luke’s University Health Network， Bethlehem Campus， 801 Ostrum St.， Suite 201， Bethlehem， PA 18015， USA.\n\n【60】Declaration of Figures’Authenticity\n\n【61】All figures submitted have been created by the authors who confirm that the images are original with no duplication and have not been previously published in whole or in part.\n\n【62】1\\.

As seen after the Second wave， patients with COVID-19 are at high risk of fungal infections， such as mucormycosis， that may result directly from COVID-19 infection and/or as a side effect of the drugs used in the COVID-19 treatment protocol. Rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis is a fungal infection that can be fatal， especially in immunocompromised patients. In this report， we described a series of 3 cases with frontal sinus osteomyelitis in post-COVID-19 diabetic patients diagnosed with mucormycosis.\n\n【4】KEYWORDS COVID-19，Mucormycosis， Frontal Sinus， Osteomyelitis， Diabetes mellitus\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】During the global Covid pandemic， there is an increase in the rate of secondary infections， among which mucormycosis is one. This is a severe， opportunistic fungal infection that can also cause fatal outcomes in several immunocompromised states， such as uncontrolled diabetes， decreased neutrophil counts， chronic use of glucocorticoid steroids， haematological malignan-cies， and chronic malnutrition(1-2). Organs commonly involved are lungs， sinuses， nose， brain， eyes， skin， kidneys and gastroin-testinal tract. (3) Occurrence of Vascular thrombosis leading to tissue necrosis is a remarkable sign of this disease(4). The most common presentation of mucormycosis is Rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM) which contributes to about two-thirds of all cases(5，6)\n\n【7】ROCM is a rapidly progressing disease， which can lead to grievous consequences if the diagnosis or treatment is delayed. However， the prognosis can be much better if the warning signs and symptoms are observed correctly with appropriate inves-tigations and aggressive treatment of the disease with medical and surgical interventions(8-9).\n\n【8】Pott's puffy tumour is a severe complication of ROCM. It is osteomyelitis of the frontal bone， associated with subperiosteal\n\n【9】Copyright @ 2022 by the Bulgarian Association of Young Surgeons\n\n【10】DO： 10.5455/JMRCR.172-1643656463\n\n【11】First Received： February 6， 2022\n\n【12】Accepted： April 27， 2022\n\n【13】Associate Editor： Ivan Inkov (BG)；\n\n【14】abscess causing oedema and swelling over the forehead and scalp.\n\n【15】As the cases of ROCM are increasing in incidence throughout the world after the emergence of Covid 19， we present 3 cases of post COVID mucormycosis presented at the Tertiary Care Center who developed frontal osteomyelitis and Pott’s puffy tumour as a late complication and were given surgical and medical management.\n\n【16】Case 1：\n\n【17】A 37-year-old male patient complained of headaches， ptosis of the right eyelid and diminution of vision in the right eye. The patient was newly diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus on presenting to the hospital. The patient gave a history of COVID infection 20 days back， for which he was home quarantined. The patient was investigated with CT PNS， which was sugges-tive of mucosal thickening involving all sinuses and bilateral osteomeatal and left frontoethmoidal recess obliteration. Hence the patient was started on intravenous Amphotericin B therapy and operated on for Endoscopic sinus surgery with debride-ment under GA. The tissue excised from the debridement of sinuses after the histopathological examination is suggestive of Mucormycosis of paranasal sinuses. The patient was managed with a transcutaneous retrobulbar Amphotericin B (TRAMB) in-jection for ophthalmological symptoms. Adjuvant management was given to control BSL.\n\n【18】After 25 days of lyophilised Amphotericin B therapy， the pa-tient developed a unilateral frontal headache on the left side and swelling over the left frontal bone. On CT paranasal sinuses， it\n\n【19】suggested erosion and heterogenous enhancement in walls of left frontal sinus involving adjacent anteroinferior part of left bone and roof of left orbit suggestive of osteomyelitis changes with a collection of abscess in the lateral aspect(as shown in fig-ure 1). The rest of the sinuses showed mild mucosal thickening overall with no evidence of bony erosions elsewhere. The patient was operated on for left-sided frontal craniotomy to remove the diseased anterior wall of the frontal sinus. The further patient completed the Amphotericin B therapy and was symptomati-cally relieved with clear sinuses on imaging (as shown in figure2).\n\n【20】Figure 1\n\n【21】Figure 2\n\n【22】Case 2：\n\n【23】A 50-year-old male patient reported a bilateral frontal headache to the OPD for 15 days， not subsiding with medications. The pa-tient gave a history of COVID infection one month back. He was hospitalized and received an Injection of Remdesivir and steroid therapy. He was newly diagnosed as a case of Diabetes Mellitus after he was hospitalized for COVID treatment. After inves-tigation， CT PNS suggested mucosal thickening of all sinuses and was operated for Endoscopic sinus surgery with debride-ment (as shown in figure 3). The tissue resected was sent for histopathological examination， which suggested mucormycosis infection. The patient was started on Amphotericin B therapy. After 1 month of treatment for mucormycosis patient developed a severe frontal headache. On MRI brain with paranasal sinuses，\n\n【24】it was suggestive of erosion of focal lytic areas in anterior walls， roof and floor of bilateral frontal sinus along with stranding and swelling of overlying scalp likely to be osteomyelitis of frontal bone. The patient was managed medically with intravenous antibiotics and Amphotericin B for the next month， after which the patient showed healthy mucosal lining in the frontal sinus. A repeat scan showed healthy frontal bone(as shown in figure4).\n\n【25】Figure 3\n\n【26】Figure 4\n\n【27】Case 3：\n\n【28】A 42-year female presented to our hospital with bilateral frontal sinus swelling and draining sinuses over the skin for 1 month. The patient gives a history of bilateral periorbital swelling 1month back. She had a history of COVID infection 4 months ago. The patient was a newly diagnosed case of Diabetes Mellitus with uncontrolled blood sugar levels. CT PNS showed mucosal thickening with soft tissue opacification in the bilateral frontal sinus with permeative bone destruction associated with cortical break in the anterior and posterior walls of the bilateral frontal sinus and the orbital roof.\n\n【29】The patient was treated with bifrontal craniotomy with the removal of infected frontal bone followed by debridement and reconstruction of the frontal sinus (as shown in Figures 5， 6， and 7). Postoperatively， the patient was medically managed with Amphotericin B and monitored for nephrotoxicity. The follow-up of the patient was satisfactory.\n\n| Case no.  | Presentigsymptoms  | Age/Sex  | Medical History  | Surgical treatment  | Antifungal therapy  | Outcome  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1.  | Headache， Ptosis ofright eyelid，diminution of vision in right eye.  | 37y/male  | Uncontrolled DiabetesMellitus，h/o COVID-19 infection  | Endoscopic sinussurgery with LeftFrontal craniotomy  | LiposomalAmphotericin B， Posaconazole  | Satisfactory Followup upto 3 months.  |\n| 2.  | Frontal headachenot controlled bymedication  | 50y/male  | Uncontrolled DiabetesMellitus，h/o COVID-19 infection  | Endoscopic sinussuirgery  | LiposomalAmphotericin B，Posaconazole  | Satisfactory Followup upto 5 months  |\n| 3.  | Bilateral periorbitaledema and frontalswelling  | 42y/ female  | Uncontrolled DiabetesMellitus，h/o COVID-19 infection  | Bilateral FrontalCraniotomy  | LiposomalAmphotericin B，Posaconazole  | Satisfactory Followup upto 2 months  |\n\n【31】Figure 5\n\n【32】Figure 7\n\n【33】Discussion\n\n【34】Mucormycosis is a potentially fatal condition. Medical treatment alone is ineffective since drug transport to the site of infection is insufficient due to severe arterial thrombosis (11). The prognosis of the underlying disease and the reversal of the predisposing state determine the ultimate fate of mucormycosis. Although greater survival rates of up to 80-85 percent have lately been reported， the mortality rate has been proven to be 50%(12-14) The degree of disease， both orbital and intracranial extension in cases of rhinoorbitocerebral mucormycosis， is also a prognostic factor(11)\n\n【35】Figure 6\n\n【36】The overall risk increases if the patient is in an immuno-compromised state. Here we considered three patient's who presented with relevant signs and symptoms， frontal headache being the common symptom among the three， and they pre-sented with these signs and symptoms at least two weeks after COVID infection. All three patients were diagnosed with Di-abetes Mellitus with poorly controlled glucose levels. One of the patients was hospitalized during a COVID infection and managed with steroids in the hospital. This could be a con-tributing factor along with uncontrolled glucose levels in this patient. However， all patients were managed both medically and surgically. Liposomal Amphotericin B and Posaconazole is the\n\n【37】pharmacological therapy given to these patients. They arehighly effective and are evident by their outcome. In addition， endo-scopic sinus surgery with frontal craniotomy was performed on this patient. Here it is to be emphasized that pharmacologi-cal and surgical therapies are necessary in complicated cases of frontal osteomyelitis to achieve optimum outcomes. All three patients were monitored for at least three months post-surgery， and the outcome was satisfactory.\n\n【38】According to Marx et al.， a thorough workup of blood glu-cose levels， electrolytes， and blood gases is required if a patient has diabetes(15). Aggressive correction of hyperglycemia and acidemia， along with debridement， is necessary. Medical man-agement with antifungals， injectables， and oral therapy play an important role in prognosis. The overall approach needs to promptly diagnose and treat with all accessible modalities.\n\n【39】Conclusion\n\n【40】A diabetic patient with a history of COVID-19 infection and sinonasal symptoms should alert the clinician to a possible mu-cormycotic infection in the current scenario. Sinonasal variety is the most common type of mucormycosis， so early identification， triaging， and a proper multidisciplinary management approach are imperative. Prompt and aggressive treatment is required to ensure a favourable outcome.\n\n【41】Funding\n\n【42】This work did not receive any grant from funding agencies in the public， commercial， or not-for-profit sectors.\n\n【43】Conflict of interest\n\n【44】There are no conflicts of interest to declare by any of the authors of this study.\n\n【45】References\n\n【46】1\\.

It is known to cause vasculitis involving multiple organs due to its direct toxic effect and by the contribu-tion of levamisole or a combined effect of both.\n\n【24】Case Report： A 51-year-old woman complained of painful erythematous rash in her hands and lower extremities that start-ed few hours after smoking cocaine and progressed to blistering dark lesions in her lower extremities. She de-nied any other systemic complaints. Although she has been smoking cocaine for more than 35 years， these skin eruptions started only 4 years ago. Examination revealed tender retiform purpura in the hand and ten-der retiform purpura with hemorrhagic bulla in the legs. Initially， she had only a significantly positive atypical p-ANCA and later developed combined positivity of both Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and Anti-proteinase-3(PR3) antibodies with a p-ANCA pattern on immunofluorescence. We report a unique case of cocaine (likely contam-\n\n【25】inated with levamisole)-induced delayed recurrent vasculitis with varying vasculitic antibodies over the years.\n\n【26】Conclusions： This case highlights the fact that patients can develop cocaine-related vasculitis after many years of unevent-\n\n【27】ful abuse. Cocaine， with its adulterant levamisole， has the propensity to trigger diverse immunological reac-\n\n【28】tions， which is evident by the varying antibody profile seen in the same patient over time.\n\n【29】MeSH Keywords： Cocaine · Levamisole·Vasculitis\n\n【30】Full-text PDF http：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/893550\n\n【31】口夕11397 2 HL日2串 国1 5\n\n【32】In 2013 the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) estimated that there were 1.549 million current cocaine users in the USA \\[1\\]. Thirty percent of the cocaine seized by the DEA (U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency) from July to September 2008 was found to be adulterated with levamisole， which dramatically increased to 70% by July 2009 \\[2，3\\]. Given the high prevalence of cocaine use and the rising trend of adulteration with levamisole，knowl-edge and awareness of related complications becomes vital for practicing physicians. The toxic effects of cocaine had increased since the adulteration of cocaine with levamisole. Vasculitis due to direct effects of cocaine and its contaminant levamisole has been reported in the literature； however， we report a case of de-layed cocaine-induced vasculitis， with a follow-up of over 4 years， with varying antibodies. This case signifies the potential of co-caine to trigger vasculitis after many years of abuse and the di-verse immunomodulatory properties predicted by the diverse antibody profile during each exacerbation in the same patient.\n\n【33】Case Report\n\n【34】A 51-year-old woman complained of painful erythematous rash that started a few hours after smoking cocaine and progressed\n\n【35】to blistering dark lesions involving her lower extremities and hands. She had similar episodes of skin eruptions in the past that always occurred after cocaine use， but she was not on any long-term treatment. Although she has been smoking co-caine for more than 35 years， these skin eruptions started 4years ago， after which she had similar several skin eruptions after smoking cocaine. Two years ago， she had a severe skin eruption with necrosis， which required skin grafting. Her oth-er medical problems were hepatitis C， for which she neverre-ceived treatment， and she had an excision of melanoma 10years ago. She denied any joint pain， hair loss，oral ulcers， na-sal ulcers， rash on the face， photosensitivity， discoloration of finger tips in cold weather， hemoptysis， or shortness of breath.\n\n【36】Examination revealed tender retiform purpura in the hand(Figure 1) and tender retiform purpura with hemorrhagic bul-Ia in the legs (Figure 2). There were no skin lesions on the other parts of the body. Other system examination was unre-vealing. Her initial laboratory results showed mild hypochro-mic microcytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 10.9 g/dl， with evidence of iron deficiency in the iron panel. The white blood cell count of 4.3 K/ul with a neutrophil count of 2.6 K/ul and platelet count was 212 000. The electrolytes， renal function test， liver function test， and coagulation profile was normal. Urine analysis showed microscopic hematuria with red blood\n\n【37】Figure 1.

There was no evidence of hepatitis B infection and the rapid plasma reagin was nega-tive. She was tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)1 month ago and was found to be negative. The urine toxicol-ogy was positive for cocaine. Levamisole levels were not done. The concerns were cocaine or levamisole-induced vasculitis. ANCA-associated vasculitis， cryoglobulinemic vasculitis related to hepatitis C， and connective tissue disease-related vasculitis.\n\n【42】A vasculitic panel revealed high levels of anti-PR3 antibody and anti-MPO antibody with a p-ANCA pattern. Her cryoglob-ulins were negative. Further autoimmune work-up showed a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) with a titer of 1：80 and homogenous pattern. The rheumatoid factor (RF) and anticar-diolipin IgM antibody were also positive. Anti-Smith antibody， anti-double-stranded DNA antibody (ds DNA antibody)， anti-citrullinated protein antibody (Anti CCP antibody)， anti-ss-A antibody， anti-SSB-antibody， and anticardiolipin IgG were nega-tive. There was decreased C3 with normal C4 levels. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 53 mm/Hr. C-reactive protein was 65.9mg/L (normal range 0-4.9) (Table 1).\n\n【43】We also reviewed the autoimmune work-up and vasculitic work-up from previous admissions and current admission over the last 4 years (Table 2).\n\n【44】In 2010， a vasculitic panel revealed a positive atypical p-AN-CA with negative anti-proteinase 3 antibody (PR3 antibody) and anti-myeloperoxidase antibody (MPO antibody). However， in 2013 the patient had developed anti-PR3 antibody but had negative anti-MPO antibody. ANCA pattern on immunofluo-rescence was not done in 2013. During this presentation in2014， the patient had a very high level of anti-PR3 antibody and went on to develop anti-MPO antibody with a p-ANCA pat-tern. However， she did not demonstrate a c-ANCA pattern. Her skin biopsy revealed vasculitis with fibrin thrombi.\n\n【45】She was treated with steroids during this admission and the skin lesions improved significantly. She was counseled on ces-sation of cocaine to prevent recurrent similar skin lesions.\n\n【46】Discussion\n\n【47】Cocaine is known to cause vasculitis involving multiple organs and has been described in the literature， but still is a rare phe-nomenon. The etiopathogenesis still remains obscure and it is not known only why a subset of cocaine abusers develops vas-culitis. Many patients can present like a typical case of granu-lomatosis with polyangiitis with positive cytoplasmic-staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (c-ANCA) with specificity\n\n| Test  | Normal range  | 2010  | 2013  | 2014  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Anti-nuclear antibody  | <7.5IU/ml  | Positive  | Positive  | Positive  |\n| Anti-cardiolipin IgG  | 0-14 U/ml  | Not done  | Negative  | 11  |\n| Anti-cardiolipin IgM  | 0-12 U/ml  | Not done  | Negative  | 62  |\n| Cryoglobulin  | Negative  | Not done  | Negative  | Negative  |\n| Complement C3  | 90-180 mg/dl  | 64  | 87  | 57  |\n| Complement C4  | 9-36 mg/dl  | 18  | 30  | 18  |\n| Rheumatoid factor  | <13.9IU/ml  | Negative  | Negative  | 20.7  |\n| Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide antibody  | <19U  | Not done  | Not done  | Negative  |\n| Atypical p-ANCA  | <1.20 titer  | 1：640  | Not done  | Negative  |\n| p-ANCA  | <1.20 titer  | Negative  | Not done  | \\>1：640  |\n| C-ANCA  | <1.20 titer  | Negative  | Not done  | Negative  |\n| Anti-proteinase 3 antibody  | <3.5 U/ml  | Negative  | 57  | \\>100  |\n| Anti-myeloperoxidase antibody  | <9 U/ml  | Negative  | Negative  | 23.6  |\n\n【49】Al -antibody index； U - units； IU/ml-international units/milliliter； U/ml- units/milliliter.\n\n【50】for the target antigen proteinase-3(PR-3)\\[4\\]. Chronic intranasal use of cocaine can cause cocaine-induced midline destructive lesions， which may be difficult to differentiate from granulo-matosis with polyangiitis \\[5\\]， but a positive human neutrophil elastase (HNE-ANCA) is more suggestive of cocaine-induced vasculitis \\[5\\]. Cocaine use is also associated with cerebral an-gitis \\[6\\]， scrotal vasculitis \\[7\\]， urticarial vasculitis \\[8\\]， IgA ne-phropathy， and Churg-Strauss vasculitis \\[9\\]. Although many of these cases were ANCA-negative， some patients demonstrated perinuclear ANCA (p-ANCA) with paradoxical specificity to PR3.\n\n【51】Vasculitis in cocaine abuse could be a direct effect of cocaine or due to contamination with levamisole and a combined ef-fect of both. In 2003 levamisole was first detected as a co-caine adulterant and is believed to be added by the manufac-turers for its stimulant properties. Around 70% of the cocaine seized in the United States is adulterated with levamisole \\[2，3\\]. Levamisole is a veterinary anti-helminthic agent that was also used as a therapeutic agent for autoimmune disorders and can-cers due to its immunomodulatory action. It was withdrawn from human use in 1999 due to its adverse effects such as agranulocytosis and cutaneous vasculitis. The first case of le-vamisole-induced vasculitis was reported in 1978 in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis \\[10\\].\n\n【52】ANCA-associated vasculitis could be triggered by a variety of drugs， including hydralazine， propylthiouracil， and minocy-cline. Significantly high titers of anti-MPO antibody are found in these patients and， rarely， dual positivity of both anti-MPO\n\n【53】and anti-PR3 antibodies are found， but is extremely scarce in other conditions. Our patient had combined positivity and sig-nificantly elevated anti-PR3 antibody with a 2-fold increase in anti-MPO antibody. Similar phenomena of dual positivi-ty have been described in a study at Massachusetts General Hospital's ANCA laboratory on cocaine-positive patients； 50%(15/30) of the patients were positive for both of these anti-bodies \\[11\\]. However， these patients demonstrated both p-AN-CA and c-ANCA patten， whereas our patient only demonstrat-ed the p-ANCA patten.\n\n【54】The clinical manifestations of levamisole-induced vasculitis is usually limited to skin with tender purpuric papules with re-ticular pattern， which could progress to skin necrosis com-monly involving the ears， face， and extremities. Levamisole has rarely been associated with pulmonary \\[11，12\\]， and re-nal \\[12，13\\] involvement. Laboratory tests could be positive for various antibodies such as ANCA antibodies， ANA， and lu-pus anticoagulant. Levamisole can also cause agranulocyto-sis \\[14\\]. Skin biopsy shows either a mixed pattern of leukocy-toclastic and thrombotic vasculitis or an isolated thrombotic vasculopathy. Levamisole can be detected in specialized labo-ratories using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectros-copy， but it has a short half-life of 5.6 hours \\[15\\]. Our patient had only skin manifestations involving the extremities， likely secondary to levamisole-contaminated cocaine， with charac-teristic retiform lesions， but the limitation is that levamisole levels were not checked.\n\n【55】Primary management of cocaine-induced vasculitis is absti-nence from cocaine consumption. Steroids have been used in some patients， but further studies are needed on long-term management. Our patient received steroids and showed im-provement in skin lesions. Although vasculitis and causal rela-tionship with cocaine and levamisole has been described， the possibility of delayed vasculitis and varying ANCA antibodies in the same patient over time has not been described in the literature and we report this unique case.\n\n【56】References：\n\n【57】1\\.

Psoas muscle ab-scess arising in patients with Crohn’s disease is un-common， reported to be between 0.4%-4.3%\\[1\\]， but is very rarely the first manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease with only a handful of cases reported in the literature \\[2\\].\n\n【23】CASE REPORT\n\n【24】A 21-year-old male was admitted to the surgical team complaining of a six week history of right lower abdomi-nal pain， malaise and weakness. He had attended the Emergency Department two weeks earlier with right hip pain following exercise， and plain radiographs of the right hip and leg had shown no cause for his pain. He reported significant weight loss from 11 to 7 stone in two years despite a normal appetite， and gave a his-tory of“erratic” bowel habit， with occasional episodes of passing watery stool up to seven times daily.\n\n【25】On examination the patient was thin， pale and unwell. He was afebrile， but was tachycardic and tachypnoeic， with marked tenderness in the right lower quadrant. Urine dipstick was normal and laboratory investigations were as follows： haemoglobin 10.0 g/dL (12.5-18.0)， MCV 68.0 fL (80.0-98.0)， white blood cell count 18.1x10\"/L(4.0-10.5)，platelet count 810 x10/L (145-400)， albumin 29 g/L (35-59)， C-reactive protein 140 mg/L(<10) and iron 3 umol/L (9-30).\n\n【26】Magnetic resonance imaging was performed， and demonstrated a right iliac fossa collection with involvement of the adjacent right psoas muscle. A CT-guided percutaneous drainage was undertaken with an 8-F pigtail catheter. A barium contrast study was undertaken and at this stage reported a normal appearance of small bowel mucosal pattern and lu-\n\n【27】Figure 1. Computed tomography scan undertaken at second admission， demonstrating abscess cavity containing oral contrast and air tracking down anterior aspect of right thigh (arrow).\n\n【28】minal calibre， and specifically no ‘classic'radiological signs of inflammatory bowel disease such as mucosal oedema， strictures， dilatation or abnormal gas in the biliary or urinary collecting systems. The patient de-teriorated， with increasing groin pain， fixed-flexion deformity of the right hip and fever， with rising white cell count and a lactic acidosis. CT scan demonstrated recurrence of the right-sided psoas abscess， with extensive barium and air tracking down the shaft of femur， consistent with bowel perforation (Fig. 1).\n\n【29】Laparotomy revealed a large inflammatory mass at the terminal ileum and caecum with a cavity opening into the right psoas muscle and tracking down the thigh. Pus was aspirated and an ileo-caecal resection with ileostomy and mucus fistula was performed. Two drains were left in situ. Histology demonstrated a full thickness defect of the terminal ileum (perforation)， extensive inflammatory change with widespread mu-cosal ulceration， follicular lymphoid aggregates and non-caseating granulomata， consistent with Crohn’s disease. Post-operative recovery was gradual， with slow improvements in mobility and nutritional intake. The drains were removed nine days after surgery， and the patient was discharged after eighteen days.\n\n【30】DISCUSSION\n\n【31】Psoas muscle abscess is an uncommon disease entity \\[3\\] causing considerable morbidity and mortality. Cases are classified as primary or secondary， depending on the presence of underlying disease. Primary cases commonly occur in association with diabetes mellitus， intravenous drug use， AIDS， renal failure and im-munosuppression. In the developing world， primary psoas abscess is the most common \\[4\\]， exacerbated\n\n【32】D\n\n【33】by\n\n【34】y\n\n【35】1\n\n【36】the ongoing AIDS epidemic. Secondary causes are usually due to infective or inflammatory conditions affecting intra-abdominal structures. The psoas mus-cle lies in close relation to many structures， including jejunum， ileum， colon， appendix， aorta， renal tract， pancreas and spine， and thus infection in any of these can spread to cause involvement of the adjacent psoas muscle. It is thought that the rich vascular supply to the muscle predisposes it to haematogenous spread from sites of occult infection \\[S\\].\n\n【37】The most commonly found pathogen in primary psoas abscess is Staphylococcus aureus， present in over 80%\n\n【38】of patients. Serratia， Pseudomonas，Haemophilus and\n\n【39】Proteus species have also been isolated. Enteric bac-teria are more frequently isolated in secondary psoas\n\n【40】abscess， including Escherichia coli， Streptococcus and\n\n【41】Enterobacter species \\[4\\]. Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n\n【42】is unusual in Western nations， although is more com-mon in the developing world. There is no evidence，\n\n【43】however， that bacteriologic findings per se have any influence on disease natural history or outcome \\[6\\].\n\n【44】Psoas abscess usually has an insidious onset， with non-specific symptoms and signs \\[7\\]. This can account for the often long delay in diagnosis and contribute to the considerable morbidity. Typical features include ab-dominal， groin， flank or back pain， fever， malaise and weight loss， and there may be a palpable mass in the flank or iliac fossa on the affected side \\[8\\]. Due to the muscle innervation from L2， 3， and 4 nerves， pain may be referred to the hip or thigh. The patient may limp and favour a position of comfort lying supine with the hip in moderate flexion with mild external rotation.\n\n【45】Blood tests characteristically show elevated inflam-matory markers， and often anaemia. Raisedurea and pyuria may be present \\[5\\] and blood cultures may re-veal a causative organism. Definitive diagnosis requires radiological imaging. Plain x-rays have little diagnostic value， but may provide evidence of a secondary cause of the psoas abscess. Ultrasound is a safe， inexpensive investigation but is operator dependant and is diag-nostic in only 60-70% of cases \\[4\\]. The ‘gold standard’is computed tomography with sensitivity of 80-100%. Magnetic resonance imaging is an alternative to CT， and some believe it provides clearer discrimination of soft tissues although sensitivity is the same \\[5\\].\n\n【46】Treatment requires a combination of appropriate antimicrobial therapy and drainage of the abscess. Blood cultures results should be used to guide phar-macotherapy. Drainage can be undertaken either by CT-guided percutaneous method or by open surgical intervention and some debate surrounds the best practice. Cantasdemir et al (2003) reported successful CT-guided drainage in 21 of 22 patients， of whom 20cases were primary psoas abscess \\[9\\]. However， sur-gical drainage has been shown to be associated with\n\n【47】REFERENCES：\n\n【48】1\\. Ogihara M， Masaki T， Watanabe T， et al. Psoas abscess complicating Crohn's disease： report of a case.

Jawhariet al(1998) reviewed thirty-six patients with Crohn’s disease related abscesses， in whom percutaneous drainage was technically possible in eight. It failed in four of the cases and gave good long-term results in two， with twenty-eight patients requiring open surgical manage-ment \\[12\\]. It is felt that radiological-guided drainage is effective for primary psoas abscess， but secondary abscess will generally require a more definitive surgi-cal procedure， aiming to drain the abscess and treat the underlying cause \\[13\\[14\\]. However， percutaneous drainage may be used as a less invasive initial procedure to help improve the patient’s condition prior surgery， especially when in combination with treatment to cor-rect nutritional deficiencies \\[15\\].\n\n【63】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【64】Psoas abscess is a well documented complication of Crohn’s disease， although is rarely the presenting fea-ture. It can be in..5sidious and non-specific in presenta-tion， leading to delays in diagnosis and considerable morbidity and mortality. It is essential that clinicians are alert to the possibility of the diagnosis and that an ap-propriate treatment plan is initiated， which may require a multidisciplinary team. All patients require nutritional correction and drainage of the abscess， which is increas-ingly being performed under radiological guidance， although if an underlying cause is known a definitive surgical operation may be more appropriate.\n\n【65】ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\n【66】With many thanks to Mr Simon Middleton， Consultant Surgeon， for assistance in preparing the report.\n\n【67】9\\.

The most common pulmonary manifestation of TSC， occurring almost exclusively in women， is lymphangi-oleiomyomatosis (LAM). In LAM， smooth muscle cells infiltrate various lung structures to form multiple cysts， which usual-ly leads to symptoms such as progressive dyspnea on exer-tion and recurrent pneumothoraces. Other manifestations of TSC in the lung include multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia and clear cell tumor of the lung \\[2-5\\]. Malignant\n\n【36】Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC， Bourneville-Pringle disease) is a multisystem genetic disorder with an incidence of 1 per6800 to 17 300 live births. Worldwide， there are approximately2 million people living with TSC. The syndrome is caused by a mutation in either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene. About 70% of cas-es are secondary to spontaneous mutations； 30% are inherit-ed in an autosomal dominant manner \\[1\\].\n\n【37】Figure 1.

In such cases， there are diagnostic difficulties in distinguishing between metastatic lesions and benign changes. We show the useful-ness of PET in solving these difficulties. The aim of this arti-cle is to present the usefulness of metabolic imaging using18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/com-puted tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) in distinguishing benign from neoplastic lesions in a patient with TSC\n\n【40】Case Report\n\n【41】A 17-year-old female patient with TSC was referred for 18F-FDG PET/CT with suspected lung and bone metastases. The patient and her legal representative signed a written informed consent form to participate in this study. The diagnosis of TSC was made in accordance with clinical criteria， Roach's criteria， and Goetz's\n\n【42】criteria \\[2，3\\]. The patient was not treated with mTOR inhibi-tors. In the course of the disease，the patient underwent a bi-lateral nephrectomy because of multiple cysts and angiomyo-lipomas. A colonoscopy- performed in preparation for kidney transplantation- revealed several colon polyps， one of which was found to be cancerous upon histopathologic examination. A diagnosis of adenocarcinoma G3 was made and a CT scan of the chest and abdomen performed afterwards showed multi-ple pulmonary nodules and sclerotic bone lesions suggestive of metastases. However， 18F-FDG PET/CT (Figure 1) revealed multiple nodules， 7-15 mm in diameter (Figures 2， 3， left col-umns)， and changes typical of LAM (Figure 2， left column) in both lungs. In the bones， we found multiple sclerotic lesions(Figure 4， left column). All of the above findings showed FDG uptake at the level of the background activity， which contra-dicted their metastatic origin. We did not identify lesions in-dicative of metastases in other regions of the body. In followup\n\n【43】Figure 3.

Imaging was conducted using the Advantage Workstation for Diagnostic Imaging (GE； AW4.6\\_05.003\\_SLED\\_11； GIMP 2.10 General Public License).\n\n【44】PET/CT performed 6 months later (Figures 1-4， right columns)， the lesions in the lungs and bones were stable. Again， we found no FDG-avid lesions indicative of malignancy.\n\n【45】Discussion\n\n【46】In the presented case， we show the utility of 18F-FDG PET/CT in discriminating between benign and malignant lesions in a patient with TSC and colorectal cancer. Anatomical imag-ing (CT) proved insufficient in this setting as colorectal cancer metastases and benign TSC lesions may look alike. However， colorectal adenocarcinoma and its metastases generally show high glucose metabolism； this was the rationale for perform-ing PET/CT with the glucose analogue， 18F-FDG， which is rap-idly absorbed and trapped in most cancerous cells， in con-trast to benign lesions where the uptake is low or absent \\[6\\].\n\n【47】In the reported case， PET/CT was performed to identify FDG-avid lesions (suggestive of malignancy) that would be suit-able for biopsy. However， both the pulmonary and the bone lesions showed minimal tracer uptake. This led to the con-clusion that all of them were of TSC origin. Followup PET/CT showed a lack of lesion progression {which would be the nat-ural course for malignancy) and hence supported the benign character of the findings.\n\n【48】TSC has many clinical manifestations and potential complica-tions. For this reason， a group of doctors composed of pedia-tricians， neurologists， surgeons， radiologists， and nuclear med-icine doctors is involved in the treatment of TSC patients in our Centre. The use of such a multidisciplinary team has been shown to be beneficial in treating TSC by other authors \\[7，8\\].\n\n【49】Figure 4.

Yellow arrows indicate sclerotic lesions in the body of the L3 vertebra， with no FDG uptake. The lesions did not progress in the time between the 2 scans. Imaging was conducted using the Advantage Workstation for Diagnostic Imaging (GE； AW4.6\\_05.003\\_SLED\\_11； GIMP 2.10 General Public License).\n\n【50】We believe that metabolic imaging such as 18F-FDG PET/CT might be helpful in discriminating benign from malignant le-sions in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex.\n\n【51】References：\n\n【52】1\\.

In 2022-23， this journal achieved an impact factor (IF) of 1.2. The significant merits of published case re-ports include identifying rare diseases and syndromes， treatment complications or side effects， pharmacovigi-lance， and medical education. The limitations or cautions of the case report include the inability to generalize， the lack of establishment of a cause-effect relationship， and over-interpretation. Historically， new clinical con-ditions and syndromes have been identified. Since 2020， the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted manuscript submissions and publications， as illustrated for this journal. This editorial aims to highlight the im-portance of case reports and series， recent publication trends and includes recommendations on what to do and what not to do when preparing and writing the manuscript for a case report.\n\n【13】Keywords： Case Report · Case Series ·Clinical Practice · Medical Education·Editorial\n\n【14】PubMed is a publicly available search facility for more than36 million citations in the biomedical literature， mainly from MEDLINE， the National Library of Medicine (NLM) journal cita-tion database \\[1，2\\]. Figure 1 shows the ten-year trend in sub-missions to and publications in the American Journal of Case Reports between 2012 and 2022. A search of PubMed be-tween 2012 and 2022 shows that the American journal of Case Reports (Am J Case Rep) published more than 3，500 case re ports and case series， including 476 publications in 2022 alone(Figure 1) \\[1，3\\]. For the first time， in 2022-23， the American joumal of Case Reports achieved an impact factor (IF) of 1.2 \\[3\\]. These data highlight some important facts about the current status of publications of case reports in the medical litera-ture， which are that the number of publications continues to increase and that the clinical importance of case reports and the journals that publish them may have been undervalued \\[4\\].\n\n【15】The presentation of the case of a patient， including the histo-ry， diagnosis， management， and any novel aspects， is a fun-damental part of medical education before and after medical qualification， which continues throughout the clinical ca-reer \\[4，5\\]. However， opinions still vary on the relevance of pub-lishing case reports and case series to medical education and practice \\[4，5\\]. There is the view that they are of limited value at a time when medical research， drug development， and the results of clinical trials dominate the medical literature \\[4，5\\]. However， evidence also supports that they are undervalued and remain relevant \\[6\\]. In the last 15 years， the number of journals that publish case reports has increased rapidly， in line\n\n【16】with the increase in open-access publications \\[5\\]. Currently， more than 200 journals indexed in MEDLINE and identified on PubMed publish case reports and case series \\[2\\]. At this time， the NLM Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus search terms， ‘case report' and 'case series， identify a total of2，417，365 case reports and 170，445 case series published in journals indexed in MEDLINE and identified on PubMed \\[2，7\\]. In 2022 alone， there were 77，800 published case reports and more than 15，000 published case series \\[2\\].\n\n【17】The history of medicine has shown some important landmark case reports identifying medical conditions， which may have un-dergone delayed recognition without these publications. Also， single case reports and case series have driven future observa-tional and experimental clinical studies. For example， as early as 1869， Beard published the first description of 'neurasthenia'in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal \\[8\\]. The condition of neurasthenia was later identified as myalgic encephalomyelitis(ME) or chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). In February 1915，dur-ing World War l， Captain Charles Myers， a British military doc-tor， first identified and described the syndrome of shell shock in a publication in the Lancet \\[9\\]. Before this publication， sol-diers with shell shock were assumed to be either malingerers or cowards. In 1949， a chance observation reported the asso-ciation between lithium and the control of mania in patients with manic-depressive disorder \\[10\\]. The side effect of congen-ital abnormalities in infants born to mothers who took the an-ti-emetic drug thalidomide in the 1950s and 1960s was first reported in 1961 as a Letter to the Editor in the Lancet \\[11\\].\n\n【18】Figure 1.

More recently， in 2008， a case series published in the New England Journal of Medicine identified the beneficial effects of systemic propran-olol on the treatment of infantile hemangioma \\[13\\]. Therefore， case reports and case series can be expected to continue with their essential contributions to the medical literature， medical education， clinical practice， and patient safety \\[14\\].\n\n【23】Since 2020， the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the number of manuscript submissions and publications \\[15\\].\n\n【24】Initial reports were of the symptoms， presentation， and out-comes of SARS-CoV-2 infections， which then described the long-term effects of COVID-19 and responses to new treat-ments and vaccines \\[15\\]. Concerns have been expressed that this sudden rush to submit case reports on COVID-19 result-ed in a rapid increase in manuscript submissions that was not matched by the number of publications due to reduced manu-script quality \\[15\\]. Between January 2020 and September 2023， PubMed identified approximately 20，000 published case re-ports and more than 5，000 case series involving COVID-19 \\[2\\]. The recent effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on manuscript\n\n【25】submissions and publications by the American Joumal ofCase Reports are also shown in Figure 1. The data in Figure 1 sup-port the rapid increase in publications of case reports by this journal during the COVID-19 pandemic but also show a much greater 'spike'in journal submissions. Between 2020 and 2022， the peer review process identified case reports that fulfilled current publishing guidelines and the criteria for reporting clin-ical cases (Tables 1 and 2).\n\n【26】Table 1 summarizes the things to do and what not to do when preparing a manuscript as a case report， including the ethical requirements and preparation of the supporting clinical ma-terial. Table 2 summarizes the essential things to do and in-clude and what not to do or include when writing the case re-port. Case reports should be reported ethically and credibly， with attention to the manuscript content， patient informed consent for publication and respect for patient confidential-ity and anonymity. (Tables 1 and 2). All journals that publish case reports and case series， including the American journal of Case Reports， publish guidelines or instructions for authors on preparing the manuscript， which should be followed \\[16\\]. Also， the CAse REport (CARE) Statement and Checklist provide clear recommendations for what to include in case reports \\[17，18\\]. The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE)(www.icmje.org) provides standardized guidelines for the eth-ical requirements， preparation， and formatting of all manu-scripts submitted for publication， including case reports \\[19\\].\n\n【27】Case reports are often the first publications for medical and surgical trainees at the start of their careers \\[20\\].Some medical schools provide training in writing formal case reports as part of the clinical curriculum， often as part of the clinical patholo-gy or laboratory medicine program， supported with guidance from clinical tutors \\[20，21\\]. In January 2023， Gupta and col-leagues highlighted the importance of writing and publishing\n\n【28】case reports by medical trainees and clarified the requirements for time， training， and mentorship \\[22\\]. These authors and medical educators designed and used a synchronous， virtual workshop that included trainees and academic faculty from several medical schools \\[22\\]. Trainees and clinical mentors dis cussed the contributions of case reports to the medical litera-ture， identified the key content required， and the features of interesting and informative case reports \\[22\\]. Two months af-ter the workshop， medical trainees gained confidence in iden-tifying clinical cases with rare presentations and rare cases of interest， working with clinical mentors， and writing case re-ports with mentorship \\[22\\].\n\n【29】The major merits of published case reporting include identifying rare diseases and syndromes and complications or side effects of treatment， pharmacovigilance， and clinical education \\[4\\]. The limitations or cautions of the case report include the inability to generalize， the lack of establishment of a cause-effect re-lationship， the dangers of over-interpretation， and the pursuit of the rare or unusual case (the 'first case') rather than the in-formative or educational case \\[4\\]. Attempts have been made to revise the case report genre and to integrate the medical report with a narrative approach \\[23\\]. However， the narrative case report， or patient's story， has met with limited success， possibly because of the difficulty in identifying content rele-vant to the clinical case， ethical concerns， and concerns with patient anonymity \\[23\\].\n\n【30】Conclusions\n\n【31】The future of the case report and case series remains assured as new diseases， syndromes， and treatments and their appli-cations and side effects constantly evolve and require early and clear reporting in the medical literature.\n\n【32】References：\n\n【33】1\\.

The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies can res ult in a variety of clinical symptoms， such as thrombocytopenia， stillbirth， endocardial pathologies， and recurrent pulmonary embolism.\n\n【17】Case Report：\n\n【18】Conclusions：\n\n【19】We present the case of a 23-year-old man with antiphospholipid syndrome and chronic thromboembolic pul-monary hypertension who developed severe thrombocytopenia. The patient died from right heart failure before the thrombocytopenia could be managed， preventing performance of a pulmonary endarterectomy procedure. Managing platelet counts in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome prior to major surgery is very problematic， and requires similar treatment strategy as in patients with immune thrombocytic thrombocytopenia. Platelet transfusions may further decrease platelet count， as it can trigger formation of new antibodies.\n\n【20】MeSH Keywords： Antiphospholipid Syndrome · Hypertension， Pulmonary· Purpura， Thrombocytopenic， Idiopathic\n\n【21】Abbreviations：\n\n【22】aPL-antiphospholipid antibodies； APS - antiphospholipid syndrome； CTEPH -chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension； ITP -immune thrombocytopenic purpura； PEA - pulmonary thromboendarter-ectomy； PAWP-pulmonary artery wedge pressure\n\n【23】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/909778\n\n【24】口1369 十2 HL ￥19\n\n【25】Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by a hypercoagulable state associated with cir-culating antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL)\\[1\\]. The presence of aPL can result in variety of clinical symptoms， such as throm-bocytopenia， stillbirth， endocardial pathologies， and recurrent pulmonary embolism. Thrombocytopenia can be present in as many as 23.4% of APS cases \\[2\\].\n\n【26】Antiphospholipid antibodies are commonly found in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)， but the clinical significance is still controversial \\[3\\].\n\n【27】Mechanisms of thrombocytopenia associated with APS can vary. It can occur due to immune-mediated clearance of platelets， as seen in ITP patients， or less frequently as a consequence of interaction between aPL and platelets triggering aggrega-tion and thrombosis \\[4\\].\n\n【28】Due to similar pathogenetic mechanisms， patients with both aPL and thrombocytopenia are treated as ITP. The preferred first-line treatment is oral prednisone 1-2 mg/kg/day， but it is possible to use higher and lower doses of prednisone or methylprednisolone. Patients who are unresponsive or in-tolerant to glucocorticoids can be treated with immunosup-pressive drugs such as azathioprine and cyclophosphamide. Intravenous immunoglobulin is used in patients with life-threatening bleeding or to rapidly increase platelet counts. Rituximab， which has been used off-label in ITP patients， has also proven itself to be effective in APS-associated thrombo-cytopenia \\[5\\]. Splenectomy should be postponed for as long as possible， and done only for patients who are unresponsive to glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants.\n\n【29】Antiphospholipid syndrome may result in various clinical syn-dromes， and CTEPH is one of them \\[6\\]. Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension is classified as group 4 pulmonary hypertension caused by chronic thromboembolic obstruction and clinically manifests as exercise intolerance， fatigue， and progressive dyspnea on exertion \\[7\\]. Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension stands out from other types of pul-monary hypertension because it is curable by pulmonary end-arterectomy (PEA) \\[8\\]. Pulmonary endarterectomy requires a median sternotomy， cardiopulmonary bypass， and periods of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Twenty-minute periods of hypothermic circulatory arrest ensures a bloodless surgical field. It is done in expert centers only， as the procedure is very complex. Studies have shown that quality of life and life ex-pectancy increase for a majority of patients after PEA \\[9，10\\].\n\n【30】Table 1.

He had been diagnosed with APS in October2007 (Table 1) when he was hospitalized due to a pulmonary embolism， and was on therapy with vitamin K antagonist and regular INR monitoring since. The patient had had another pul-monary embolism in 2012. In concomitant therapy， the patient received bisoprolol 10 mg PO daily， torsemide 10 mg PO daily， and spironolactone 50 mg PO daily.\n\n【34】Laboratory results revealed thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 89x10/L and INR of 2.0. The patient’s liver enzymes were slightly elevated - ALT was 68 U/L and AST 46 U/L. There were no signs of impaired kidney function. Echocardiography revealed significant right heart dilatation and overload with tricuspid valve regurgitation (grade II-II1)， mild pericardial ef-fusion， and severe pulmonary hypertension (right ventricular systolic press ure of 70 mmHg) with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45%. Estimated central venous pressure (CVP) was19 mmHg.\n\n【35】Computed tomography angiography of the chest showed chronic bilateral thromboemboli of pulmonary artery branches， and fresh thromboemboli of the right pulmonary artery， including total occlusion of the right upper-lobe artery.\n\n【36】On January 5h， 2015， the patient underwent right heart cath-eterization， which confirmed the diagnosis of CTEPH (Table 2).\n\n【37】The patient was started on ambrisentan 5 mg PO on January 6h，2015. Ambrisentan was chosen instead of riociguat because it is state-compensated in Latvia. A team of pulmonary hypertension specialists from PSCUH and Vienna General Hospital decided that the patient should undergo evaluation regarding eligibility for PEA. Therefore， the patient was admitted to Vienna General Hospital on May 2015.On admission， pitting peripheral edema and hepatomegaly were noted. The patient was cyanotic and\n\n| Parameter  | Date  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Parameter  | 5.01.2015  |\n| PASP，mmHg  | 88  |\n| PADP，mmHg  | 40  |\n| mPAP，mmHg  | 57  |\n| CO，l/min  | 3.30  |\n| Cl，l/min/m²  | 1.93  |\n| PVR， Wood units  | 10  |\n| PAWP，mmHg  | 23  |\n\n【39】Cl - cardiac index； CO - cardiac output； mPAP-mean pulmonary artery pressure； PADP-pulmonary arterial diastolic pressure； PASP-pulmonary arterial systolic pressure； PAWP-pulmonary arterial wedge pressure； PVR-pulmonary vascular resistance.\n\n【40】had severe dyspnea. Central venous pressure was estimated at 21 mmHg. The patient's platelet count was 43x10/L and he was given 1 bag of platelets on May 16h and started on enoxa-parin 40 mg SC. Anti-nuclear antibodies， anti-nuclear neutrophil antibodies， rheumatoid factor， and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies were negative. The patient was prescribed 75 mg of prednisone PO daily on May 18h. Because the platelet count further deteriorated (24x10°/L)， heparin-induced thrombocy-topenia was suspected， but antibodies against platelet fac-tor 4 were negative. Treatment with eltrombopag 50 mg PO daily was started on May 22md， 2015. Eltrombopag is a small-molecule agonist of the c-mpl receptor， a physiological target of thrombopoietin， and is used to treat ITP that is unrespon-sive to corticosteroids， immunoglobulins， or splenectomy \\[11\\].\n\n【41】Platelet count on June 3r， 2015 was 2x10/L Due to the increas-ing inability to oxygenate， the patient was intubated. The pa-tient died on the following day from severe right-heart failure.\n\n【42】An autopsy was done shortly after death and the pathology report confirmed right ventricular hypertrophy with cor pul-monale. There was complete thrombotic occlusion of the right pulmonary artery and several occlusions in peripheral pulmo-nary artery segments in the left lung. Bone marrow was nor-mocellular. Liver congestion Il and pulmonary congestion with edema were present.\n\n【43】Discussion\n\n【44】The management of the patient was highly complicated due to numerous comorbidities- CTEPH， APS causing progressive thrombocytopenia，and possible concomitant and previously un-diagnosed left-heart disease with congestion in lungs and liver.\n\n【45】In cases like this， it is hard to outline any treatment strategy as the correct or the best one.\n\n【46】The possible dysfunction of the left ventricle is suggested by the decreased ejection fraction， notably increased pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PCWP) of 23 mmHg (pre-capillary pul-monary hypertension is characterized by PCWP of <15 mmHg)， and the autopsy results \\[7\\].\n\n【47】The recommended INR for patients with APS is 2.0-3.0 \\[12\\]. However， for patients with CTEPH， it should be in the target range of 2.5-3.5， with preferably higher INR in cases of under-lying thrombophilia such as APS \\[7\\]. This suggests that the an-ticoagulation therapy was most likely not adequate from 2007to 2015， when the patient received a vitamin K antagonist.\n\n【48】Pulmonary endarterectomy is the treatment of choice for op-erable CTEPH \\[8\\]. Pre-operative risk stratification is essential， with hemorrhagic risk being one of the top priorities. In our case， the patient’s platelet count before the planned surgery was 43x10/L， which is below the recommended threshold for major surgery of 50x10°/L\\[13\\].Usually， patients with APS have mild thrombocytopenia (>50x10/L) that does not require any special management \\[5\\]. There are reports on splenectomy to manage thrombocytopenia in patients with APS in cases where other treatment fails to control platelet counts \\[14-16\\]. In this case， splenectomy would be a questionable choice as the pa-tient had severe heart failure and was in a critical state.\n\n【49】Because thrombocytopenia in APS patients is similar to ITP， the treatment remains the same， with glucocorticoids strongly recom-mended as first-line treatment \\[5，17\\]. Patients initially unrespon-sive to glucocorticoids should be receiving immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine or cyclophosphamide \\[1\\] orimmuno-modulating agents and intravenous immunoglobulins \\[5，17，18\\].\n\n【50】The use of eltrombopag has proven to be highly effective in patients with ITP. Up to 88.8% of the patients achieve platelet response \\[19\\].\n\n【51】Although antiplatelet antibodies were not determined in this case， the available data showing negative antibodies against platelet factor 4 and normocellular bone marrow and no other relevant findings in autopsy， rule out other possible causes of thrombocytopenia in APS， such as heparin-induced thrombo-cytopenia， thrombotic microangiopathy， bone marrow necrosis， and hemophagocytic syndrome \\[5\\].\n\n【52】It is debatable whether other treatment options， such as im-munosuppressants， immunoglobulins， or even splenectomy， would have changed the outcome of this case， but it has high educational value and raises awareness of various issues en-countered when treating patients with APS.\n\n【53】Antiphospholipid syndrome presenting with severe thrombocy-topenia still remains a challenge， which requires an individual approach and planned treatment strategy， preceded by thor-ough patient work-up. All treatment options at hand need to be weighed and managed by an experienced， multidisciplinary team of pulmonologists， hematologists， and surgeons. Since there are no treatment guidelines for thrombocytopenia in APS， more studies are needed to understand the pathogenesis， clin-ical associations， and management of this condition.\n\n【54】References：\n\n【55】1\\.

Early antenatal care， prompt clinical risk assessment &timely detection， and appropriate intervention play a major role in preventing fatality. A major part of India resides in rural areas where health care facilities & high calibre human resources are limited. Hence healthcare workers must have adequate knowledge and an appropriate attitude towards managing such cases as they are essential healthcare providers in rural areas of India. The study aims to assess the Knowledge， Attitude & Practice of trainee doctors and nurses regarding HDP at a tertiary care centre in Uttar Pradesh， India. Materials & Method： It was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted at a tertiary care centre in Uttar Pradesh， India， from January 2021 to December 2021， in the department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology， where 100 trainee doctors and 60 nurses were included. A face-to-face interview was conducted by a consultant using a pretested questionnaire. The assessment was done by using a modified scoring system. Result： Our study showed that 72.2% of trainee doctors & 63.7% of nurses had satisfactory knowledge regarding hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Best practices were followed by 62.1% of trainee doctors & 54.4% of nurses. In comparison，77.6% of trainee doctors & 82.3% of nurses showed a positive attitude towards HDP. Conclusion： our study shows the gap between doctors and nurses knowledge， attitude and practices towards HDP. These results show the need for improvement in knowledge and the implantation of knowledge in practice. There is scope for improvement in both groups， as shown by the high positive attitude in the result. The study finds that periodic assessment of health workers， training and skill development is required to address gaps and develop tailor-made modules to build upon their strengths so that the burden of the disease can be decreased.\n\n【7】KEYWORDS Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP)， Knowledge Attitude and Practice (KAP)， developing country， trainee doctors， nurses， India\n\n【8】Copyright @ 2022 by the Bulgarian Association of Young Surgeons\n\n【9】DOI： 10.5455/IJMRCR.172-1662152789\n\n【10】First Received： September 4， 2022Accepted： September 20，2022\n\n【11】Associate Editor： Ivan Inkov (BG)；\n\n【12】Corresponding author： Dr Lavanya Anuranjani.

It is a broad term for a common multisystem disorder occurring during pregnancy. It is responsible for the major bulk of the burden of disease in developing & underdeveloped countries. Globally， HDP is responsible for complicating approx. 5-10% of pregnancies \\[1，21. The risk of mortality due to preeclampsia or eclampsia is about 300 times； that of a woman in an underdeveloped country than in developed countries 1\\].\n\n【17】In a developing country like India， skilled human resource constraints due to its large population significantly contribute to the global burden of maternal mortality， as it is responsible for 17 % of all maternal deaths \\[3\\]. According to The National Eclampsia Registry of India (NER 2013) incidence of HDP was10.3%. The incidence of Eclampsia is 1.9%， but maternal mor-tality due to it is 4-6% \\[1\\]. It should be noted that the incidence may be higher as many cases remain unreported in India due to the rural setup.\n\n【18】As per ACOG Taskforce； there are four types of HDPs，namely(a) Gestational hypertension； (b) Pre-eclampsia and Eclamp-sia syndrome； (c) Chronic hypertension of any aetiology (d) Preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension \\[4\\]\n\n【19】Preeclampsia complicates 2-8% of pregnancies worldwide \\[5\\]； Eclampsia incidence is low but has the severest manifestations among all HDPs. On the other hand， the incidence of Chronic hypertension in pregnancy is just 0.9-1.5%\\[6\\].\n\n【20】HDP can result in varied maternal complications like hep-atic & renal dysfunctions， cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases， placental abruption， disseminated intravascular coagu-lation (DIC) and HELLP syndrome \\[7\\]. Moreover， the complica-tions don’t end in the antenatal period， as the risk of maternal mortality & morbidity is present in the postpartum period &later life \\[8，9\\].\n\n【21】As far as perinatal outcomes are concerned； complications like preterm delivery， low birth weight， fetal growth restric-tion， fetal distress， intrauterine fetal demise， stillbirth， neonatal asphyxia， and perinatal and neonatal mortality are to name a few10，11，12\\].\n\n【22】Seeing the seriousness & spectrum of complications HDP presents， it has been significant concern over the last few decades. Still， its true aetiology and pathophysiology remain unknown. Research has shown that HDP is characterized by poor placental perfusion and may affect multiple organ systems. In addition， ab-normal interaction between fetal trophoblast， maternal decidua& cells of the maternal immune system results in inadequate placental invasion and maternal vascular remodelling.\n\n【23】Due to its unpredictable nature and poor prognosis， the best option is early detection & prompt treatment， which increases the recovery rate and significantly decreases morbidity and mor-tality， as shown by several studies.\n\n【24】One of the strategies to reduce maternal complications from HDP is to improve the quality of preventive care， which involves better knowledge of the pathophysiology of HDP.\n\n【25】As per a report from South Africa into maternal mortality causes， it was found that among the contributing factors， not assessing patients properly， failure to recognize the problem， delays in referral， not following standard protocols， and poor monitoring were the main issues \\[13\\].\n\n【26】In another study on student midwives in a simulated set-ting， it was found that as the patient deteriorated with marked changes in vitals； the key observations of the student midwives decreased \\[15\\]. These show a deficit of knowledge， assessment， diagnosis and management of HDP on parts of Health Care Workers (HCWs). Studies on Intensive educational programmes for HCWs showed improvement in their KAP \\[7\\].\n\n【27】Developing nations like India face challenges not only on the logistic front but also due to various myths and misconceptions related to pregnant. In addition， low Low socioeconomic status， poor health-seeking behaviour， lack of easily accessible health care facilities， lack of multidisciplinary approach & expert an-tenatal care， scarcity of high dependency units (HDU)， sparse\n\n【28】funds， poor transport facilities and lack of appropriately trained staff contribute to the burden of complications.\n\n【29】Thus， there is a need to recognize and manage HDP and its complications at grass root levels with qualified health care pro-fessionals. Young HCWs， like trainee doctors & nurses， must have adequate knowledge， a positive attitude & best practices to assess， diagnose， manage & follow up on HDP efficiently and effectively. They are the most available cadre of health work-ers & are well positioned for early detection and initiation of care. Task-sharing is important in countries like India， where the doctor-patient ratio is skewed. The quality of care provided by them is dependent on the level of knowledge and skills they pos-sess. Identifying various gaps & their improvement is needed for better functioning of HCWs. It will keep infant and maternal morbidity and mortality rates to a minimum & help in achieving Millennium Development Goal.\n\n【30】However， there is limited research regarding HCWs'knowl-edge， ability and confidence in managing pregnancy compli-cations. Most studies are on pre-eclampsia and eclampsia， as-sessing the causative factors， prevention and treatment without much attention to the important role of health providers & that too in India. Hence this study aimed to describe the current state of KAP regarding HDP among trainee doctors & nurses in a tertiary care centre in north India. The findings of this study can help in identifying gaps & planning focused training sessions to build upon their strengths.\n\n【31】Material and Method\n\n【32】The study was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted at a tertiary care institute in Uttar Pradesh， India， from January 2021to December 2021 in the department of Obstetrics and Gynaecol-ogy. This medical centre caters mostly to rural and semi-urban populations. The participants were active health personnel work-ing in the department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. The total number of the study participants was 160， including 100 trainee doctors and 60 nursing staff with experience of up to 5 years. Purposive sampling was done， and all the trainee doctors &staff available during that period were included in the study. After clearance from the ethical committee， the participants were approached & survey was conducted after informed consent. Pretested questionnaires were formulated after getting approved by consultants. A pilot study was conducted with 10% of health care personnel to assess the validity & reliability of the ques-tionnaire. The pilot study participants were not included in the main study. The participants had the right to withdraw from the study anytime. Confidentiality and anonymity were assured. The questionnaire was self-administered. It contained 2 sections. The first section was used to collect demographic data such as age， sex， qualification， experience & any in-service training received.\n\n【33】The second section consisted of 54 questions divided into three sections dealing with the knowledge， attitude and prac-tice of trainee doctors & nurses toward HDP. Questionnaire contained MCQs & Likert scale questions.\n\n【34】The knowledge section was composed of 22 questions to test basic medical knowledge regarding HDP， definitions， classifi-cation of HDP， trimester affected by Gestational Hypertension， etiology， symptoms & signs， diagnostic tests， organs affected， and alarming signs of feto-maternal complications， management& prevention of HDP etc.\n\n【35】The practice section included 16 questions designed to test the competence of doctors and nurses in the skills of measur-\n\n【36】ing blood pressure， the practice of detailed history taking， pro-teinuria checking by dipstick， management of a patient， fetal monitoring， awareness of the existing WHO guidelines for the management， drugs used & their dosage， the regime used for magnesium sulphate for management， monitoring & signs of magnesium sulphate toxicity & its antidote， when termination of pregnancy is done， practices of health education & counselling， regularity of eclampsia drills etc.\n\n【37】The attitude part included 16 questions that measured the attitudes of participants towards the commonness， risk & seri-ousness of hypertension in pregnancy， confidence in measur-ing blood pressure， the preventability of eclampsia， duty of the patient & doctor in prevention，comfortability in managing pre-eclampsia/eclampsia cases alone， need for counselling of relatives， motivation to improve their knowledge on the subject etc.\n\n【38】The questionnaire had a reliability index of 0.72 Cronbach's Alpha. Data collection was manual. Both knowledge and prac-tice areas were scored where each correct answer was given 1score and wrong， or no answer was given 0 mark. A five-point Likert scaling system was used for scoring Attitude questions. In this scale， a high attitude was assigned if the answer was “agree\"or\"strongly agree\"& a low attitude level for \"Not Sure\" or\"Dis-agree\" or \"strongly disagree\". The maximum score obtainable was 70， while the minimum score was 0. The final scoring of the knowledge and practice section was considered satisfactory if the participant scored at least 60% of the total marks in each sec-tion which is an arbitrary cut-off point based on the pilot study& experts' opinions. Regarding attitude， the questionnaire was handed over to 3 postgraduate doctors. Their responses to atti-tude questions were used as a reference standard. Scores of 19-32were high attitude， while 0-18 score was low attitude. Data entry， processing and analysis were done using SPSS statistical pack-ages. The data collected from the respondents were analysed& processed using various statistical methods like percentages， standard deviation， F-test (Analysis of Variance) and Chi-square. p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n【39】Results\n\n【40】A total of 160 health personnel were included in the study； 100(62.5%) were trainee doctors， and 60 (37.5%) were nurses. Out of 160 health personnel， 157 had completed the questionnaire， whereas 3 health personnel did not complete the questionnaire. Hence participation rate was 98.12% where 98 (98%) were trainee doctor & 59 (98.3%) were nurses (Fig 1). We had 91 (57.96%) female & 66 (42%) male respondents. Among the nurses， all were female & were having up to 5 years of experience. 41(69.49%) were diploma holders， and 18(30.5%) were degree holders.\n\n【41】Knowledge\n\n【42】Our study showed that 131 (83.43%) respondents correctly de-fined HDP. 92 (93.87%) trainee doctors & 39 (66.10%) nurses defined the HDP as systolic arterial pressure (SAP) ≥ 140mmHg and/or diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) ≥ 90 mmHg.112(71.3%) of participants defined gestational hypertension as hy-pertension without proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation， out of which 86 (87.75%) were trainee doctors & 26 (44%) were nurses. Preeclampsia was correctly defined by 142 (90.4%) re-spondents involving 91(92.8%) trainee doctors & 51 (86%)nurses. Our results showed that 149 (94.9%) participants could define eclampsia. Pedal oedema was considered the main sign of pre-eclampsia by 148 (94.26%) participants. 92 (93.87) trainee doctors\n\n【43】Participants\n\n【44】Figure 1 Participants in the study.\n\n【45】& 56 (94.91%) nurses considered pedal oedema related to the disease's severity. In our study， the commonest maternal compli-cation stated was convulsions with 96% of trainee doctors & 95%of nurses. While most common fetal complication was IUGR， with 90(91.8%) trainee doctors & 53 (89.8%) nurses stating it.93% of respondents stated urine analysis is an important investi-gation for detecting pre-eclampsia. Table 1 shows the findings of our study concerning the Knowledge domain of HDP.\n\n【46】As per our study， 72.2% of trainee doctors & 63.7% of nurses had satisfactory knowledge (>60%) regarding hypertensive dis-orders of pregnancy.\n\n【47】Practices\n\n【48】In our study， 64.2% of trainee doctors & 77.9% of nurses checked every pregnant female's blood pressure， making 66% of health care workers. The conditions for measuring blood pressure，like resting in a quiet place for some moment， sitting position with arm located at heart level， appropriately sized cuff (correspond-ing to 1.5 times the arm’s circumference) etc.， were followed by 60.5% in practice. 150 (95.54%) participants had practice counselling regarding HDP. 137 (87.26%) personnel informed regarding medications before starting treatment & monitoring where 43 (72.88%) were nurses & 94 (95.91%) trainee doctors.84% of trainee doctors & 78% of nurses were correctly able to state Labetalol as the antihypertensive drug of choice. 81% of respondents followed the Pitchard regime for MgSo4 & were correctly able to state the dosage. 82% were monitored regarding signs of MgSo4 toxicity during administration. Table 2 shows findings regarding practice.\n\n【49】As per our study， 62.1% of trainee doctors & 54.4% of nurses followed best practices for HDP management.\n\n【50】Attitude\n\n【51】In our study， all participants considered HDP to be a high-risk condition. If hypertension was detected， they encouraged rest& decreased salt intake. 89 (56.68%) respondents believed that eclamptic seizure is hereditary transmitted； of which 58 (59.18%) were trainee doctors & 31(52.54%) nurses stated that the new-born will be at risk of epilepsy. Respondents stated psychologi-cal causes like stress or fear， carelessness on the part of women and their families， and misuse of medications as contributors to HDP. 91(57.96%) health care workers did not want to deal independently with HDP cases when signs of severity appeared.\n\n【52】Table 1 Knowledge about HDP(N=157).\n\n| Sr.No.  | Questions  | Correct responses byTrainee doctors n(%)  | Correct responses byNurses n (%)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | Definition of hypertension in pregnancy  | 92(93.87)  | 39(66.1)  |\n| 2  | Definition of gestational hypertension  | 86(87.75)  | 26(44)  |\n| 3  | Definition of pre- eclampsia  | 91(92.8)  | 51(86)  |\n| 4  | Definition of chronic hypertension  | 67(68.3)  | 28(47.4)  |\n| 5  | Definition of eclampsia  | 95(96.9)  | 54(91.5)  |\n| 6  | Blood pressure measurement is important in every ANC visit  | 96(97.9)  | 56(94.9)  |\n| 7  | Definition of proteinuria  | 61(62.2)  | 31(52.5)  |\n| 8  | Major risk factor  | 76(77.5)  | 36(61)  |\n| 9  | Maternal complications  | 66(67.3)  | 35(59.3)  |\n| 10  | Foetal complications  | 72(73.4)  | 38(64.4)  |\n| 11  | Symptoms of pre-eclampsia  | 93(94.8)  | 35(59.3)  |\n| 12  | Increased Sr. uric acid level is investigation for diagnosing pre-eclampsia  | 93(94.8)  | 54(91.5)  |\n| 13  | Magnesium sulphate dosage  | 97(98.9)  | 57(96.6)  |\n| 14  | Prevention  | 86(87.7)  | 38(64.4)  |\n| 15  | Fundoscopy should be done in chronic Hypertension cases  | 83(84.6)  | 47(79.9)  |\n\n【54】Table 2 Practices related to HDP(N=157).\n\n| Sr.No.  | Questions  | Trainee doctors n (%)  | Nurses n(%)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | Following blood pressure measurement conditions  | 59(60.2)  | 36(61)  |\n| 2  | Themselves Measuring Blood pressure of every pregnant female visiting  | 63(64.2)  | 41(69.4)  |\n| 3  | Do you check urine for proteins?  | 84(85.7)  | 42(71.1)  |\n| 4  | Do you start treatment at Bp 160/110 yourself.  | 54(55.1)  | 26(44)  |\n| 5  | Antihypertensive Drug of choice： labetalol  | 79(80.6)  | 43(72.8)  |\n| 6  | Monitoring for MgSo4 toxicity  | 92(93.8)  | 37(62.7)  |\n|  | Counselling regarding antihypertensive medication  | 87(88.7)  | 43(72.8)  |\n| 8  | Prophylactic use of low dose aspirin & calcium  | 66(67.3)  | 33(55.9)  |\n| 9  | Recommending regular ANC visits  | 90(91.8)  | 55(93.2)  |\n| 10  | Assessment of oedema in pregnant women with hypertension  | 92(93.8)  | 50(84.7)  |\n| 11  | Regularly attending eclampsia drills  | 52(53)  | 25(42.3)  |\n\n【56】Table 3 Attitude towards HDP (N=157).\n\n| Sr.No.  | Questions  | Trainee doctors positiveattitude n(%)  | Nurses positive attituden(%)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | HDP is serious disease in pregnancy  | 98(100)  | 59(100)  |\n| 2  | Confident in measuring blood pressure  | 96(97.9)  | 58(98.3)  |\n| 3  | I should educate pregnant females about HDP  | 94(95.9)  | 48(81.3)  |\n| 4  | Can prescribe antihypertensive themselves when Bp was raised  | 73(74.4)  | 22(37.2)  |\n| 5  | Can independently manage severe cases  | 35(35.7)  | 20(33.8))  |\n| 6  | Confident in using MgSo4  | 68(69.3)  | 37(62.7)  |\n| 7  | Convulsions during pregnancy is hereditary  | 42(42.8)  | 32(54.2)  |\n| 8  | Pre-eclampsia can be prevented  | 82(83.6)  | 43(72.8)  |\n| 9  | It is the duty of only the pregnant women to prevent preeclampsia.  | 41(41.8)  | 26(44)  |\n| 10  | Pre-eclampsia cannot be managed  | 29(29.5%)  | 18(30.5)  |\n| 11  | Need to know more about HDP  | 89(90.8)  | 55(93.2)  |\n| 12  | I Know about WHO guidelines for HDP  | 68(69.3)  | 31(52.5)  |\n\n【58】Positive attitude in this regard was shown by only 36% trainee doctors & even less in nurses.

Figure 2 shows the KAP of trainee doctors & nurses regarding HDP.\n\n【60】Figure 2 KAP of trainee doctors & nurses.\n\n【61】Discussion\n\n【62】Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are commonly encoun-tered in practice & have since long bewildered health care work-ers. It is a disorder that， if timely detected & promptly managed can prevent progression to complications & in-turn， reduce ma-ternal & neonatal morbidity & mortality. Hence knowing the categories & complications of HDP is essential for its manage-ment.\n\n【63】This study aimed to assess the knowledge， attitude and prac-tice of trainee doctors & nurses regarding hypertension in preg nancy. There is a scarcity of research regarding KAP on HDP in India； hence this study was undertaken.\n\n【64】Knowledge\n\n【65】In our study， knowledge regarding HDP was satisfactory among72.2% of trainee doctors & 63.7% of nurses， similar to the study's results on nurses， where 67.9% had adequate knowledge \\[14\\]. In another study conducted by Stellenberg EL et al.，basic knowl-edge regarding HDP was 66.3% & was 56.4% regarding various risk factors \\[15\\].\n\n【66】In our study 83.43% correctly defined HDP；namely 93.87%trainee doctors & 66.10% nurses. In the study by Ndirahisha E et al.， 85.7% of physicians，83.3% of midwives and 65.3% of nurses correctly defined HDP，up to 74.2% of participants \\[16\\].\n\n【67】Hypertension during pregnancy is defined by Systolic arterial Pressure 之 of 140 mm Hg or Diastolic Arterial Pressure 2of90 mm Hg. Preeclampsia is defined by the development of hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation (>300mg/L). Pre-eclampsia & eclampsia was defined by 90.4% &94.9% respondents respectively which is similar to the study by Ndirahisha E et al with 90.2% & 95.8% respectively \\[16\\]. But it varied from the study by Olaoye T et al on health care providers， which was 78.2%\\[17\\].\n\n【68】The commonest symptom of preeclampsia stated by respon-dents was headache 88.1% & nausea 61.9%， similar to the study conducted by Olaoye T et al. in a maternity hospital. IUGR was the fetal complication stated by 87.3% of respondents in their study， similar to ours of 91% \\[17\\].\n\n【69】Regarding knowledge regarding prevention， only 64.4% of nurses had satisfactory knowledge， which was much lower than the trainee doctors (87.7%). On the other hand， 64% had knowl-edge about WHO guidelines， similar to the research among health care workers in Tanzania but different from the study of Olaoye T et al. with 81.3% \\[17\\]. The varied findings could result from a lack of information and education. The results indicate a lack of adequate knowledge & the importance of continuing medical education.\n\n【70】Practice\n\n【71】It cannot be emphasized enough that blood pressure control during pregnancy is crucial for the safety of both mothers and babies. Blood pressure (Bp) values during pregnancy have been associated with a continuous inverse effect on foetal growth\\[7，15\\]. Unfortunately， it is measured mainly by junior doctors &nurses in most institutions. Hence not appropriately knowing about the correct method of blood pressure measurement is hazardous.\n\n【72】Regarding blood pressure measurement， a study conducted by Gandeh MB et al on doctors & nurses； 97.2% of respon-dents agreed that blood pressure measurement is mandatory in all ANC visits， similar to our study with 96.8% responses\\[18\\].87.2% measured Bp of pregnant women without risk \\[14\\]. Most of our participants (98%) claimed to correctly & confi-dently measure blood pressure. But only 60.5% followed the conditions of correctly measuring Bp in practice， where trainee doctors performed better with 60.2% compared to only 61 % of nurses. Similarly， in the study by Ndirahisha E et al.， 96.9% of participants claimed to measure their blood pressure systemati-cally. Still， ideal measurement conditions were respected by only48.4% of participants \\[16\\]. In our study， 64% of trainee doctors& 70% of nurses measured Bp themselves， similar to 64 % of doctors & 78% of nurses in a study in a maternity hospital in Nigeria \\[17\\]. These results are higher than the study in Saudi Arabia \\[18\\] where around 53% of the doctors depended on Bp measurement by a competent staff and did not check it. This difference could be due to blood pressure being measured by junior staff in maximum institutions. These findings suggest a lack of implementation of knowledge.\n\n【73】Regarding various investigations for detection， 91.5% were able to state it. 93% of respondents stated urine analysis is important for detecting pre-eclampsia， similar to 92% by Olaoye T et al. \\[17\\]. The practice of doing dipstick tests for urine protein detection was with 80.2% of respondents， similar to Lehulu Tilahun study of 84.6%\\[14\\].\n\n【74】Regarding MgSo4 dosage， route & regimes； 98.9% & 96.6%in trainee doctors & nurses respectively stated it & was far better with just 26.7% in the study of Stellenberg EL et al \\[14，15，19\\]. This variation could be due to differences in Institution training.81% of respondents followed the Pitchard regime for MgSo4&were correctly able to state the dosage similar to the study with76% result \\[17\\]. However many were not administering it them-selves. The lack of experience with MgSO4 highlights the gap in knowledge and implementation of guidelines. To improve uteroplacental blood flow， 119 participants (75.7%) including78 (79.59%)trainee doctors & 41 (69.49) nurses， recommended\n\n【75】bed rest. As per our study， 63% thought that using low doses of aspirin and calcium allowed the prevention of preeclamp-sia. Health care workers need to know about antihypertensive drugs， their indications， contraindications， dosage and limita-tions. 80.6%&72.8% were using Labetalol as an antihyperten-sive drug of choice.\n\n【76】Counselling is an important part of health care. For example， reassuring pregnant women by explaining that their pregnancy can progress normally with proper treatment is important. How-ever， the practice of counselling regarding HDP was much lower in our study， with just 81.5% compared to other studies， showing that there are barriers in practice. On the other hand， 96% of trainee doctors & 81.3% of nurses stated that counselling about HDP should be done by showing a positive attitude towards patients， similar to the 98.9% study by Gandeh MB et al.\\[18\\].\n\n【77】As per the study results， respondents understood the seri-ousness of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia， but their knowledge& implementation was inadequate. As per our study， 62.1%of trainee doctors & 54.4% of nurses were following best prac-tices as far as HDP is concerned. The rest could be corrected by tailored practice sessions.\n\n【78】Attitude\n\n【79】All our respondents agreed that HDP is a high-risk pregnancy& can result in serious consequences； compared to Olaoye T et al. study， 26.4% disagreed regarding eclampsia as a serious disease \\[17\\]. 154 i.e. (98%) claimed to confidently & accurately measure blood pressure which included 58(98.30%)nurses & 96(97.95%) trainee doctors. 80% of respondents in our study con-sider pre-eclampsia preventable， similar to the study by Olaoye T et al. \\[17\\]. As per our study， 43% of trainee doctors & 54% of nurses thought convulsions during pregnancy to be hereditary compared to a study showing 43% \\[17\\].\n\n【80】Mental tension due to personal conflicts and the preference for a male child explained the hypertensive disorders of preg-nancy. Most of our respondents disagreed regarding the role of the tetanus toxoid vaccine in reducing the risk of pre-eclampsia. The result differs from the study conducted in rural India \\[19\\]. Still， it is similar to Nigeria's study in maternity hospitals \\[17\\]. This difference may be due to a misunderstanding of the under-lying causes.\n\n【81】46% disagreed in a study that only pregnant women must prevent preeclampsia. This is similar to our study， with 41.8%of trainee doctors & 44% of nurses showing a positive attitude towards HDP \\[171.\n\n【82】Among the 157 respondents， only 43.3% i.e.，48.9% trainee doctors &33.8% nurses were confident in managing severe cases alone， similar to the study by Gandeh MB et al. \\[18\\]. Thus the majority of respondents were not confident in managing hypertensive pregnant mothers are showing a lack of adequate training in them. Nevertheless， there was a positive attitude among 91.7% of respondents toward learning more about HDP.\n\n【83】In the study in Mozambique， only 14% reported confidence in specifically providing oral antihypertensives \\[17\\]， which was74% in trainee doctors & 37% in nurses in our study. This varia-tion could be due to newly structured teaching programmes in institutions.\n\n【84】In our study， 77.6% trainee doctors & 82.3% of nurses showed a positive attitude toward HDP turn， stating that dedicated training will help improve outcomes. A positive attitude is indicative of their high motivation for self-improvement.\n\n【85】The result of the present study is quite close to research done by Stellenberg et al. They found a gap in nurses' knowledge regarding hypertensive disorders during pregnancy \\[15\\].\n\n【86】Similarly， Remadurg et al. reported that nurses and commu-nity health workers need to update their training and regular assessment for their knowledge and competence regarding early diagnosis and treatment \\[19\\].\n\n【87】Our study highlights the need for training programmes for healthcare workers regarding HDP by assessing the gaps in knowledge and practices. Similarly SafaaS.Ahmed et al. re-ported that the number of nurses with suboptimal knowledge was high， which was reduced with the help of intensive educa-tional programmes \\[7\\]. The present study's finding concerning the improvement in nurses'knowledge agrees with Ariff et al. They proved the importance of regular training programs for health workers to address gaps and develop targeted continuing education modules \\[20\\].\n\n【88】Like our study， Sotunsa et al. also emphasized regular train-ing programs to improve staff knowledge and practice\\[21\\].\n\n【89】In our study， knowledge and practice among both groups were similar， but the attitude among both groups varied. There was a gap between knowledge & practice in both groups. How-ever， a positive association was seen between knowledge with previous training in Obstetrics. Health care workers recognise the serious nature of the disease and need urgent management.\n\n【90】As per a study， time spent on access to care is crucial and may alter maternal and fetal outcomes. As per them， a lack of standardized care protocol for eclampsia was seen as； 76.6%had convulsions post-admission， indicating the need to train medical staff & better transport facilities to handle obstetric emergencies\\[1\\]. Furthermore， as per a study on the assessment of facility readiness and provider preparedness for dealing with pre-eclampsia & PPH， there was a significant association be tween the respondent's knowledge & years of service， which was similar to our study \\[17\\]；hence training is essential.\n\n【91】Conclusion\n\n【92】Health care workers (trainee doctors & nurses) are the first health personnel to contact the patient at any healthcare centre. Thus， it is important to improve knowledge and practice regarding risk assessment， early detection， appropriate counselling & manage-ment to reduce complications. India is a developing nation &majority stay in rural areas where junior doctors are posted； they must have appropriate KAP for common & serious diseases like this.\n\n【93】In our study， there was a gap in knowledge and practice，e but the attitude towards learning was high in both groups， providing scope for improvement. In addition， most study respondents acknowledged the serious nature of the disease. They were aware of appropriate medications， though not the practicality of it. However， many of them were not comfortable treating women with HDP.\n\n【94】It is important to build upon these identified gaps to most effectively improve maternal and perinatal health outcomes. There should be opportunities for effective training of reasonable duration with clearly defined objectives under proper supervi-sion. The gap between knowledge & practice requires compre-hensive training， including identification， triage and treatment for women. Thus regular educational and skill improvement programs， up-to-date practical guides， regular assessments of their competence and confidence， CMEs， workshops， confer-ences and refresher courses in obstetrics， including skill labs，\n\n【95】are required. Counselling is a critical component of the health system & management of disease， which requires due attention. Special emphasis is needed on this in undergraduate and post-graduate curricula and training. Many barriers like insufficient training， legal restrictions， lack of confidence， sparse resources &funds need to be addressed. The unavailability of an adequate and effective health system with high calibre human resources &the attitude of health service providers is a stumbling block in the management of HDP. The maternal and neonatal mortality rates will continue to rise if urgent measures are not implemented to ensure targeted training.\n\n【96】Studies have shown that HDP could be prevented by proper antenatal screening of blood pressure， proteinuria， follow-up， and close monitoring and treatment by skilled healthcare work-ers. Hence it is of utmost importance to improve their skills which are our first contacts with patients & play a crucial role as decision-makers.\n\n【97】Abbreviations\n\n【98】1.\n\n【99】HDP ： hypertensive disorders of pregnancy\n\n【100】2\\.

Malignant degeneration of a pilonidal cyst is rare， with incidence estimated at 0.1%. The most common type is squamous cell carcino-ma and the treatment of choice remains en block resection of the lesion.\n\n【21】Case Report： We present the case of a patient with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma arising in a pilonidal cyst， due to misdiagnosis of the disease during his first treatment.\n\n【22】Conclusions： Detailed histological examination of all excised pilonidal cyst lesions is essential and any histological suspicion should prompt a wider excision.\n\n【23】MeSH Keywords： Carcinoma， Squamous Cell·Pilonidal Sinus· Sacrococcygeal Region\n\n【24】Full-text PDF http：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/892843\n\n【25】11\n\n【26】十1598 出0 4\n\n【27】￥20\n\n【28】Pilonidal disease is a chronic inflammatory condition mostly affecting white males ages 15-40 years. It is thought to be an acquired infection of natal cleft hair follicles， which become distended and obstructed and rupture into the subcutaneous tissues to form an abscess \\[1\\]. According to the literature， black and Asian people are rarely affected by the disease \\[2\\].\n\n【29】Untreated pilonidal disease may result in many complications， including multiple draining sinuses， recurrent abscess forma-tion， local cellulites， and， less frequently， osteomyelitis of the sacrum or coccyx\\[3\\].\n\n【30】Despite the high incidence of the disease， malignant degen-eration of a pilonidal cyst is rare. The incidence is estimated at 0.1% and is triggered by a chronic inflammatory process， occurring mostly in neglected primary lesions； therefore， it is most commonly seen in older people with longstanding dis-ease \\[4\\]. In 88% of the cases， the histological type is squa-mous cell carcinoma \\[4，5\\].\n\n【31】The purpose of this paper is to present the case of a patient with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma arising in a pi-lonidal cyst， as a consequence of misdiagnosis of the disease， and to review the literature.\n\n【32】Case Report\n\n【33】A 77-year-old white male patient was admitted in our clinic complaining of severe pain in the sacrococcygeal area due to recurrent pilonidal disease. In his medical history， he mentioned2 previous operations for a pilonidal cyst existing more than10 years. The first operation was performed in March 2013， and the second was 1 year later， due to recurrence of the dis ease. No histological confirmation of the excised specimen was done in either of the previous interventions.\n\n【34】Until the time of admission， the patient was being treated for a second recurrence of pilonidal disease. Due to severe pain， he received large doses of analgesics， including opioids and NSAIDs， with no result.\n\n【35】On clinical examination， he presented with a 5x5 cm ulcerat-ed，friable， bleeding mass in the sacrococcygeal area (Figure 1). Left inguinal lymphadenopathy was also noticed.\n\n【36】Laboratory tests on admission showed mild anemia with he-moglobin of 11.7 g/dl and hematocrit of 36.8% and mild leu-kocytosis with WCC of 11.500 K/pL， 80% segmented.\n\n【37】Figure 1. Squamous cell carcinoma in sacrococcygeal area.\n\n【38】Figure 2. Pelvic MRI shows the mass， which reaches the elevators ani muscles.\n\n【39】On a pelvic MRI performed 1 month before， a 3.3×2.7×4cm inflammatory mass was demonstrated， extending beyond the last coccygeal vertebra between the major gluteal muscles， reaching the junction of the elevators ani muscles (Figure 2).\n\n【40】An abdominal CT scan was performed， which revealed that the mass had destroyed the coccyx and invaded the elevators ani. It also extended to and affected the mesorectal fat， but the posterior wall of the rectum was intact. In addition， it demon-strated involvement of the left inguinal lymph nodes. No dis-tant metastasis was observed (Figures 3 and 4).\n\n【41】We decided to seek histological confirmation of the disease. Biopsies were taken from the lesion and the prominent lymph nodes from the left inguinal area. The results from the histo-logical examination showed a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the sacrococcygeal area and metastatic in-filtration of the left inguinal lymph nodes.\n\n【42】Figure 3. Abdominal CT scan shows the mass invading the coccyx and the elevators ani muscles.\n\n【43】Figure 4. Abdominal CT scan shows the mass extending to the mesorectal fat without involving the posterior wall of the rectum.\n\n【44】Due to the patient's severe general condition， it was decided to first treat him with local radiation therapy and chemotherapy.\n\n【45】Discussion\n\n【46】Pilonidal disease is generally a benign condition and malig-nancy is extremely rare， with an incidence estimated at 0.1%. Reviewing the literature， the low frequency of malignant de-generation of a pilonidal cyst is confirmed， with fewer than100 cases reported\\[6\\].\n\n【47】The first squamous cell carcinoma arising in a pilonidal sinus was described in 1900 by Wolff in a 21-year-old woman \\[7\\]. Ever since， there has been an increased concern of the possi-bility of malignant degeneration of a pilonidal cyst complicat-ed with recurrent episodes of inflammation \\[3\\].\n\n【48】The etiologic factors of the development of a squamous cell carcinoma in the sacrococcygeal area appear to be the same as with all chronically inflamed wounds such as burns， scars， ulcers， and fistulas， which may undergo malignant transfor-mation \\[8\\]. In 1828， Jean Nicolas Marjolin was the first to de scribe the occurrence of malignant transformation in unsta-ble scars and chronic ulcers \\[9，10\\]. The mechanism that leads to malignant degeneration seems to be related to a compro-mise of DNA-repairing mechanisms due to chronic inflamma-tion， which causes the release of free oxygen radicals by acti-vated inflammatory cells \\[11\\]. The development of carcinoma follows a certain sequence of events in which there is a tran-sition from squamous cell to squamous hyperplasia to carci-noma in situ to invasive carcinoma. This seems to be a long latent period of symptomatic pilonidal disease during which early lesions go unrecognized and untreated \\[5\\].\n\n【49】Therefore， the most important factor in the incidence of ma-lignant degeneration of a pilonidal sinus is the duration of the disease. Longstanding untreated or recurrent pilonidal disease appears to have a higher incidence of development of squamous cell carcinoma. The average age at presentation appears to be49 years， with an average duration of 23 years \\[12\\]. Seventy percent of patients with malignant degeneration of a pilo-nidal cyst have been symptomatic for at least 10 years \\[11\\].\n\n【50】During the Second World War， in a series of 86 333 pilonidal cysts treated in the U.S. Armed Forces， no malignancy was re-ported \\[13\\]. Apparently， early treatment in this young popula-tion prevented malignant degeneration and supports the the-ory of chronic transformation \\[8\\].\n\n【51】On clinical examination， pilonidal carcinoma usually appears as a painful， ulcerated， bleeding mass. According to the pa-tient’s medical history， it complicates a longstanding piloni-dal disease with recurrent episodes of abscess formation \\[6\\].\n\n【52】Carcinomas arising from pilonidal cysts grow slowly， but have a tendency towards local invasion and metastasis \\[14，15\\].Eight percent of the patients appear with bone involvement on di-agnosis \\[16\\]. Inguinal lymphadenopathy at the time of diag-nosis is related to a poor prognosis \\[17\\].\n\n【53】Preoperative evaluation should be designed to identify both the extent of local invasion of the disease and the presence of distant metastasis. An accurate clinical examination of the pa-tient's sacrococcygeal area， including inguinal areas for lymph node involvement， is essential. Preoperative lower endoscopy(sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy) is used to exclude extension of the disease into the rectum， as well as CT scan of the ab-domen and MRI of the pelvis to evaluate the local extent of the disease， distant metastasis， and iliac or para-aortic lymph node involvement \\[11\\]. If the degree of local inflammation is\n\n【54】severe， the patient may preoperatively require a short period of wound care and intravenous antibiotics \\[18\\].\n\n【55】The treatment of choice remains en block resection of the le-sion， including the presacral fascia， with tumor-free margins. Surgery appears to provide the only means of cure. In pa-tients with local extent to adjacent structures， a wider exci-sion is necessary， including coccygeal excision， decortication or resection of the sacrum， and total mesorectal excision \\[4\\]. Frequently， it is difficu lt to determine the margins of the tumor due to severe inflammatory reaction in the area. Therefore， it is crucial to clearly mark the margins of resection before sur-gery \\[8\\]. Defect reconstruction can be accomplished either with skin grafts or local flaps (gluteal rotation or gluteal ad-vancement flaps) or even by using free muscular or musculo-cutaneous flaps \\[6\\]. If the patient's clinical status does not al-low major interventions， the defect can be left open to close by secondary intention \\[4\\].\n\n【56】Postoperative radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy are rec-ommended. In a series of patients， Gill et al. reported a re-duction in local recurrence rate from 44% to 30% when radi-ation therapy was initiated postoperatively \\[17\\].\n\n【57】Almeida-Goncalves presented a series of 7 patients diagnosed with advanced disease and treated with liquid nitrogen cryo-therapy. Cryosurgery accomplishes deep and inclusive neoplas-tic sterilization， destroying the sacral fascia but not the bone， and without inducing metastasization. Local eradication was achieved in all cases (100% complete response). This demon-strates the value of cryosurgery as a promising intervention for such advanced cancers.\n\n【58】Postoperative follow-up includes regular check-ups every 3months for the first 2 years， every 6 months for the next 3years， and once every year after that \\[6\\]. It includes clinical examination of the sacrococcygeal and inguinal area， ultra-sound (if there is any sign of inguinal lymphadenopathy)，and CT of the abdomen to rule-out local recurrence or distant me-tastasis \\[18\\].\n\n【59】References：\n\n【60】1\\.

Prophylactic inguinal lymph node dissection is not recommended because there is not enough evidence to support an impact on patient survival \\[6，8，19\\]. Postoperative radiotherapy has been shown to decrease local recurrence to 30%. The role of chemotherapy is unclear and it has been suggested it be used in combination with resec-tion and radiotherapy for high-risk patients \\[16\\].\n\n【69】In our department， we consider that all excised pilonidal cyst lesions should be sent for detailed histological examination. Differential diagnosis should be made between squamous cell carcinoma and pseudocarcinomatous hyperplasia of squamous epithelium， which is related to the chronic inflammatory pro-cess \\[5\\]. Because cellular atypia and increased mitotic rate is found in pseudocarcinomatous hyperplasia as well， care-ful study of a wide tissue sampling is required to establish fi-nal diagnosis. Any histological suspicion of carcinoma should prompt a wider excision \\[20\\].\n\n【70】Conclusions\n\n【71】Pilonidal disease should be treated early in its history and all ex-cised specimens should be sent for histological examination， espe-cially in older patients (>40 years old) with longstanding disease. When dealing with a macroscopically suspicious lesion or when delayed healing is observed， the possibility of malignancy should be considered and new lesion biopsies should be performed \\[12\\]\n\n【72】Acknowledgements\n\n【73】The authors would like to thank the patient on whom this case report is based.\n\n【74】Competing interests\n\n【75】The authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n\n【76】7\\.

It is most often caused by infec-tion or autoimmune vasculitides such as giant cell or Takayasu's arteritis.\n\n【21】Case Report： The case presented is that of a 55-year-old man with symptomatic occlusion of the right coronary artery caused by a plasmacytic aortitis suggestive of IgG4 disease， which was successfully treated with coronary artery by-pass grafting and an ascending aortic graft.\n\n【22】Conclusions： A review of the current literature emphasizes how poorly the etiology and natural history of plasmacytic aor-titis is understood.\n\n【23】MeSH Keywords： Aortic Aneurysm · Aortitis·lmmunoglobulin G\n\n【24】Ful-text PDE http：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/898673\n\n【25】￥口9902\n\n【26】3\n\n【27】21\n\n【28】Aortitis is a condition characterized by inflammatory infiltra-tion of the aortic wall in response to autoimmune cell signal-ing \\[1-4\\]， as seen in Takayasu's arteritis and giant cell arte ritis， or with infections such as syphilis \\[5\\]， salmonella， and tuberculosis. Typically， patients with aortitis have either aor-tic dissections or aneurysms due to chronic inflammation.A small subset of patients have predominantly plasmacytic aor-titis of uncertain etiology. Recently lgG4 related disease has been associated with plasmacytic aneurysmal disease of the ascending aorta \\[6，7\\] as well as inflammatory infrarenal ab-dominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) \\[8\\]. This case report describes an atypical presentation of plasmacytic aortitis in which the symptoms were due to inflammatory occlusion of the ostium of the right coronary artery.\n\n【29】Case Report\n\n【30】The patient was a 55-year-old African American man who pre-sented to the Emergency Department of a peripheral hospital with complaints of vague chest pain， nausea， and dizziness. In the Emergency Department he suffered a cardiac arrest sec-ondary to ventricular fibrillation. He was quickly resuscitat-ed and did not have any neurological deficit. CT angiography was suggestive of intramural hematoma of the ascending aor-ta and arch (Figure 1). He was transferred to our institution for further evaluation.\n\n【31】Cardiac catheterization revealed a severe stenosis of the os-tium of the right coronary artery， with otherwise normal cor-onary arteries (Figure 2). Because the coronary stenosis ap-peared to be due to compression from the suspected intramural hematoma， he was taken to the operating room for surgical repair. Intra-operatively， the ascending aorta was noted to be firm with a thick wall (Figure 3). There was no evidence of dis-section or intramural hematoma.Transection of the ascending\n\n【32】Figure 1. CTA， suggestive of intramural hematoma.\n\n【33】Figure 2. Cardiac catheterization， right coronary artery stenosis.\n\n【34】Figure 3. Operative picture， thickened ascending aortic wall.\n\n【35】aorta revealed extreme thickening and edema of the aortic wall consistent with vasculitis. The right sinus of Valsalva also had evidence of inflammation causing severe stenosis at the ori-gin of the coronary artery. The aortic valve and remaining si-nuses of Valsalva appeared normal. The ascending aorta was resected and replaced from the sinotubular junction to the in-nominate artery with a 28-mm Dacron tube graft with end-to-end anastomoses. A saphenous vein bypass graft to the right coronary was then performed. In retrospect， if the diagnosis of aortitis had been clear， perhaps the right coronary steno-sis could have been corrected with a percutaneous stent. The patient tolerated the procedure without complications. He recovered rapidly and was discharged on the 7th postopera-tive day on oral steroid therapy. He returned with a superfi-cial wound infection at the saphenous vein harvest site， which healed well with conservative management. He remains asymp-tomatic with no evidence of aortic aneurysmal disease by CT scan. Pathology examination of the ascending aorta revealed\n\n【36】aortitis with marked fibrous thickening of the aortic wall and prominent hyaline thickening of vaso vasorum vessels， many of which were surrounded by significant， predominantly plas-macytic， chronic infiltration. Gram stain， fungal cultures， and AFB cultures were all negative. Qualitative and quantitative RPR (rapid plasma reagin) and syphilis lgG and IgM antibodies were also negative. Steiner staining of the aortic wall showed no spirochetes. Tissue staining for IgG4 revealed less than 30%of plasma cells were positive for IgG4. Serum IgG4 levels were normal， but the laboratory specimen was collected after treat-ment with oral steroids.\n\n【37】Discussion\n\n【38】Aortic aneurysms involving all segments of the aorta from the ascending to the infrarenal anatomy have long been recog-nized and attributed to a variety of autoimmune etiologies in-cluding Takayasu's arteritis and giant cell arteritis and other rheumatologic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis， Behget's disease， and Cogan’s syndrome \\[1-5\\]. However， a significant minority of cases (<10%)， usually classified as idiopathic，are associated with predominantly plasmacytic infiltrates rath-er than macrophages and lymphocytes. Some of these cases may be related to IgG4 disease but the etiology of other cas-es remains obscure 6-8\\].\n\n【39】IgG4-related aneurysmal disease has recently been identified in aneurysms affecting all segments of the aorta and may be an important etiology of inflammatory infrarenal AAA. IgG4-related disease has been identified with aneurysms of the thoracic aorta， but the criteria to establish the disease re main vague and undetermined \\[9，10\\].

The extent of the tumor was determined\n\n【30】by an ultrasound， and ICG (Diagnogreen， Daiichi-Sankyo Pharma， Tokyo， Japan) was injected subcutaneously and intradermally into the core and 2 marginal regions of the tumor (3 injections in total)， respectively. During surgery， the extent of the tumor was confirmed with a photodynamic eye， and the tumor was completely re-sected. A fluorescent portion macroscopically estimated as normal was additionally resected and no residual fluorescence or tumor were confirmed in the remaining tissue. Abnormal lymphatic vessels were histopatho-logically observed in the additionally resected tissue， indicating the invasion of LMs. The surgery had a good\n\n【31】outcome with no evidence of recurrence.\n\n【32】Conclusions： We performed near-infrared fluorescence-guided imaging surgery for the resection of LMs in the abdominal wall. This is a single case study； therefore， assessment of more cases is warranted for further validation. This procedure could provide significant benefit to patients requiring resection of LMs.\n\n【33】MeSH Keywords： Indocyanine Green · Lymphangioma · Optical Imaging· Spectroscopy， Near-Infrared\n\n【34】Full-text PDF http：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/903465\n\n【35】Lymphatic malformations (LMs) are benign refractory tumors characterized by proliferation of lymphatic vessels. Macrocystic LMs are effectively treated by sclerosing agents such as OK-432； however， the treatment of microcystic LMs is challenging. Surgical resection has been the criterion standard of treatment for microcystic LMs， but total resection is difficult in cases of diffused， nonencapsulated masses. Residual LMs can cause complications， such as lymphatic fluid retention and leakage， infection， and frequent recurrence \\[1\\].\n\n【36】Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence lymphography has re-cently been introduced to visualize lymph flow using a near-infrared camera. LMs have dilated lymphatic channels and do not have connections to the normal lymphatic system. They exhibit congested lymph flow； therefore， congestion of ICG within LMs after injection into the skin above the tumor was expected. We report the novel use of ICG fluorescence imag-ing for intraoperative identification of precise surgical mar-gins of LMs. This is the first report of navigation surgery utiliz-ing ICG fluorescence imaging for successful resection of LMs.\n\n【37】Case Report\n\n【38】The patient was a 15-year-old boy who was diagnosed with LMs in the abdominal wall at the age of 2 and had undergone sclerotherapy with OK-432 three times. The cystic lesion had disappeared， but a cavernous lesion 20x30x45 mm in size re-mained. Bleeding from bruises frequently occurred； there-fore， surgical resection was planned. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) failed to clearly determine the ex-tent of the tumor (Figure 1). Before the surgery， off-label use of ICG was approved by our Institutional Review Board， and informed consent was obtained from the patient and his par-ents. The extent of the tumor was re-examined by ultrasound， and 0.05 ml (0.125 mg) ICG (Diagnogreen@， Daiichi-Sankyo Pharma， Tokyo， Japan) was injected subcutaneously and in-tradermally into the core and 2 marginal regions of the tumor(a total of 3 injections). About 20 h after the injection， fluo-rescence images of LMs were obtained with a photodynamic eye (PDE； Hamamatsu Photonics， Shizuoka，Japan)， which ac-tivates ICG with light emitted at a wavelength of 760 nm and filters out light at wavelengths below 830 nm. The fluorescence signal provided a real-time image of the LMs. Although the border was not clearly visualized because of ICG spillage，the extent of the tumor was confirmed with the PDE during sur-gery， and the tumor was completely resected (Figure 2). A flu-orescent portion estimated to be normal macroscopically was additionally removed， and no residual fluorescence or tumor were confirmed in the remaining tissue. Abnormal lymphatic vessels were histopathologically observed in the additionally\n\n【39】Figure 1. Preoperative MRI scan.\n\n【40】Figure 2. The tumor was resected by confirming the extent of the tumor with PDE during surgery.\n\n【41】Figure 3. The additionally resected portion showing ICG fluorescence.\n\n【42】resected subcutaneous tissue， indicating the invasion of LMs. These endothelial cells lining the vessel structures were immu-nohistochemically reactive with D2-40 and CD31 and nonre-active with CD34. A slide of the additionally resected portion showed fluorescence signal (Figure 3). The patient has been followed up with echography every 4 weeks after surgery. The surgery had a good outcome with no lymphatic fluid retention and no evidence of recurrence.\n\n【43】LMs are rare， nonmalignant， and proliferative changes of lymph vessels \\[2\\]. LMs invade the surrounding tissues and have ob-scure borders； therefore， recurrence from residual tissue is a problem. The tumor borders are macroscopically and micro-scopically vague because LMs are nonencapsulated. Since LMs are benign tumors， large resection of LMs should be avoided because of cosmetic disadvantages， such as resection wounds and depressed scars； therefore， surgeons struggle to find the appropriate balance between thorough and minimal resection.\n\n【44】Near-infrared fluorescence-guided imaging surgery with ICG has been recently employed in various types of surgeries \\[3-6\\]. ICG is a very safe compound that has been widely used in a variety of clinical situations， such as examination of hepat-ic and cardiac functions and retinal angiography. ICG primar-ily binds to albumin， which drains into the lymphatic vessels. This property of ICG， as well as of methylene blue， has been used in lymphatic imaging for evaluating lymphedema and mapping sentinel nodes in various types of cancers by fluo-rescence navigation \\[7-9\\]. ICG fluorescence imaging is a safe and minimally invasive technique.\n\n【45】To our knowledge， the use of ICG fluorescence imaging in the treatment of LMs has not yet been reported. Based on lymph flow congestion in LMs， we expected congestion of ICG within LMs after injecting ICG into the skin above the tumor (subcuta-neously and intradermally). The ICG dosage was determined on the basis of previous reports \\[10-12\\].Subcutaneous injection\n\n【46】References：\n\n【47】1\\.

The best injection site remains to be determined； however， since LMs have dilated lymphat-ic channels and no connections to the normal lymphatic sys-tem， once ICG is absorbed into the abnormal tissue in LMs， it will be retained and completed in every detail of LMs. One study revealed that photodynamic hyperthermal therapy us-ing ICG and near-infrared light source induces apoptosis \\[14\\].

The large size and increased vascularity of the average infant adrenal gland increase the bleeding tendency. Predisposing factors may include macrosomia， birth asphyxia， perinatal injuries， septicemia， and coagulopathy. Nevertheless， it can also occur without apparent risk factors. The most common findings are poor feeding， vomiting， persistent jaundice， anaemia， and abdominal mass. However， the event may be asymptomatic and be detected incidentally. Ultrasound imaging is the cornerstone of diagnosis and follow-up monitoring. Herein， we report an unusual case of a male newborn with an adrenal haemorrhage associated with hypertension. The lesion was detected by ultrasound as an echogenic cystic mass at the right suprarenal area. The mass was initially mimicking neuroblastoma. Nevertheless， the normal levels of urine catecholamine metabolites and the regression of the mass size verified the diagnosis. The infant was managed conservatively， and the mass entirely resolved without calcification or adrenal insufficiency.\n\n【5】KEYWORDS adrenal haemorrhage， neonatal hypertension， neuroblastoma， suprarenal mass， adrenal calcification\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Adrenal haemorrhage (AH) is a relatively uncommon clinical problem in the neonatal period.

Abdominal ultrasound facilitates the diagnosis of adrenal haemorrhage， particularly when the clin-ical presentation is subtle. AH commonly appears as a round cystic lesion with no blood flow. Hypertension is an uncommon problem in neonates， and AH is an exceedingly rare acquired cause of neonatal hypertension \\[3\\].\n\n【14】Case report\n\n【15】A full-term baby boy was a product of difficult vaginal deliv-ery associated with shoulder dystocia at a peripheral hospital. The mother was a 30-year-old primigravida with an uneventful pregnancy apart from amniotic fluid leaking for the last 2 days. The parents were nonconsanguineous with unremarkable family history. The birth weight was 3.4 kg， and the Apgar score was8，9， and 9 at one， five， and ten minutes， respectively. The baby was observed to have severe right Erb's palsy and hypoactiv-ity；therefore， he was shifted to the NICU for admission. Basic laboratory investigations， chest and abdomen x-ray， and blood\n\n【16】cultures were taken then intravenous antibiotics and fluids were commenced. After stabilization， oral feeding was started and initially tolerated. However， at 20 hours， the baby developed poor feeding， vomiting， and more lethargy. Urgent brain and abdominal ultrasound revealed cerebral oedema with multi-foci of petechial haemorrhages. The abdominal ultrasound study was normal.\n\n【17】On the 2nd day of life， the baby was transferred to our hospi-tal for further management. The baby was stable on room air on arrival with normal vital signs. The physical examination was unremarkable except for the severe right Erb's palsy. Labora-tory data were normal， including complete blood counts， blood chemistry， coagulation profile， and C-reactive protein. Repeated blood culture was negative. He developed unexplained indirect hyperbilirubinemia and received phototherapy. On the 4th day of life， follow-up brain US was normal. However， the abdominal US (figure1) showed a heterogeneous cystic mass (2.6x2.3 cm) in the right suprarenal region.\n\n【18】Figure 1 The abdominal US showed a heterogeneous cystic adrenal mass measured (2.6x2.3 cm) with some internal hypoe-choic areas.\n\n【19】The mass was not connected to the renal collecting system， and both kidneys were normal. The colour flow Doppler study(figure 2) showed no blood flow inside the mass， and the renal arteries were normal. On the 6th day of life， the baby started to have sustained hypertension， and Ⅳ hydralazine was com-menced. An echocardiogram revealed a normal heart and aorta. An adrenal mass was reported， and a CT scan abdomen was advised for proper identification. CT scan abdomen with an adrenal protocol (figure 3) revealed a well-defined 2.8x1.6x2cm right adrenal mass that showed slight heterogeneous pre-contrast hypodensity and heterogeneous enhancement in post-contrast images. There were no foci of calcifications within the mass， and the left adrenal gland was normal. The history of high blood pressure， persistent mass size with abnormal echo-texture， and the enhancement in post-contrast CT images ne-cessitated the exclusion of adrenal tumours like neuroblastoma and ganglioneuroma. Therefore， the levels of catecholamine metabolites (vanillylmandelic acid and homovanillic acid) in24-hour urine collection were tested， and the results were nor-mal. Urine microscopy and chemistry were also normal. The subsequent abdominal US showed the resolution of the cystic area， but the mass size was the same. Brain MRI was done， and it was essentially normal.\n\n【20】Figure 2 The Color Doppler image showed a heterogeneous mass at the right suprarenal region with no blood flow within the area of the haemorrhage.\n\n【21】Figure 3 Abdominal CT scan with IV contrast (Axial A and Coronal B) demonstrated a right-sided adrenal mass (arrows) with hypodense areas representing adrenal haemorrhage.\n\n【22】ratory results， the diagnosis of the right AH was made， and conservative management was considered.\n\n【23】After 14 days of hydralazine treatment， the blood pressure normalized， and the dose was gradually reduced and discontin-ued. The infant was on regular physiotherapy with progressive improvement in his right Erb's palsy. On the 38th day of life， the abdominal US showed complete resolution of the adrenal mass. The patient was discharged home in good condition and given regular follow-up. During the subsequent visits， there was neither recurrence of hypertension nor the adrenal mass. When writing this article， the child was 15 months old， healthy with normal growth and development.\n\n【24】Discussion\n\n【25】AH is the most common adrenal mass in neonates and is more frequent than in older children. The large size of the neonatal adrenal gland， and its excessive vascularity may contribute to the bleeding vulnerability. The incidence of AH varies from 1.7per 1000 autopsied neonates to approximately 3% of the infants undergoing the abdominal US. The right side is involved in 70%of the cases due to compression between the liver and the kidney， and it is bilateral in 10% of the cases \\[4\\].\n\n【26】The pathophysiology of adrenal haemorrhage is not yet fully known， and it is deemed to be multifactorial. Acute fluctuation of blood pressure and abnormalities in autoregulation occur-\n\n【27】ring immediately after birth contribute to the adrenal bleed. The possible risk factors include maternal diabetes， macrosomia， perinatal asphyxia， neonatal sepsis， prolonged labour， traumatic delivery， and bleeding disorders. Moreover spontaneous occur-rences have also been recognized in normal neonates \\[5\\].\n\n【28】Clinical presentation can vary from asymptomatic minimal bleeding to fulminant bleeding resulting in severe hypovolemic shock， adrenal failure， or death. Physical findings include palpa-ble abdominal mass， unexplained anemia， prolonged jaundice， hematuria， and bluish scrotal discoloration. The adrenal gland has a considerable regenerative capacity， and adrenal insuffi-ciency rarely occurs \\[6\\]. AH is a rare cause of neonatal hyperten-sion. The possible mechanisms may include direct stimulation of the adrenal medulla to release catecholamines by humeral factors derived from the hematoma， transient compression of the renal artery， and obstruction of the collective renal system secondary to the displacement of the kidney by the mass \\[7\\].\n\n【29】Abdominal ultrasound remains the modality of choice for both the initial screening and the follow-up. Computed tomog-raphy (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used to confirm the presence of the haemorrhage or to exclude malig-nancies \\[8\\]. The ultrasound appearance depends on the stage of the haemorrhage ranging from an echogenic lesion in the acute stage to a cystic or multicystic appearance in the subacute and chronic stages.Ultimately， the adrenal mass becomes ane-choic， shrinks then resolves completely or is left with a rim of calcification. AH shows consistently no vascularization in the colour flow Doppler study \\[9\\]. The main differential diagnoses of neonatal AH are congenital neuroblastoma， adrenal abscess， congenital adrenal hyperplasia， lung sequestration， mesoblastic nephroma， and urinary or intestinal tract duplications. However， neuroblastoma is the most important entity requiring immediate attention due to its notorious extension and the need for urgent interventions 101.\n\n【30】Neuroblastoma is the most common neonatal tumour with an incidence of 0.61 per 100，000 live births. It accounts for 28-39% of all malignancy in the first month of life. The sonographic appear-ance of neuroblastoma is commonly a homogeneous echogenic solid mass， which will continue to increase in size. Moreover， blood flow signals can be detected by the colour flow Doppler study \\[11\\]. Neuroblastoma can also have the sonographic ap-pearance of a hemorrhagic adrenal cyst. The distinction from AH can be challenging and inconclusive. The adrenal gland is the most common site of primary localization. Adrenal tumours should be suspected if the mass is not resolved within 90 days\\[12\\]. The level of urinary catecholamine metabolites does not fulfil the role of a screening test for neuroblastoma. However， increased levels of these metabolites may suggest a diagnosis other than AH\\[13\\].\n\n【31】A noninvasive approach is strongly recommended in the management of neonatal AH. Infants with acute haemorrhages need urgent blood replacement and administration of vitamin K. Hydrocortisone should be given in all bilateral haemorrhages and cases not responding adequately to blood or intravenous fluid administration. The outcome of the adrenal haemorrhage is usually excellent. Laparotomy is indicated when haemor-rhage seems to be continuing， especially when the exact site of haemorrhage is in doubt \\[14\\]J..\n\n【32】Conclusion\n\n【33】Neonatal AH imposes diagnostic and management difficulties. It should be considered and looked for in at-risk newborns\n\n【34】with macrosomia， perinatal asphyxia， traumatic deliveries， over-whelming sepsis， and bleeding diathesis. Still， abdominal sonog-raphy is the best modality for diagnosing and monitoring AH. Adrenal hematomas should be scrutinized in hypertensive new-borns with a history of delivery complications. Serial ultrasound studies along with specific laboratory tests can establish the di-agnosis in many cases. We present this case owing to the rare presentation of neonatal AH with hypertension. We aim to em-phasise the importance of careful blood pressure monitoring and the effectiveness of conservative therapy in AH.\n\n【35】Funding\n\n【36】This work did not receive any grant from public， commercial， or not-for-profit funding agencies.\n\n【37】Conflict of Interest\n\n【38】There are no conflicts of interest to declare by any of the authors of this article.\n\n【39】References\n\n【40】1\\.

Whilst they offer several advantages over unfractionated heparin and are considered safe and efficacious， major bleeding episodes with low-molecular-weight heparins are estimated to occur at a rate of up to 1%\\[1\\].\n\n【23】CASE REPORT\n\n【24】A 79 year-old woman with no significant medical history presented with a 2 day history of palpitations and nausea. A diagnosis of new-onset atrial fibrillation was made， and as the exact time of onset was not known， she was anticoagulated with enoxaparin (1mg/kg 12hourly) and warfarin whilst awaiting transoesophageal echocardiography-guided cardioversion. On the third day of admission， she developed pain and swelling at the site of enoxaparin administration into the right anterior abdominal wall. Consequently further doses of enoxaparin were withheld.\n\n【25】The following day she complained of worsening abdominal pain， suffered two hypotensive episodes with systolic blood pressures of 75 and 80 mmHg， and became oliguric. Blood tests revealed a drop in haemoglobin concentration from a baseline of 126 g/L to 86 g/L and an INR (International Normalised Ratio) of 3.6 (target range 2-3).\n\n【26】An urgent abdominal CT scan was requested， which demonstrated a prominent haematoma in the right rectus sheath measuring 6x 8 cm (Figure 1)， and a larger haematoma in the right pelvis measuring 15 x9 cm (Figure2). The scan also demonstrated mild hydronephrosis of the right kidney， with a dilated ureter to the level of the pelvic inlet. Delayed enhancement of the right cortex was consistent with a degree of ureteric obstruction.\n\n【27】Figure 1. Rectus sheath hematoma 6x8 cm.\n\n【28】The patient was successfully resuscitated with intravenous colloids and 4 units of packed red cells. In addition， a complete reversal of anticoagulation was achieved by transfusing 6 units of fresh frozen plasma and administering 10 mg of vitamin K. A repeat blood test demonstrated an INR of 1.3. The oliguria， which could partly be attributed to the hypovolemia and partly to the ureteric obstruction， also improved with adequate fluid resuscitation. The patient remained haemodynamically stable and was subsequently transferred to the coronary care unit for further management of her fast atrial fibrillation.\n\n【29】DISCUSSION\n\n【30】Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMHs) are widely used for inpatient thromboembolic prophlaxis. They are increasingly being used for a range of therapeutic applications in both the inpatient and outpatient setting， including treatment of deep vein thrombosis(DVT)， and acute coronary syndromes. Low-mole cular-weight heparins offer several advantages over unfractionated heparin， including subcutaneous administration， not requiring monitoring of APTT(activated partial thromboplastin time)， and reduced risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and osteoporosis. A recent Cochrane review' comparing the use of low-molecular-weight heparins with adjusted dose unfractionated heparin showed the rate of major haemorrhage to be 1.0% with LMHs and 2.1% with unfractionated heparin. However， major bleeding episodes with enoxaparin have been stated to occur at a rate of up to 5.2%\\[2\\].\n\n【31】There are several reports in the literature of eno xaparin-associated rectus sheath \\[3\\] and retro-peritoneal \\[4\\] haematomas. Enoxaparin has also been implicated in haematoma formation in the context of invasive procedures such as spinal and\n\n【32】Figure 1. Riqht pelvic hematoma 15x9 cm.\n\n【33】epidural anaesthesia， lumbar plexus block \\[5\\]， and central neuraxial blockade \\[6\\]. Montoya et al. \\[7\\] report the case of a patient anticoagulated with enoxaparin for a right femoral DVT， who died as a result of retroperitoneal haemorrhage， and Chan-Tack \\[8\\] reports the case of a fatal spontaneous retroperitoneal haematoma in a patient treated with enoxaparin for acute coronary syndrome. A Medline search from 1966 to 2004 revealed no previously reported cases of concomitant pelvic and rectus sheath hematomas， in patients anticoagulated prior to cardioversion.\n\n【34】Anticoagulation of patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation prior to cardioversion， has been the subject of intense research in recent years. Traditionally patients have been anticoagulated with unfractionated heparin and an oral anticoagulant. Fonseca et al.\\[9\\] recommend 3 weeks of effective anticoagulation with enoxaparin and warfarin prior to cardioversion， when the time of onset of atrial fibrillation is not known.

Although they have several advantages over unfractionated heparin， these advantages must always be weighed against the potential for significant， and even fatal， haemorrhage. The factors which increase the risk of major bleeding episodes include high doses， renal impairment， advanced patient age， and concomitant use of drugs affecting haemostasis \\[2，3\\].

Although the underlying mechanisms have not been completely clar-ified， it has been suggested that the Janus kinase 2 (AK2) mutation， which is frequently identified in PV， can be involved in the development and/or progression of these distinct diseases in patients with MPNs. However， no reports have described the coexistence of PH and malignant lymphoma in patients with MPNs.\n\n【33】Case Report ： A 79-year-old man being treated for PV for 27 years and PH for 5 years was hospitalized due to severe dys-\n\n【34】pnea at rest. His soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels gradually increased and the chest computed tomography showed remarkable progression of the lung lesions and an enlargement of the mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes. A lymph node biopsy was performed and the patient was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lympho-ma (DLBCL). Owing to his poor condition， chemotherapy was not initiated， and he died on the 89th day of hos-pitalization. The pathological autopsy revealed the destruction of alveolar structures with neoplastic space-oc-cupying lesions of DLBCL. Multifactorial features of PH associated with MPNs， including the intimal thickening of pulmonary arteries accompanied by megakaryocytes and obstructed pulmonary arteries with organized thrombi in the lung tissue specimens， were observed. We found a JAK2 mutation based on a genetic analysis\n\n【35】of the patient's bone marrow.\n\n【36】Conclusions\n\n【37】We present the rare case of a patient who had PV with a JAK2 mutation， which coexisted with PH and DLBCL， and he developed severe refractory respiratory failure.\n\n【38】Keywords： Hypertension， Pulmonary · Janus Kinase 2 ·Lymphoma， Large B-Cell， Diffuse·\n\n【39】Myeloproliferative Disorders · Polycythemia Vera\n\n【40】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/932956\n\n【41】\\]11662 18\n\n【42】Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a group of hemato-logic disorders caused by the clonal proliferation of the bone marrow stem cells； these include polycythemia vera (PV)， essential thrombocythemia， and primary myelofibrosis \\[1\\]. Although patients with MPNs have an increased risk of throm-bohemorrhagic complications， these disorders are indolent in nature \\[2，3\\]. MPNs gradually worsen and eventually lead to bone marrow fibrosis or can transform to a blast crisis， includ-ing acute leukemia.\n\n【43】MPNs cause pulmonary hypertension (PH) through various mechanisms， and this is associated with a poor prognosis \\[4\\]. The current PH guidelines classify PH into 5 groups based on the underlying etiology and mechanism， and MPN-associated PH is classified as PH with unclear multifactorial mechanisms(Group 5) \\[5\\]. Most patients with MPNs， especially those with PV， have a mutation in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene， and this contributes to the pathogenesis of MPNs \\[6\\]. Aberrant Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription(JAK-STAT) signaling mediates PH through the dysregulation of nitric oxide (NO) and cytokine levels \\[7\\]. A possible associa-tion between the JAK2 mutation and an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) has been reported； however， my-eloid neoplasms mainly represent the subsequent hematologic neoplasms in patients with MPNs \\[8，9\\]. We report one of the first cases of a patient who had PH associated with PV and a JAK2 V617F mutation that rapidly developed into progressive respiratory failure due to NHL. Our case report demonstrates that PV patients are at risk of developing PH and NHL and a genetic background associated with the JAK2 mutation could be involved. This highlights the importance of managing PV patients， keeping in mind the risk of these distinct complica-tions， especially in patients with a JAK2 mutation.\n\n【44】Case Report\n\n【45】A 79-year-old man had an emergency admission to our hos-pital due to severe dyspnea at rest. He had a 27-year history of PV diagnosed at the age of 52 years， which had been well managed with hydroxycarbamide. In addition， he had a 5-year history of PH and a family history of gastric cancer. Right heart catheterization (RHC) performed at the time of diagnosis of the PH had revealed a mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) of39 mmHg， pulmonary artery wedge pressure of 9 mmHg， high cardiac output of 9.2 L/min， and a corresponding pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) of 3.3 Wood units. He was diagnosed with PH associated with PV (Group 5) and was treated with a triple combination therapy of pulmonary vasodilators (bosen-tan， sildenafil， and beraprost).

The red blood cell count revealed anemia， although the white blood cells and platelet counts were within the normal ranges (Table 1). Blood biochemistry was almost normal， except for an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level， slightly elevated brain natriuretic peptide level， and mildly elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor(sIL-2R) level. Chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) on admission revealed multiple nodules of variable sizes， and consolidations with ground-glass attenuation in both lung fields(Figure 1A， 1B). A bronchoscopy was planned to determine the cause of acute respiratory failure； however， we could not per-form it， as the patient declined intubation. None of our thera-peutic interventions (including antibiotics， steroids， and non-in-vasive positive pressure ventilation) were effective. His slL-2R levels increased to 3239 IU/mL and a follow-up chest CT on the70h day of hospitalization showed remarkable progression of the pulmonary lesions along with enlarged mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes (Figure 1C). An examination of the biopsy spec-imens obtained from the axillary lymph nodes revealed large lymphoid cells that were positive for CD20， CD79a， BCL-6， and MUM1 and negative for CD10， on immunohistochemical staining. He was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).\n\n【52】Given his poor condition (performance status 4)， chemotherapy was not initiated，and he died on the 89th day of hospitalization.\n\n【53】With the consent of his family， a pathological autopsy was performed， and this revealed the destruction of alveolar struc-tures with neoplastic space-occupying lesions in both lungs(Figure 2A， 2B). Immunohistochemical staining of the specimen taken from the lung tumor confirmed the histological diagno-sis of DLBCL， which was compatible with the findings from the lymph node biopsy specimen. A fibrous thickening of the inti-mal layer of the pulmonary arteries was seen (Figure 3A， 3B) in the lung tissue specimens. Plexiform lesions， which are ad-vanced changes in the pulmonary artery and typically occur in cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension， were not detect-ed. Some pulmonary arteries were obstructed by organized thrombi with many perforations， indicating that recanaliza-tion had commenced after pulmonary thrombosis (Figure 3C). Megakaryocytes were found in the lung tissue specimens， which was suggestive of extramedullary hematopoiesis (Figure 3D). Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease was not detected. Genetic analysis revealed that the bone marrow was positive for a JAK2mutation. The genetic analysis was approved by the Ethics\n\n【54】Kameda S. et al：\n\n【55】Figure 2.

It conformed to the Ethical Guidelines of Medical and Health Research involving human subjects in Japan and all the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. We obtained informed consent from the patient's family.\n\n【58】Discussion\n\n【59】We present the case of a patient with MPN-associated PH that developed into severe refractory respiratory failure. Although multifactorial PH was suspected to contribute to the patient's chronic dyspnea，aggressive NHL was finally diagnosed as the cause of fatal respiratory failure. Although PH and NHL are en-tirely different disease entities， we speculate that the JAK2 mu-tations could have been involved in the onset and/or progres-sion of these diseases during the course of the PV.\n\n【60】In patients with MPNs， PH is an important complication that is associated with poor prognosis \\[4\\]. According to the current PH guidelines， PH associated with MPNs is classified as PH with unclear multifactorial mechanisms (Group 5) \\[5\\]. Various mech-anisms for MPN-associated PH have been proposed，including thromboembolism， portopulmonary hypertension， high cardi-ac output， and the obstruction of pulmonary microvasculature by circulating megakaryocytes. Megakaryocytes that translo-cate from the bone marrow to the lungs can secrete vasoactive cytokines that could lead to the development of PH \\[10\\]. The pathological evaluation of our case showed intimal thicken-ing in the pulmonary arteries accompanied by megakaryocyte infiltration and obstructed pulmonary arteries with organized thrombi， which were compatible with the previously report-ed multifactorial features of PH associated with MPNs. In ad-dition， JAK2 mutations were detected in this case. STAT acti-vation through hyperphosphorylation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension， as it pro-motes hyperproliferation of the vascular endothelial cells and angiogenesis \\[11\\]. Although a conflicting case has been report-ed \\[12\\]， there are some case reports that have demonstrated that JAK inhibition with ruxolitinib improved MPN-associated PH \\[7，13\\]. Tabarroki et al reported that ruxolitinib therapy for patients with myelofibrosis improved PH. They demonstrated that ruxolitinib contributed to an increase in plasma-NO levels， and a reduction in the inflammatory cytokines (IL-4， IL-6， IL-8， TNF-o) and the granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor， suggesting that aberrant JAK-STAT signaling can medi-ate PH through the dysregulation of NO and cytokine levels \\[7\\].\n\n【61】In contrast， patients with MPNs have an increased risk of de-veloping a second hematologic malignancy compared to the general population \\[9\\]. Although the subsequent hematolog-ic neoplasms were mainly myeloid leukemia， the coexistence of MPNs with a lymphocytic proliferative neoplasm (LPN) has\n\n【62】been reported \\[8，9，14\\]. The most common combination was MPNs and chronic lymphocytic leukemia； however， the coexis-tence of MPNs and NHL is rare \\[14\\]. A limited number of case reports describe the association between MPNs and NHL \\[8，15\\]. Popov et al reported a case of PV with a JAK2 mutation that was simultaneously diagnosed with DLBCL They summarized 25 pre-viously reported cases of PV and NHL and found that PV diag nosed at the onset with the subsequent development of B-cell lymphoma was the most representative in their case series 16\\]. The clinical features of our case are consistent with their find-ings. There are no reports that describe the coexistence of PH and NHL in patients with MPNs. To the best of our knowledge， this is the first case report where 2 distinct complications (PH and NHL) developed sequentially during the course of PV with a JAK2 mutation. The coexistence of these complications is sel-dom seen， possibly because each of these complications is rare and develops at different times during the long course of MPNs.\n\n【63】Aberrant JAK-STAT signaling contributes to the pathogenesis of MPNs and can be involved in the development of lympho-mas through the dysregulation of proliferation， differentiation， and apoptosis of hematopoietic cells \\[17\\]. The risk of devel-oping LPN was significantly increased in patients with MPNs who had JAK2 mutations \\[8\\].A high rate of JAK2 mutations has been reported in patients with MPNs who subsequently devel-oped LPN \\[18\\]. Based on previous reports， we assume that the JAK-STAT pathway could have played a critical role in the de-velopment and/or progression of NHL and PH in our patient.\n\n【64】Conclusions\n\n【65】We present a rare case of PV with coexisting PH and NHL.JAK inhibitors play an important role in the treatment of MPNs； however， their efficacy in the treatment of PH and NHL asso-ciated with MPNs has not been established. Therefore， further studies are required to elucidate the involvement of JAK2 muta-tions in the pathogenesis of PH and NHL in patients with MPNs.\n\n【66】Department and Institution Where Work Was Done\n\n【67】Depaitment of Cardiovascular Medicine， Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine， Suita.

Duplex ultrasonography demonstrated no evidence of fluid collection or thrombosis. An initial MRI (without contrast) report was misleadingly suggestive of polymyositis. Orthopedic consultant urged the patient to transfer to the operating room for aspiration of a probable infec-tious nidus， which resulted in a dry tap. Despite confusing radiological clues， ischemic myonecrosis was sus-pected， and second MRI studies (with contrast) reported necrosis. Tissue biopsy (the criterion standard) was withheld to avoid the risk of delayed healing or superimposed infection. Meanwhile， the patient received sup-\n\n【27】portive treatment and achieved full recovery within 1 month.\n\n【28】Conclusions：\n\n【29】Diabetic myonecrosis should be suspected in any poorly controlled diabetic patient presenting with otherwise unexplained muscle pain without any evidence of infection. Diagnosis can be made by MRl， leaving very few indications for invasive procedures. Analgesics and glycemic control are the mainstays of treatment.\n\n【30】MeSH Keywords： Arm Injuries · Diabetes Complications· Magnetic Resonance Imaging· Muscle， Skeletal·Necrosis\n\n【31】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/917030\n\n【32】十1609 十F1 L\n\n【33】4\n\n【34】10\n\n【35】Myonecrosis， as one of the least expected complications of diabetes， typically manifests with extreme pain of the lower limb. Notwithstanding its complete resolution in the short term， the long-term prognosis is poor， with the majority of cases fail-ing to survive 5 years following hospitalization for myonecro-sis \\[1，2\\]. Although thigh muscles are the common sites of in-sult， there are rising numbers of case reports with upper-limb muscle involvement as well \\[2\\]. Herein， we present an atypi-cal case of myonecrosis developing in the left arm of a patient known to have diabetes.\n\n【36】Case Report\n\n【37】A 53-year-old white (Turkic) woman with 20-year history of dia-betes was referred to the rheumatology ward， tertiary hospital of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences， complaining of pain-ful swelling on the medial side of left arm for the past week. Her other medical history was significant for ischemic cere-brovascular accident 3 years ago with no sequel and uncon-trolled hypertension. She was reportedly noncompliant with her medications for glycemic control. Her last visit to the phy-sician was 2 years ago； her most recent medication included daily glibenclamide 5 mg， insulin glargine 30 units， and daily captopril 50 mg. She had no history of tobacco smoking， alco-hol， or substance abuse.\n\n【38】Physical examination revealed left arm swelling character-ized by warmth， mild erythema， tenderness， and excruciating pain on motion (Figure 1). There was no evidence of gangrene. Peripheral pulses were symmetric and full. Muscle force and sensory exam of the affected limb were normal， although the patient resisted movement to avoid the pain.\n\n【39】She denied any history of prior trauma and injection at the site. The patient's temperature was 37°C， blood pressure was 170/100 mmHg， pulse was 76/minute，respirations were16/minute， and oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. She appeared neither ill nor toxic. The list of differential diagnoses primarily consisted of thrombosis， cellulitis， fasciitis， abscess， pyomyositis， hematoma， muscle rupture， tumor， Fracture， and muscle infarction (myonecrosis). Laboratory and radiological imaging studies were conducted. On initial evaluations， soft-tissue edema was evident on plain radiography， without soft-tissue emphysema (Figure 2). The ultrasound revealed gener-alized muscular and subcutaneous edema with no collection or abnormal drainage in left arm and forearm.\n\n【40】Laboratory data were normal except for： random blood glu-cose=314 mg/dl (normal 79-160 mg/dl)/HbA1c=9.6%(normal\n\n【41】Figure 1. Ischemic myonecrosis of left arm in poorly controlled diabetic patient. She first presented with a painful left arm swelling. Erythema of overlying skin is notable compared to the right side (arrow).\n\n【42】Figure 2. Upper limbs radiograph， lateral view.

The report of MRI (with-out contrast) was as follows (Figure 3)： “MR scan with axial and sagittal T1/T2/GE/W images are obtained. Abnormal high signal intensity is seen on biceps and all superficial and deep muscles of the forearm. Considerable subcutaneous edema is noted on the arm， elbow， and forearm. Bone marrow signal， joint spaces， and great arteries are normal. Superficial veins are collapsed. Triceps muscle seems to be intact. As a conclu-sion， the findings are compatible with arm and forearm poly-myositis mainly in biceps.\"\n\n【45】Jalali Z. et al：\n\n【46】Table 1.

Right： There is remarkable subcutaneous and muscular edema in T1 (asterisk).\n\n【49】Figure 4. Second MRI (with contrast) conducted 2 weeks after the first MRI is significant for extensive edema centered on biceps， decreased signal intensity of biceps muscle on T1Wl， edematous subcutaneous fat layers， and unremarkable bone marrow. Presence of nonhomogenous enhancement is noted after DTPA injection， which is suggestive of necrosis. Necrotic area in biceps muscle has failed to enhance with contrast(arrow).\n\n【50】Meanwhile， orthopedic consultation was performed， which led to a dry aspiration. A second sonography was requested， in which echogenicity of left biceps was remarkably enhanced and the muscle and subcutaneous fat layer were edematous， but no collections could be found. The biceps muscle showed hyperemia as well. Based on sonographic findings， hematoma and fluid collections were ruled out， and the radiologist Ssus-pected space-occupying lesions or inflammatory myositis of the biceps muscle. The patient’s clinical condition showed lit-tle change. A second MRI was performed 2 weeks after first MRl， this time with contrast， and the report was as follows(Figure 4)：“The examination was performed using post-con-trast injection， which reveals the decreased signal intensity of biceps muscle on T1WI. Nonhomogenous enhancement was noted after DTPA (diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid) injec-tion. Some areas were not enhanced， probably due to necrosis. Subcutaneous fat layers were also edematous， while bone mar-row was unremarkable.\" Despite partially confusing radiologic and orthopedic consultations， misdiagnosing the case with in-flammatory or infectious myositis， we firmly withheld antibi-otic therapy in the absence of any findings supporting an in-fectious process. We also ruled in the diagnosis of myonecrosis\n\n【51】based on final MRI findings and avoided an invasive biopsy. As a result of supportive treatment with analgesics and gly-cemic control， swelling of the arm improved within a month， as expected of pathologically proven cases of myonecrosis.\n\n【52】Discussion\n\n【53】Ischemic myonecrosis is a remarkable yet overlooked diagnosis and mostly affects poorly controlled diabetics. It was initially in-troduced in 1965 \\[1\\]. Myonecrosis needs to be high on the list of differential diagnoses offered for any diabetic patient with spontaneous painful swelling of limbs \\[1\\]. The definitive diag-nosis of non-infectious myonecrosis is often challenging， and many patients first require multiple testing to exclude more com-mon differentials \\[2，3\\]. Despite its controversial pathophysiology， atheroembolism being superimposed on a diabetic’s already dis-eased small vessels is the one mostly argued about \\[2\\]. However， no atheromatous plaques have been detected on histopathol-ogy slides obtained from living tissues or postmortem exami-nations \\[1\\]. While the contribution of arteriosclerosis obliterans to ischemic myonecrosis is one of the widely agreed upon un-derlying pathologies， development of compartment syndrome is also thought to exacerbate the existing ischemia \\[2\\]. Clotting cascade or fibrinolytic pathway abnormalities be partly responsi-ble， but no substantial evidence has been found to support \\[2，4\\].\n\n【54】In contrast to our case， the typical clinical presentation of myo-necrosis is thought to involve the medial aspect of the ante-rior thigh， followed by the medial compartment of the thigh and hamstrings \\[1\\]. Unlike our case， history of narcotics use， fever， trauma， or bedridden states are usually present \\[2，5\\]. MRI is by far the best modality used for the diagnostic eval-uation of myonecrosis， as it is sensitive and offers the addi-tional advantage of noninvasiveness \\[2\\]. Display of high-inten-sity signals on T2 and notable muscular edema extending to the adjacent hypodermal fat and peripheral connective tissue are characteristic findings on imaging \\[1，6\\].\n\n【55】Some physicians take the risk of delayed healing and sec-ondarily imposed infections into account and argue for the adequacy of MRI， calling for bypassing the so-called crite-rion standard of biopsy unless evidence of other diagnosis is found \\[2\\]. However， biopsy of the involved tissue is practiced by some physicians， so that necrosis and arteriosclerosis can be viewed \\[2\\]. In the absence of a solid consensus regarding myonecrosis on the one hand， and the profoundly infrequent clinical encounters with the disease on the other hand， clini-cal management of diabetic myonecrosis used to be a matter of debate \\[2\\]. Our case is consistent with the bulk of studies in support of believing in MRI's adequacy for diagnosis， espe-cially in the absence of evidence of ongoing infectious or in-flammatory processes \\[1\\].\n\n【56】Myonecrosis represents an abysmal control of diabetes. Establishing the diagnosis of myonecrosis is firm evidence of how severe the underlying vascular disease has already be come， and these patients， independent of the course of myo-necrosis， have an increased vulnerability to serious complica-tions of micro- and macrovascular nature \\[7\\]. Multiple studies assessing the natural history of patients with diabetic myo-necrosis have found that ischemic necrosis is a strong pre-dictor of future cardiovascular morbidity and mortality \\[1，8\\]. Patients with complete resolution of myonecrosis have an in-creased risk of both fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke and an elevated risk of death due to cardiovascu-lar causes \\[6，8\\]. The occurrence of diabetic myonecrosis could be a cardiovascular disease risk equivalent， and these patients may benefit from aggressive risk factor modification for pre-vention of associated macrovascular causes of morbidity and mortality \\[1，2，9\\]. The treatment for non-infectious myone-crosis is supportive. However， patients whose glycemic con-trol is poor enough to result in ischemic myonecrosis require extensive workup of the vital organs supplied by a hitherto impaired circulatory system \\[2，9\\]. If it remains unattended， they are prone to sustain further multiple organ injuries \\[2，9\\]. Ischemic myonecrosis and vascular complications of diabe-tes are thought to share some similar mechanisms， which is why patients are required to undergo thorough evaluations for end-organ damages promptly after the resolution of myo-necrosis \\[1，10\\]. Unfortunately， our case was not an exception to the rule， and despite satisfactory resolution of myonecro-sis in response to supportive therapy with analgesics， the ul-timate result was dramatic. Aggressive glycemic control to de-lay life-threatening complications of underlying diabetes was of little success. She sustained a fatal myocardial infarction1 year after her discharge， in a course similar to that of most of patients with myonecrosis， who die after discharge due to the complications of long-standing diabetes \\[2\\]\n\n【57】References：\n\n【58】1\\.

A 51-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed as carcinoma of the pancreatic head and he underwent a pylorus-ring preserving pancreatoduodenectomny. The pathological diagnosis was IMT. The imtnunohistochetnical examination revealed that although the p53 protein test was negative， tests for alpha-smooth muscle actin， desmin， and vimentin were positive in spindle cells. A majority of spindle cells in this tumor also stained for neuron specific enolase and S-100 protein. Strong positive immunostaining for the d- and B-integrin subunits， interleukin-1 receptor type I， the nuclear factor-kappaB p65 subunit and proliferating cell nuclear antigen was found in a majority of the spindle cells. These immunohistochemical results suggested the possibility that the IMT in this patient had a malignant.\n\n【11】Conclusions：\n\n【12】This case gave us some difficulty， and the correct diagnosis of the pancreatic tumor was valuable. To diagnose the malignant potential of this type of tumor accurately may have value to direct the appropriate therapeutic operations after surgery and postoperative progress observation.\n\n【13】Key words：\n\n【14】inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor · pancreatic neoplasms· integrins · interleukin-1receptor typel·immunohistochemistry\n\n【15】Full-text PDF： http：//www.crcpr-online.com/pdf/vol\\_6/8269.pdf\n\n【16】Word count： 3337\n\n【17】Tables：\n\n【18】2\n\n【19】Figures：\n\n【20】2\n\n【21】References：\n\n【22】37\n\n【23】Author's address：\n\n【24】Hirozumi Sawai， MD， PhD Department of Gastroenterological Surgery， Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences， Kawasumi 1， Mizuho-cho， Mizuho-ku， Nagoya 4678601， Japan，e-mail： cb8h-swi@asahi-net.or.jp\n\n【25】Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMTs) are un-usual solid tumors that are composed of a variety of inflammatory or other mesenchymal cells， and the nosology and clinical behavior of IMTs are not well understood \\[1， 2\\]. IMT occurs frequently in the lung， and similar lesions have been reported in a variety of organs \\[2-6\\]. IMT of the pancreas is extremely rare，and only thirty cases have been reported so far. Although the histopathologic nature of IMT is benign， it can be difficult to differentiate from a malignant tumor because of its local invasiveness and its tendency to recur. In ad-dition， it may present as a complicated mass， resulting in a diagnostic dilemma \\[7\\]. Recent reports concerning malignant transformations of IMTs and lymphoreticular malignancies arising in the residual IMT necessitate a careful review of this entity \\[2， 8\\].\n\n【26】We have previously reported that integrins， as well as the interleukin-1 receptor type I (IL-1RI)， are over-expressed in human metastatic pancreatic car-cinoma cells， and are very significant participants in the invasive and metastatic ability of carcinoma cells \\[9， 10\\]. Moreover， we previously reported that the co-expression of integrins and IL-1RI in pan-creatic tissue suggested the existence of malignant diseases111.\n\n【27】We present here our experience with IMTs along with a review of the literature， in order to delineate the clinicopathologic features of this rare entity during diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore， we report im-munohistochemical analyses in order to investigate the feature of this tumor.\n\n【28】CASE REPORT\n\n【29】A 51-year-old Japanese man was referred to our hospital for the evaluation of a 5.0-cm mass that was\n\n【30】detected in the head of the pancreas by ultrasono-graphy performed in a nearby hospital. He had no particular symptoms. The laboratory data including tumor makers taken upon admission were within normal limits. Abdominal ultrasonography imaging revealed a high echoic solid mass associated with cystic components in the pancreas head. Non-en-hanced computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a solid/cystic， 4.0-cm diameter lesion that showed heterogeneous enhancement on enhanced CT (Figure1A and 1B). Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopan-creatography (ERCP) revealed an exclusion of the common bile duct adjacent to the mass and dilata-tion of the main pancreatic duct. Digital subtrac-tion angiography (DSA) demonstrated a serrated deformity and a contraction of the arterial wall of the posterior inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery， also next to the mass. After receiving a diagnosis of carcinoma of the pancreatic head， the patient underwent a surgical resection involving a pylorus-ring preserving pancreatoduodenectomy (PpPD). At the time of operation， the tumor was confined to the head of the pancreas without invasion to the adjacent organs. No metastatic foci were found in the liver or other organs. The tumor was removed successfully and the patient's postoperative recovery\n\n【31】was unremarkable.\n\n【32】Materials and methods： Immunohistochemical analyses were performed on formalin-fixed，paraffin-embedded blocks. Tissues were studied using the labeled streptavidin biotin method with the primary antibodies listed in Table 1. Specimens were sectioned into 3.5-um slices and deparaffinized. After rinsing in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2)， 10% bovine serum (Wako， Osaka， Japan) was applied for ten minutes to block nonspecific binding. Sections were then incubated with the primary antibodies. After rinsing in phosphate-buffered saline， sections were treated with biotinylated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit\n\n【33】Figure 1. (A) Plane computed tomography (CT) revealed a low density， heterogeneous solid/cystic lesion that was occurring from the uncinate process of pancreas (arrows).

After rinsing in phosphate-buffered saline， sections were treated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (Dako， Copenhagen， Denmark) for ten minutes. The peroxidase reaction was visualized by incubating the sections with 0.02%3，3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride in 0.05M Tris buffer (pH 7.6) with 0.01 %hydrogen peroxide， followed by hematoxylin counterstaining. Negative control sections were prepared using normal mouse immunoglobulin G instead of a primary antibody.\n\n【38】Pathological findings： The resected mass measured5.0x 4.0x4.0 cm. Its cut surface was an elastic， hard and whitish mass with a cystic lesion. The margin of the tumor was clear. Histopathologically， the tumor was composed of a focal proliferation of atypical myofibroblastic cells mixed with chronic inflamma-tory cells， including lymphocytes， histiocytes， and plasma cells (Figure 2A).\n\n【39】Immunohistochemically， the spindle cells showed diffuse strong reactivity for alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)， desmin， and vimentin. A majority of spindle cells in the IMT also stained positive for neuron specific enolase (NSE) and S-100 protein. Strong positive immunostaining for the a-integrin(Figure 2B) and Bi-integrin subunits， IL-1RI(Figure 2C)， the nuclear factor-kappaB p65 subunit， and PCNA was found in a majority of spindle cells.\n\n【40】Most spindle cells in the tumor were negative for CD34， which highlighted the irregular network of small blood vessels. The lesions were negative for c-kit， Ki67， and factor VIII. Immunoreactivity against p53 was negative in the tumor cells.\n\n【41】Clinical course： The patient's postoperative course was uneventful and he was discharged 46 days after surgery. No evidence of recurrent disease was noted during the follow-up period of six years.\n\n【42】DISCUSSION\n\n【43】Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors， commonly referred to as inflammatory pseudotumors， were initially proposed in 1990 by Pattinato et al. \\[12\\] in their study of inflammatory lesions of the lung. Various nomenclatures have been introduced to describe this condition， such as plasma cell granuloma， inflammatory pseudotumor， fibroxanthoma， and histiocytoma. Given the radiologic similarities to malignant neoplasms， the low index of clinical suspicion， and the variability of the histologic appearance， a misdiagnosis of malignancy may readily be made. The occurrence of an IMT in the pancreas is a rare event， with only 30 cases recorded in the literature to date. In this study， we survey these31 cases of pancreatic IMTs， as well as the present case， and we review their clinical features (Table 2)\\[13-36\\]. Furthermore， we analyze the present case\n\n【44】immunohistochemically in order to investigate the features of the pancreatic IMTs.\n\n【45】IMTs of the pancreas have occurred in patients from the age of 2 years to 82 years， with an average presentation age of 43.4 years. The most common clinical presentation of IMT in the lung or abdomen is a mass that is discovered incidentally \\[2\\]. However， pancreatic IMT patients have experienced symptoms including abdominal pain， a palpable abdominal mass， jaundice， weight loss， and anemia. The tumor was located in the pancreatic head in 21 (65.6 %) of the patients and in the pancreatic body or tail in eight(25.0%) of the patients. The maximum diameter of the tumors ranged from 1.5 to 12 cm (median， 5.1 cm). The pancreatic IMTs tended to be detected as larger masses than those found in the lung \\[11\\]， and this may explain why most of the pancreatic IMT patients showed obvious symptoms. Twenty-six of the 32 patients underwent pancreatic resection， and five patients underwent only exploration and biopsy. In 23 of the 26resected patients， surgical treatment removed all traces of symptoms. However， in one patient， as there was a local recurrence after the pancreaticoduodenectomy， the remnant pancreas was subsequently removed \\[20\\]. In another patient， an IMT of the lung was detected\n\n【46】Figure 2.

IMT is a benign or low-grade malignant lesion with a potential for recurrence and persistent growth of the clinical features in patients with extrapulmonary IMT according to the review by Coffin et al. For these patients， the recurrence rate was approximately25% after excision \\[1， 2\\]. This high recurrence rate was accounted for by the difficulties encountered in radical surgical treatment， because most of the tumors were close to， or involved with， important organs. Recurrence was occasionally fatal， while some patients survived for a long time after the recurrence \\[1， 32\\]. Therefore， for the management of IMT patients， Coffin et al. recommended surgical excision and careful clinical follow-up， without radical treatment with chemotherapy or radiation 2\\].\n\n【48】Based on our review of these reports， we decided to use immunohistochemical methods to investigate the characteristics of the pancreatic IMT. The d6-and Bi-integrin subunits and the IL-1RI protein， which we previously described as being overexpressed in human metastatic pancreatic cancer cells 9\\]， were strongly expressed in the spindle cells.

Blood stream infections and urinary tract infections are the most common clin-ical presentations， but other sites of infection may be involved as well.\n\n【23】Case Report： We describe a case of invasive salmonellosis caused by Satmonetta typhimurium involving the chest wall in a73-year-old man. The patient had suffered from gastroenteritis followed by left basal pneumonia with pleural effusion 7 weeks before. The CT scan of the chest wall showed a pericostal abscess with shirt-stud morphol-ogy near the left last cartilaginous arch. The abscess was surgically drained and patient was cured after a 40-day ciprofloxacin treatment.\n\n【24】Conclusions： A review of the literature on extra-intestinal non-typhoid salmonellosis shows that pleuropulmonary and soft-tissue infections are uncommon. We argue that non-typhoid Salmonetta might be considered as a possible cause of chest wall abscess in individuals with recent history of gastroenteritis complicated by pneumonia and pleural effusion.\n\n【25】Key words： Salmonella ·infection ·soft-tissue ·chest wall\n\n【26】Full-text PDF http：//www.amjcaserep.com/download/index/idArt/889546\n\n【27】Non-typhoid Salmonella (NTS) can cause not only self-limited acute gastrointestinal infections， but also bacteremia with or without extra-intestinal focal infections. Such complications usually develop in children， or in adults with predisposing con-ditions or underlying diseases that compromise host defens-es. Here， we describe a case report of an unusual site of NTS infection in a patient with diabetes mellitus.\n\n【28】Case Report\n\n【29】A 73-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for left chest pain， diarrhea， and fever. His past medical history was remark-able for hypothyroidism， arterial hypertension， and insulin-de-pendent diabetes mellitus. Seven weeks before the hospital admission， the patient had gastroenteritis followed by left bas-al pneumonia with pleural effusion. At that time， he received a 2-week regimen of amoxicillin/clavulanate and seemed to be eventually cured.\n\n【30】At hospital admission， physical examination was unremark-able except for a pasty and floating swelling， 4 cm in diame-ter， on the left side of his fifth intercostal space. Blood exami-nations were normal except for neutrophil leucocytosis (white blood cells 16 560/mm3-normal values 4000-10 000 /mm：neutrophils 13 910/mm3- normal values 2000-7500/mm3) and elevation of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimen-tation rate (ESR) (142.1 mg/L - normal value <5 mg/L-and99 mm/h， respectively).\n\n【31】Chest X-ray showed a small left basal consolidation with lit-tle concomitant pleural effusion， while CT scan of the thorac-ic wall (Figure 1) showed an 8x5 cm abscess with sand-glass morphology near the last cartilaginous arch on the left， with-out signs of bone involvement. Percutaneous incision of the lesion revealed the abscess was extending into the endotho-racic space through a perforation of the intercostal muscles. The culture from the drained pus was positive for Salmonella typhimurium， which was sensitive to fluoroquinolones and tri-methoprim-sulfamethoxazole， but was resistant to ampicillin. Treatment with ciprofloxacin by intravenous route was given， with clinical improvement. After 20 days， culture of swab from the chest wall lesion was negative， the chest wall breach was surgically sealed， and antibiotic therapy switched to oral cip-rofloxacin for a further 20 days because of the persistence of fever. At 2-month follow-up， the chest X-ray showed a near-ly total resolution of the lesion and pleural effusion， and the patient was fully recovered， with no evidence of disease per-sistence or recurrence.\n\n【32】Discussion\n\n【33】NTS are gram-negative bacilli of the family of Enterobacteriaceae， which can be acquired from multiple animal reservoirs. Human transmission occurs by many routes， including consumption of food animal products， especially eggs， poultry， undercooked meat and dairy products， fresh produce contaminated with ani-mal waste， contact with animals or their environment， and con-taminated water \\[1\\]. Salmonellosis may present in different clinical forms， ranging from asymptomatic chronic carrier to\n\n【34】Figure 1. (A) Chest CT scan showing a pericostal mass in the left anterior chest wall.

In recent years， several case series of NTS infection with extra-intestinal localizations have been reported in many countries(Table 1) \\[2-10\\]. Among the extra-intestinal localizations of NTS， blood stream infections are the most common， representing the94.3% in a case series in the USA between 1996 and 2006 \\[2\\] and 82% in a Danish case series of 135 patients observed be-tween 1991 and 1999 \\[3\\]. Other reported extra-intestinal local-izations of NTS include： urinary tract infection， endovascular in-fection and endocarditis， meningitis， osteomyelitis， pneumonia， and soft-tissue and other visceral involvement. Pneumonia， with or without pleural empyema， and soft-tissue abscesses represent uncommon complication of NTS infection， accounting for 10%\\[4\\] and from 3.7% \\[3\\] to 7.3%\\[5\\]， respectively， of extra-intestinal fo-cal infections. To the best of our knowledge， chest wall abscess-es caused by non-NTS have been reported only in 6 patients be-tween 1990 and 2011： 4 of them had no underlying disease or predisposing condition \\[11-14\\] and 2 patients had AIDS \\[15，16\\].\n\n【45】typhimurium caused the gastroenteritis and， by blood stream spread， pneumonia and pleural effusion.

Atrioventricular (AV) nodal ablation and cardiac pacing is the standard of care in refractory congestive heart failure (CHF) due to AF with moderate to rapid ventricular response that failed conventional medical therapy.

Poorly controlled ventricular rate associated with AF leads to tachycar-dia-induced left ventricular dysfunction mainly due to relative myocardial ischemia and subsequent depressed contractility， activation of the sympathetic nervous system， renin-angioten-sin system activation， and depletion of high-energy phosphate stores \\[2\\]. In patients refractory to optimal medical therapy for rate control， atrioventricular (AV) noda! ablation with per-manent pacemaker (PPM) implantation is an effective strate-gy for symptomatic relief \\[2\\]. Maintenance of controlled ven-tricular rate helps to avoid frequent exacerbations of CHF and tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy， and is also associated with improved quality of life \\[2\\]. In a study enrolling 600 pa-tients， most had restoration of LV function and even remod-eling of LV on elimination of tachycardia \\[3\\].\n\n【31】Case Report\n\n【32】Our patient was a 77-year-old woman with a history of perma-nent AF due to severe coronary artery disease (CAD) status af-ter coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Due to the history of hypertensive cardiovascular disease and permanent AF with moderate to rapid ventricular response， the patient suffered from recurrent CHF exacerbations and reduced ejection frac-tion of 30%. She presented to the Emergency Department with worsening shortness of breath and increased palpitations for1 day. She had no other associated symptoms. On examina-tion， she was afebrile， with blood pressure of 108/55 mmHg， respiratory rate 20/min， and irregular radial pulse with varying rate of 100-150 bpm. Her clinical symptoms were consistent with CHF with associated jugular venous distention of 9 cm of H，O， positive hepato-jugular reflux， bibasilar faint crackles on auscultation， and bilateral pitting pedal edema up to the level of the mid-shin. Her 12-lead EKG revealed AF with ventricular rate ranging from 75 to 143 bpm (Figure 1) despite therapy with large doses of calcium channel blockers， beta-blockers，\n\n【33】Figure 2. Chest X-ray revealed vascular congestion and dextrocardia. (Note the right sided aortic arch with the apex in the right hemi-thorax and higher left sided hemi-diaphragm).\n\n【34】and digoxin. Her chest x-ray showed vascular congestion and dextrocardia (Figure 2) and this could be compared with her chest X-ray 1 month prior to admission (Figure 3). Brain na-triuretic peptide was elevated to 2539 pg/mL， while troponin I was negative and her electrolytes were normal. She was a poor candidate for pulmonary vein isolation because of her permanent AF status and high risk of recurrence. She under-went AV nodal ablation and cardiac pacing to control recurrent episodes of AF with rapid ventricular rate， which had resulted in tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy and refractory CHF. Complete AV block was achieved after application of 2 radio frequency energies over the anatomic AV node. A PPM was programmed to WIR at the rate of 90 bpm (Figure 4). Within24 h after ablation， her shortness of breath dramatically im-proved (Figure 5). She was discharged home on warfarin， meto-prolol succinate， lisinopril， spironolactone， and furosemide.\n\n【35】Figure 5. Chest X-ray showing significant resolution of pulmonary vascular congestion after placement of pacemaker.\n\n【36】Figure 4. Atrial-sensed ventricular paced rhythm after AV nodal ablation and PPM placement.\n\n【37】AF is the most common cardiac dysrhythmia， and its prevalence is increasing， with 5.6 million U.S citizens expected to be af-fected by the year 2050 \\[4\\]. The lifetime risk of developing AF between 40 and 95 years of age was 26% in men and 23% in women， as reflected in the Framingham Heart Study \\[5\\]. Studies have shown that the most common cardiovascular reason of mortality in AF is heart failure， followed by stroke and other systemic embolizations \\[6\\]. One of the causes of recurrent CHF is tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. In some patients with AF， ventricular response cannot be controlled， likely because of greatly enhanced AV nodal conduction. Conventional med-ical therapies， including beta-blockers， non-dihydropyridine\n\n【38】calcium channel blockers， digoxin， and anti-arrhythmic drugs， may fail to control the ventricular rate. To avoid enhanced AV node conduction， ablation was done in our case and ventric-ular rate control was achieved by cardiac pacing. AV nodal ab-lation was found to be effective for rate control in 97.4% of646 patients in the 1998 NASPE Prospective Catheter Ablation Registry \\[7\\]， while in the Ablate and Pace trial， this procedure was successful in 155 out of 156 patients \\[8\\]. AV nodal abla-tion is also extremely effective in alleviation of symptoms and improvement of quality of life due to uncontrolled AF. This was evident in our case as well. In a study of 107 patients， AV nod-al ablation significantly reduced physician visits (5 vs. 10 prior to ablation)， hospital readmissions (0.17 vs. 2.8 prior to abla-tion)，and CHF exacerbation (8 vs. 18 prior to ablation) \\[9\\]. A\n\n【39】meta-analysis of 21 studies including 1181 patients showed significant improvement in 19 different measures evaluated， including ventricular function， exercise capacity， quality of life， and healthcare use \\[10\\]. However， despite improvement in symptoms and quality of life， studies have failed to reveal any positive impact on overall survival. In a study conduct-ed at the Mayo Clinic， 350 patients who underwent AV nodal ablation and PPM placement did not have better 3-year sur-vival \\[11\\]. With ventricular pacing， there is evidence of ven-tricular dyssynchrony and hence some electrophysiologists prefer biventricular pacing， but in our case， the patient want-ed a simpler approach， with an understanding that a cardiac pacing device upgrade could always be done. Furthermore， in the absence of standard data on biventricular pacing in dex-trocardia patients， a single-chamber pacemaker was the saf-er option in our case.\n\n【40】Patients with AV nodal ablation need to have a functioning PPM placed prior to the ablation procedure， and its choice gener-ally depends on the patient's clinical profile. In patients with chronic atrial fibrillation， a single-chamber ventricular pace-maker is sufficient. In these patients， ventricular rate does not respond to increased demand. Thus， as evident in our case， rate-adaptive programming (e.g.，WIR) is used. Patients with paroxysmal AF have an intact AV synchrony during periods of sinus rhythm； therefore，dual-chamber pacemakers are used(e.g.， DDDR). These devices almost always have automatic mode-switching capabilities to prevent rapid ventricular pac-ing during periods of AF. In some patients， there have been\n\n【41】References：\n\n【42】1\\.

The heart is commonly involved， especially in primary (AL) and transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis. Most patients present with restrictive cardiomyopathy along with other systemic features of amyloid deposition. Diagnosing amyloidosis is cumbersome and based on the patient's clinical condition and findings from electrocardiog-raphy， routine laboratory tests， cardiac biomarkers， imaging， and biopsy. Echocardiography (echo) is a widely available diagnostic imaging method that can help raise suspicion of cardiac amyloidosis (CA) if novel param-eters of systolic dysfunction are used， which are based on strain measurement complemented with traditional morphologic and hemodynamic traits. A definitive diagnosis of amyloidosis requires biopsy. It is important to differentiate between AL and ATTR amyloidosis because the treatment approaches for them differ. The prog nosis for CA is still dismal but can be improved with early diagnosis and institution of treatment.\n\n【19】Case Report： Our patients presented with advanced heart failure and subtle clinical signs of amyloidosis. AL amyloidosis was diagnosed based on echo findings and confirmed with bone marrow biopsy. In this report， we describe classic nonspecific echo signs followed by novel parameters of systolic dysfunction.\n\n【20】Conclusions：\n\n【21】Because the symptoms and signs of amyloidosis are nonspecific， the diagnosis requires a high level of clini-cal suspicion. Severe diastolic heart failure should prompt a further search for subtle signs on echo that indi-cate possible amyloid deposition disease. Use of systolic strain analysis increases the specificity of echo for diagnosis of amyloidosis. Echo results combined with specific clinical symptoms and results of a hematology workup can be used to diagnose CA when other， less common tests are not available or invasive testing is not desirable.\n\n【22】MeSH Keywords： Amyloidosis · Cardiomyopathy， Restrictive · Echocardiography\n\n【23】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/926290\n\n【24】￥ 2001 盟1 山音9 目日25\n\n【25】Amyloidosis is the general term for a clinical condition caused by accumulation of different precursor proteins with unstable tertiary structure clumping into insoluble amyloid fibrils， which leads to dysfunction in various organs \\[1\\]. Cardiac involvement is crucial， because when present， it is a marker of disease se-verity and indicator of prognosis. The 2 most common causes of clinically relevant cardiac amyloidosis (CA) are light chain amyloidosis (AL)， also called primary amyloidosis， and trans-thyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) \\[2，3\\]. AL amyloidosis is a primary plasma cell disorder that occurs on its own or in association with multiple myeloma \\[4\\]. Immunoglobulin light chains have an additional direct toxic effect on myocytes； therefore， the clini-cal presentation is more severe than in ATTR amyloidosis \\[5，6\\].\n\n【26】The median age at diagnosis of amyloidosis is 64 years，and two-thirds of cases are in men \\[7\\]. ATTR amyloidosis results from deposition of the abnormal transport protein transthyre-tin， mainly in the heart and peripheral nerves. The 2 subtypes are wild-type ATTR and mutant ATTR. Wild-type ATTR CA has been increasingly recognized as a cause of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in elderly individuals and will prob-ably become the most common form of CA in that population.\n\n【27】Differentiating between AL and ATTR CA is crucial because the prognosis and therapy for them are completely different \\[8\\]. Diagnosis is based on identifying clinical signs of cardiac and extracardiac involvement and on results of laboratory tests， electrocardiography (ECG)， and echocardiography (echo) in all patients with clinical suspicion of CA. A definitive diagnosis of amyloidosis (especially the AL subtype) requires histologi-cal confirmation and typing of the amyloid precursor on tissue biopsy. A biopsy of the clinically involved organ is not always necessay because most patients can be diagnosed based on analysis of an abdominal fat pad aspirate or biopsy of a mi-nor labial salivary gland. Cardiac biomarkers (N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide \\[NT-proBNP\\]and troponin) are cru-cial for diagnosing cardiac involvement. They can be positive even before symptoms occur， have prognostic significance， and increasingly are being used to monitor disease progres-sion and response to treatment. Echo is the mainstay of diag-nostic imaging because of its wide availability and reproduc-ibility \\[2\\]. Numerous classic and novel echo signs are relatively specific for CA and the testing also offers prognostic informa-tion \\[2，9\\]. Additional tests， such as magnetic resonance imag-ing (MRI)， scintigraphy with bone tracers， and genetic analy-sis， can be performed on an individual basis and depending on their availability. Early diagnosis is the determinant of prog-nosis， especially in AL amyloidosis， for which antineoplastic therapy should be administered as soon as possible \\[4\\]. The amyloidosis subtype and disease stage determine the strate-gy for treatment， which can include chemotherapy， stem cell\n\n【28】transplantation (SCT)， and liver transplantation \\[4\\]. We present the cases of 3 patients with advanced heart failure who were diagnosed with AL amyloidosis based on their clinical presen-tation and results of echo， laboratory testing， and bone mar-row biopsy. We also discuss the echo parameters for diagno sis of the disease and assessment of prognosis.\n\n【29】Case Report\n\n【30】Patient 1 was admitted for newly diagnosed heart failure with high levels of natriuretic peptides and chronically elevated tro-ponin values (Table 1). During standard treatment， he had ex-perienced transitory aphasia without structural cerebral dam-age and recovered completely. ECG showed low voltage in the limb leads with a pseudoinfarction pattern in the precordial leads (Figure 1). That finding along with the patient’s clinical presentation (periorbital hematoma， thickened tongue， pro-teinuria below the nephrotic range， and a decreased glomer-ular filtration rate) and echo findings (Figure 2) were highly suspicious for amyloidosis.\n\n【31】Spontaneous echo contrast was detected in the man's heart cavities， possibly explaining his recent cardioembolic cerebral event despite sinus rhythm. Monoclonal protein-immunoglob-ulin G (IgG) and lambda light chains were detected on further hematological workup (serum and urine protein immunofix-ation， serum kappa/lambda free light chain \\[FLC\\] ratio). Bone marrow biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of multiple myeloma：20% CD138+ atypical plasma cells with Congo red-positive am-yloid infiltrates. Chemotherapy was started， but unfortunately， the patient died 2 months later from refractory heart failure.\n\n【32】Patient 2 also presented with a first episode of mainly right-sided heart failure (NT-proBNP 10940 ng/L). She was a sep-tuagenarian and already cachectic upon admission， with gen-eralized edema. Echo revealed advanced-stage restrictive cardiomyopathy with significant reduction in left ventricular systolic function (LVSF) and telltale signs of potential amyloi-dosis (Figures 3， 4). Upon cardiac recompensation， the patient was transferred to the Hematology Department and diagnosed with multiple myeloma (lgG， lambda light chains) with amy-loidosis based on bone marrow biopsy. Clinical and radiologic staging showed additional involvement of the tongue， kidney(proteinuria)， and liver (enlargement and infiltration on com-puted tomography \\[CT\\] scan). After 3 cycles of chemotherapy， the patient died from an ischemic stroke.\n\n【33】Patient 3 had a relatively short history of chronic heart fail-ure with a mildly reduced LV ejection fraction. She deteriorat-ed progressively despite evidence-based therapy. During her last hospitalization for worsening heart failure， a repeat echo raised suspicion for amyloidosis based on morphologic traits，\n\n【34】Table 1.

One week later， the patient had a thrombosis of the inferior vena cava with a kidney infarction. Further workup fulfilled the crite-ria for diagnosis of multiple myeloma with amyloidosis： mono-clonal lambda light chains in serum and urine electrophore-sis， bone marrow infiltration with atypical plasma cells， Congo red-positive amyloid fibers， and involvement of the heart， liv-er， kidney， and tongue. A cardiac biopsy also was performed but the result was nondiagnostic. The patient currently is re-ceiving chemotherapy in preparation for autologous SCT. The clinical and echo parameters for all 3 patients are summa-rized in Table 1.\n\n【38】AL amyloidosis is fairly rare， with an incidence of 8.9 per100 0000 and 60% of patients have cardiac involvement \\[7\\]. Our patients were initially diagnosed in a general hospital that covers a population of 120 000， so the 3 cases are a surprising-ly high incidence in a short time span of 10 months. Median time to diagnosis was 5 months， while other authors have re-ported a median of 10 to 22 months \\[10，11\\]. The small number of patients in our report does not for allow direct comparisons； nevertheless， they were all diagnosed fairly swiftly. The median age of patients with AL amyloidosis is 60， most of whom are men \\[7\\]. The diagnosis is suspected when the clinical presenta-tion includes classic findings， such as microvoltage and a pseu-doinfarction pattern on ECG (present in all 3 of our patients)\n\n【39】Figure 1. An electrocardiogram from Patient 1 showing microvoltage in the limb leads and a pseudoinfarction pattern in the precordial leads.\n\n【40】Figure 2. An echo image (apical 4 chamber view) from Patient1. The asterisk marks the myocardium of the left ventricle， which is speckled and appears to be hypertrophic.\n\n【41】Figure 3. An echo image (parasternal long axis view) from Patient 2. The left ventricle is small， the left atrium is enlarged， the valves are thickened， and there is a small amount of pericardial and plural effusion. AV- aortic valve； LA - left atrium； LV - left ventricle； MV- mitral valve； PeE -pericardial effusion； PE - plural effusion.\n\n【42】and hyperechogenic speckled myocardium on echo \\[12\\]. All of our patients had chronically mildly elevated cardiac troponin values， reflecting continuous necrosis of myocytes and signif-icantly elevated NT-proBNP values， which correlated with the clinical picture of advanced heart failure. Cardiac biomarkers are excellent parameters for monitoring disease progression，\n\n【43】staging， and determining prognosis. A widely used staging sys-tem from 2004 relied solely on 2 cardiac biomarkers： troponin(T or l) and NT-proBNP \\[13\\]. It was revised in 2012， adding the absolute difference in FLCs as a third variable \\[14\\].\n\n【44】Figure 4. A bullseye display of regional LV longitudinal strain from Patient 2. The basal regions are outermost， mid regions in the middle， and apical regions innermost. A significant reduction in longitudinal strain， with a typical“apical-sparing”or“cherry-on-top” pattern is seen.\n\n【45】Figure 5. An echo image (parasternal long axis view， M mode tracing) from Patient 3. The septum of the left ventricle and posterior wall have a layered appearance(\"onion bulb\"). A small amount of pericardial effusion is visible behind the posterior wall (asterisk). IVS -intraventricular septum； PW -posterior wall.\n\n【46】Echo done based on a high level of clinical suspicion for the pathology was the key to further workup and achievement of definitive diagnosis in our patients. Biopsy of clinically affect-ed organs or less invasive and， therefore， more widely used\n\n【47】Figure 6. An echo image (subcostal view) from Patient 3. The left and right atrium are both enlarged， the interatrial septum (asterisk) is thickened， and the wall of the right ventricle exhibits “hypertrophy.\". A liver hemangioma was an incidental finding. H-hemangioma； LA -left atrium； RA - right atrium； RV-right ventricle.\n\n【48】Figure 7. An echo image (apical 4-chamber view) from Patient3. The Doppler tracing of transmitral flow shows a restrictive left ventricular filling pattern.\n\n【49】abdominal fat pad aspirate and biopsy of a salivary gland is mandatory for the diagnosis of AL amyloidosis. All of our pa-tients had bone marrow biopsies， which showed clonal plas-ma cells consistent with multiple myeloma and amyloid infil-tration， detected by Congo red staining. One should always keep in mind the differential diagnosis between AL and ATTR amyloidosis. For instance， ATTR amyloidosis can occur with un-related monoclonal gammopathy， such as monoclonal gam-mopathy of undetermined significance， which requires follow up and no chemotherapy.\n\n【50】Peak systolic strain\n\n【51】Figure 8. A bullseye display of the regional LV longitudinal strain from Patient 3. The pattern of strain reduction is the same as in Figure 8， but less prominent.\n\n【52】Figure 9. An echo image (modified apical 4-chamber view) from Patient 3. The low tissue Doppler mitral annulus velocity and increased E/e'are consistent with restrictive cardiomyopathy.\n\n【53】In all of our patients， the diagnosis of multiple myeloma with amyloidosis was clear and performing additional routine car-diac biopsy would not have affected treatment. Scintigraphy with technetium pyrophosphate (99mTc-PYP)， which tradition-ally has been used as a bone tracer， has 100% specificity to differentiate between AL and ATTR CA， so it could be done to definitively exclude coexisting ATTR (which is highly unlike-ly) \\[8\\]. Cardiovascular MRI (cMRI) shows a typical pattern of late gadolinium ehnancement in CA， and it is suggested after echo in a CA diagnosis algorithm \\[1\\]. ATTR CA amyloidosis can even be diagnosed without biopsy. Positive scintigraphy with bone-avid tracers (Grade 2 or 3 tracer uptake) in the absence of detectable monoclonal protein in serum or urine provides\n\n【54】a reliable nonhistological diagnosis \\[15\\].Unfortunately， cMRI is still not widely available for routine use.\n\n【55】Our cases demonstrate that echo followed by a hematology workup (monoclonal protein detection and bone marrow bi-opsy) is a possible pathway to diagnosis of AL amyloidosis in a large number of patients， obviating the need for routine car-diac biopsy. Most patients with CA have relatively preserved LVSF on presentation. That makes diagnosis of CA even hard-er because most clinicians would expect isolated advanced di-astolic dysfunction \\[16\\]. Unfortunately， all of our patients had advanced disease with high amyloid burden and concomitant systolic dysfunction. When myocardial amyloid burden reach-es a certain threshold， cardiac damage is known to become ir-reversible and chemotherapy does not appear to improve out-comes \\[17\\]. Two of our 3 patients had cerebral ischemic events despite sinus rhythm. Risk for thrombosis is greatly increased with ventricular diastolic dysfunction and atrial mechanical dysfunction； therefore， anticoagulation should be considered as an option in all patients with CA \\[4，18\\].\n\n【56】Multiple studies have shown that strain abnormalities can be an early marker of CA， often before symptoms of conges-tive heart failure \\[4\\]. Most of the classic echo parameters(Figures 2， 3， 5-7， 9) are relatively nonspecific for CA \\[2，19\\]. An apical sparing pattern of longitudinal strain impairment has high sensitivity (93%) and specificity (82%) for CA \\[4，20\\]. Relative apical sparing also can be seen on 2-dimensional speck-le-tracking echo in patients with more common causes of myo-cardial thickening， such as hypertension and aortic stenosis. Additional information can be gained by analyzing dissocia-tion between relatively preserved left ventricular ejection frac-tion (LVEF) and profoundly reduced global longitudinal strain(GLS)， expressed as LVEF/GLS ratio. This parameter can also be used to differentiate CA from other causes of LV hypertro-phy. An EF/GLS ratio higher than 4.1 has 89.7% sensitivity and91.7% specificity for a CA diagnosis \\[20，21j. Our patients met these criteria. Various prognostic factors can be assessed with echo. Increased septal thickness， E/e’ratio (ratio between early mitral inflow velocity and mitral annular early diastolic veloc-ity)， and reduced LVEF all indicate worse prognosis regardless of the type of amyloidosis \\[2\\]. In patients with AL amyloido-sis and preserved LVEF， a GLS value less than-14.81 has been shown to be a predictor of all-cause mortality \\[2，23j. Basal-apex gradient of strain can be expressed as relative regional strain ratio (RRSR). An RRSR higher than 1.19 also predicts high-er mortality or progression to heart transplantation \\[2，24，25\\].\n\n【57】Conclusions\n\n【58】CA is the most common cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy and should be considered in all patietns with heart failure who\n\n【59】present with preserved LVEF. The prognosis is determined by the extent of myocardial damage and total amyloid burden. Overall， it has improved consistently because of advances in diagnosis and treatment. Now even patients with stage 4 AL CA have a median survival of 5.8 months \\[14\\]. Shorteningthe time from symptom onset to diagnosis is the key to improving outcomes. Our cases show how full use of echo in conjunction with clinical presentation，ECG， cardiac biomarkers， M protein detection， and bone marrow biopsy can sometimes provide a definitive diagnosis of CA in patients with AL amyloidosis without the need for an invasive organ biopsy. Unfortunately， technical limitations at our center did not permit us to perform\n\n【60】References：\n\n【61】1\\.

Its clinical features are unclear because of its rarity. Here， we report an autopsy case of SPCC and review CT findings and chemotherapeutic regimens based on previous reports of this disease. To our knowledge， this is the first reported case of peme-trexed used to treat SPCC.\n\n【23】Case Report： A 74-year-old Japanese male presented with dyspnea and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed abundant left pleural effusion and a mass in lower lobe of the left lung. By the tumor biopsy， he was diagnosed for SPCC of the lung， cT3N0M1a， stage IV. The tumor was resistant to chemotherapy with carbopla-tin and pemetrexed， and rapidly progressed.

Sarcomatoid carcino-ma is rare， comprising approximately 1% of all lung malignan-cies. About 75% of sarcomatoid carcinoma of the lung cases are pleomorphic carcinoma； spindle cell carcinoma reportedly accounts for 9.4%\\[1，3\\]. Because the clinical features of SPCC are unclear because of its rarity， the accumulation of the case reports is important. We here report an autopsy case of SPCC， which was seen as a mass with an internal low-density area in computed tomography (CT)； it was resistant to chemothera-py consisting of carboplatin and pemetrexed； and rapidly pro-gressed， with hemorrhage within the tumor. In addition， we review CT finings and chemotherapeutic regimens based on the previous reports of SPCC\n\n【30】Case Report\n\n【31】A 74-year-old Japanese male presented with dyspnea for two weeks. He had an 84-pack-year smoking history and had worked for the construction industry for 40 years. Also， he received gastrectomy and treated with doxifluridine because of gastric cancer at 54-year-old. Then， he had been in good condition without any comorbidities. Contrast-enhanced (CE)-CT showed abundant left pleural effusion and a mass of-85 mm in lower lobe of the left lung. The mass had a little enhancement and showed an internal low-density area， and focal thickening out-side the mass at the left pleura (Figure 1A). Interestingly， the border with the internal low-density areas inside the mass and pleural effusion was indistinct in a part.18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) showed abnormal FDG accumulation in the mass and thickening pleura； no oth-er abnormal sites were shown. The magnetic resonance im-aging (MRI) of the head showed no metastasis. Tumor mark-ers for the lung cancer were carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)：9.4 ng/mL， which was a little high； other tumor markers，includ-ing sialyl Lewis Xi antigen， squamous cell carcinoma antigen， cytokeratin 19 fragment， neuron specific enolase and pro-gas-trin releasing peptide， were within normal limits. Respiratory function test showed restrictive impairment： the vital capac-ity of the predicted value (%VC) was 51.6%， and forced ex-piratory volume in 1 second divided by forced vital capacity(FEV1/FVC ratio) was 79.5%. Performance Status defined by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group was grade 2. Oxygen sat-uration of arterial blood measured by pulse oximeter (Sp02) was 92% at room air.\n\n【32】Though the obtained pleural fluid was bloody and exudative， cytology did not reveal obvious malignant cells. Thoracentesis was performed twice more， but the results were same. A bron-choscopy showed upper and lower bronchus of the left lung were oppressed and a transbronchial lung biopsy was per-formed， but the sample showed no malignant findings. The tu-mor biopsy used with thoracoscope finally detected the malig nant lesion from thickening left parietal pleura outside of the mass. The obtained specimen contained a sarcomatoid lesion which consisted of spindle-shaped tumor cells.\n\n【33】Based on immunohistochemical findings， we diagnosed the non-small cell lung cancer including sarcomatoid carcinoma， with pleural dissemination， cT3N0M1a (PLE)， Stage IV by the7h Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) criteria. After drainage of the pleural fluid and pleurodesis used with picibanil and minocycline， chemotherapy was started within two weeks after thoracoscopic examination. The chemotherapy regimen was carboplatin (AUC 5， day 1) and pemetrexed (500 mg/m²， day 1). However， CE-CT taken 15 days after chemotherapy was initiated showed a progressive lesion with large internal low-density area (Figure 1B). In addition， SpO2 decreased gradu-ally for 3 days before death and finally went down below 80%under inhalation of 15 L/min of oxygen. The patient died of respiratory failure 19 days after starting the first cycle of che-motherapy. No hemoptysis was observed during the diagnos-tic and treatment process\n\n【34】On autopsy， the tumor was found to occupy almost all of left thoracic cavity and invaded to the pulmonary artery and vein. Inside of the mass was abundant hemorrhage， which was thought to have been the low-density area seen in the CE-CT(Figure 2A). The solid compartment of the left lung consisted of disarrayed malignant spindle cells surrounded by myxoid interstitial tissue with propagated collagen fibers (Figure 2B) and tumor cells invaded blood vessels. No epithelial compo-nent was contained. Immunohistochemical staining showed the malignant cells to be positive for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and negative for CEA， smooth muscle actin， synaptophysin， chro-mogranin-A， calretinin， thyroid transcription facter-1， Napsin-A， p63， desmin， S-100 protein， and bcl-2. Tumor cells were also positive for Ki67 (index 50%) (Figure 2C). There was no dis-tant metastatic lesion. According to the above results， the def-inite diagnosis was SPCC of the left lung， pT4N0M1a. In addi-tion， no anti-tumor efficacy of chemotherapy such as apoptotic cells was observed.\n\n【35】Discussion\n\n【36】In the present case， the tumor was resistant to chemothera-py consisting of carboplatin and pemetrexed， and rapidly pro-gressed with hemorrhage within the tumor. We searched case\n\n【37】Figure 1. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT).

Their age range was 31-74 years； four pa-tients were younger than 50 years old. Seven patients were male and five were female.\n\n【42】In general， it has been reported that smoking habit is associat-ed with development of sarcomatoid carcinoma \\[1\\]. Smoking history was described in eight of 12 SPCC patients (Table 1). Of which， Two patients were never smokers， suggesting that smoking habit is not always associated with SPCC carcinogen-esis， unlike other types of sarcomatoid carcinomas. However， more patients are needed to clarify the effect of smoking on the SPCC carcinogenesis.\n\n【43】Imaging signs for SPCC are unclear because of its rarity. The present case showed a big tumor， the inside of which consist-ed of a low-density area with indistinct border to pleural effu-sion in CE-CT， which was found to be abundant hemorrhage in autopsy. Several case reports of SPCC also present low-density areas within the tumors (Table 1) \\[2，4-6\\]. Also， in several cas-es， though low-density areas in CT were not described， speci-mens obtained by operation or autopsy showed hemorrhage and/or necrosis within the tumor \\[7-9\\]. In addition， in 9 of the12 cases， the tumor was located at the lung periphery. In pleo-morphic carcinoma， most patients (>50%) show low-density ar-eas within the tumor in CT， which reflect hemorrhage， necrosis\n\n【44】and myxoid degeneration， as confirmed by pathology \\[10，11\\]. In addition， sarcomatoid carcinoma is frequently reported to show areas of hemorrhage and necrosis， and occasionally shows cavitation \\[1，3\\]. Also， most sarcomatoid carcinomas arise pe-ripherally and rapidly progress to aggressively invade adja-cent structures such as the chest wall or the pleura \\[2，3，10，12\\].\n\n【45】The above reports， image findings for SPCC in the lung， indi-cate that it appears with an internal low-density area in CT， locates at periphery of the lung and rapidly progresses. These characteristics might be useful distinguishing SPCC from oth-er carcinomas， such as adenocarcinoma， squamous cell car-cinoma and large-cell carcinoma， in which these findings are shown less frequently. In present case， the Ki67 index was approximately 50%， which implied rapid progression， leading to vulnerability of neovessels. In addition， autopsy of present case showed tumor cell invasion to blood vessels. Thus， tu-mor rapid progression and angioinvasivity might lead to dia-thesis to easily bleed.\n\n【46】The prognosis and treatment of SPCC of the lung is also un-clear \\[2\\]. Standard treatment of inoperable sarcomatoid car-cinoma cases (including SPCC) has not been established，and many cases have been treated with chemotherapeutic regi-mens for non-small cell lung carcinoma. We selected peme-trexed because it is a relatively recent developed drug com-pared to paclitaxel， docetaxel， vinorelbine， or gemcitabine， and\n\n【47】Table 2.

To our knowledge， the present case is the first report of SPCC treated with pemetrexed. Previous case reports of SPCC (Table 2) show some patients with operable cases liv-ing a long time \\[8，9\\] and other operable cases dying and/or relapsing within a year after surgery \\[2，9，12，13\\]. In inoperable cases \\[4-7，14\\]， platinum-based chemotherapy or chemoradio-therapy was selected according to non-small cell lung carci-noma regimens (Table 2). However， the efficacy was poor and the patients died within 6 months. Interestingly， oral bis-be-tacarboxyethygermanium sesquioxide got complete response for four years， even after chemoradiotherapy \\[6\\].

The lieomyoadenomatoid tumor (LMAT) is rare and considered an adenoma-toid variant， characterized microscopically by prominent smooth muscle proliferation within an adenomatoid tumor. Areas of pseudo-glandular infiltration and tubular and slit-like spaces can mimic metastatic carcinoma or malignant tumors. Most cases of LMAT were incidentally discovered microscopically after an impression of leiomyoma. Eighteen cases have been reported in studies published in English.\n\n【23】Case Report： We present a case of a 35-year-old woman who experienced recurrent vaginal bleeding and underwent a myo-mectomy. Microscopically， the mass showed smooth muscle proliferation in fascicles with areas of tubular， slit-like spaces， and gland-like areas， which showed reactivity for Wilms tumor-1 and calretinin by an immunohisto-chemistry study. The final pathology examination showed a 9-cm LMAT， which is the largest size ever reported to the best of our knowledge. There was no recurrence or other symptoms at the 2-year follow-up.\n\n【24】Conclusions：\n\n【25】An LMAT should be considered in the differential diagnosis of leiomyomas that present areas of pseudo-infil-trative glands and slit-like spaces， which can lead to misdiagnosis as a malignant tumor.\n\n【26】Keywords： Adenomatoid Tumor·Leiomyoma·Neoplasms， Mesothelia\n\n【27】Ful-text PDE https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/934012\n\n【28】1010 十1 山增日\n\n【29】2\n\n【30】119\n\n【31】1 Department of Laboratory Medicine & Pathology， King Abdula ziz Medical City Jeddah， Saudi Arabia2 Department of Laboratory Medicine & Pathology.

This type of tumor was initially discovered by Sakaguchi in 1916and was called adenomyomata before Golden et al renamed the condition as “adenomatoid tumor\"\\[2，3\\]. The microscopic features include the presence of hypertrophied smooth muscle bundled in areas exhibiting anastomosing tubular， gland-like， vascular-like， or cystic branch morphologies. However， when the smooth muscle is exceedingly prominent and gives the appearance of leiomyoma within the AT， the lesion is then re-ferred to as a leiomyoadenomatoid tumor (LMAT) \\[4\\]. Clinically， LMAT is considered an incidental finding during hysterectomies or leiomyoma diagnosis\n\n【33】It is important to recognize these tumors because the promi-nence of smooth muscle in this particular gland-like structure can mimic features of malignancy.\n\n【34】We report the case of a 35-year-old woman with an LMAT in-cidentally found in her uterus， which was mistaken for a dif-ferent kind of tumor and was therefore removed as a uterine fibroid. The diagnosis was challenging due to the presence of cribriform gland-like morphology infiltrating the smooth muscle.\n\n【35】Case Report\n\n【36】A 35-year-old woman arrived at the Obstetrics and Gynecology clinic with concerns for lower abdominal pain. The pain started3 months previously， was characterized by intermittent occur-rences， and was usually managed with regular analgesia. No constitutional symptoms were recorded. The patient's men-strual history was regular； however， 7 months prior to her pre-sentation， her menses became heavy and was associated with severe lower abdominal pain. During the physical examination， the patient appeared conscious， oriented， and alert. Her vital signs were within the standard ranges. The abdominal exam-ination revealed a soft and lax abdomen with no masses or tenderness. Other systemic examinations were unremarkable. The initial investigation， which consisted of a complete blood count， blood electrolytes， and hepatic function tests， were all within the standard ranges. A radiological study was conduct-ed， including an ultrasound， revealing multiple uterine fibroids. Based on the clinical and radiological findings， a myomecto-my was performed， and the specimen was sent for histopa-thology examination.\n\n【37】On gross examination， multiple well-circumscribed white-tan pieces were noted， and the largest piece measured 9.0x3.0x2.5cm. The others measured in aggregate 3.0x2.0×0.5 cm. The outer surfaces of all pieces were smooth and characterized by\n\n【38】Figure 1. The gross examination， showing a well-circumscribed mass with a white-gray cut surface and whorled appearance.\n\n【39】trabeculae， white-tan firm surfaces， and a whorled appearance. As shown in Figure 1， no necrosis or hemorrhage was seen.\n\n【40】The microscopic testing uncovered bundles of smooth muscle arranged in fascicles separated by well-vascularized connec-tive tissue. The cells were elongated with eosinophilic cyto-plasm and distinct cell membranes. A gland-like， tubular， and slit-like structure infiltrated the smooth muscle. Those struc-tures were lined by a flattened cuboidal lining with small and uniform nuclei and contained a scanty and eosinophilic cyto-plasm， as illustrated in Figure2A-2D. The mitosis was rarely less than 3 per 10 high-power fields. No necrosis was observed. Immunohistochemistry revealed diffuse strong staining to the calretinin and D2-40， as displayed in Figure 2E-2F； low-molec-ular-weight cytokeratin (CK7)； wide-spectrum CKs； and a neg ative reaction to CK20， endothelial antigens (CD31)， and Ki 67， which revealed a low proliferative index (<3%). The smooth muscle component expressed positive activity in reaction to smooth muscle actin. A follow-up appointment 3 months af-terward showed the patient was doing well， with no signs of recurrence or malignant transformation.\n\n【41】Discussion\n\n【42】An AT is a benign tumor that arises from mesothelial cells \\[4\\]. ATs commonly form in organs covered by mesothelial linings， such as the genital tract， and therefore mainly occur in the testis and uterus \\[4\\]. Extra-genital sites， particularly in the or-gans closed to serosal membranes (eg， pleura， peritoneum， and pericardium)， the adrenal gland， and other visceral organs can be involved \\[5\\]. An AT is usually located subserosally in\n\n【43】Figure 2. Histopathology examination by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemistry studies. (A-C) Examination revealed prominent smooth muscle with a gland-like area infiltrated between (H&E 4x， 10x). (D) High-power examination of the gland-like areas reveals a gland lined by a flattened cuboidal lining with small and uniform nuclei and scanty and eosinophilic cytoplasm (H&E； 40x). (E) D2-40 reveals diffuse staining in a gland-like structure (40x). (F) Calretinin reveals diffuse staining in a gland-like structure (40x).\n\n|  | Author， Year  | Age  | Sex  | Location  | Size  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1.  | Amre et al \\[5\\]  | 52  | Female  | Anterio-lateral wall of the uterus  | 2.5cm  |\n| 2.  | Erra et al \\[6\\]  | 44  | Female  | Anterior uterine wall  | 3cm  |\n| 3.  | Hong et al \\[8\\]  | 24  | Female  | Posterior wall of the uterus and right ovary  | 4cm  |\n| 4.  | Mathew et al \\[9\\]  | 51  | Female  | Posterior wall of the uterus  | 3cm  |\n| 5.  | Amerigo et al \\[10\\]  | 55  | Female  | Posterior wall of the uterus  | 2.5cm  |\n| 6.  | Dobrosz et al \\[11\\]  | 57  | Female  | Posterior wall of the uterus  | 3.5cm  |\n| 7.  | Pransgaard et al \\[7\\]  | 24  | Female  | Cervico uterine junction  | 3cm  |\n| 8.  | Sarma et al \\[12\\]  | 54  | Female  | Posterior wall of the uterus  | 2cm  |\n| 9.  | Bahuguna et al \\[13\\]  | 65  | Female  | Uterus， intramural  | Multiple 3.5-0.5 cm.  |\n| 10.  | Bedir R et al \\[14\\]  | 51  | Female  | Uterus， intramural  | Two 1.5-2cm  |\n| 11.  | Ersavaset al \\[15\\]  | 30  | Female  | Uterus， intramural  | 4.5cm  |\n| 12.  | Ranjan et al \\[16\\]  | 36  | Female  | Uterus， intramural  | Multiple 0.5-3.0 cm  |\n| 16.  | Ranjan et al \\[16\\]  | 40  | Female  | Uterus， intramural  | 2cm  |\n| 14.  | Ranjan et al \\[16\\]  | 43  | Female  | Uterus， intramural  | 1.2cm  |\n| 15.  | Junainah et al \\[17\\]  | 45  | Female  | Uterus  | Multiple 2.0-0.5 cm  |\n| 16.  | Koufopoulos et al \\[18\\]  | 76  | Female  | Antero-lateral wall of the corpus uteri  | 2.5cm  |\n| 17.  | Adorno et al \\[19\\]  | 38  | Female  | Uterus， intramural  | 3.8cm  |\n| 18.  | Adorno et al \\[191  | 26  | Female  | Uterus， intramural  | 3.3cm  |\n| 19.  | Present case  | 35  | Female  | Uterus， intramural  | 9cm  |\n\n【45】the posterior wall near the uterine cornu and is < 4 cm in size. Previous studies have mentioned the association between leio-myomata and adenomyosis \\[5，6\\].\n\n【46】The microscopic description of the AT shows an intersecting hypertrophied smooth muscle with unremarkable nuclei with-in a slit-like cystic area as well as glands infiltrating between the muscles lined by round to cuboidal cells. Those cells ex-press immunoreactivity for Wilms tumor-1， calretinin， CK AE1/AE3， and CK7， as in our case.\n\n【47】Differential diagnosis is not uncommon in cases of AT Ow-ing to various histological patterns， as mentioned previous-ly. These include leiomyoma， angioleimyoma，leiomyoma with malignancies， malignant mesothelioma， yolk sac tumors， and metastatic adenocarcinoma. AT can mimic leiomyoma or ma-lignant tumors infiltrating smooth muscle when smooth mus-cle is prominent， thus concealing the AT component. This type of tumor， the LMAT， was described by Epstein in 1992 and is\n\n【48】considered a variant of the AT with a prominent smooth mus-cle component \\[4\\]. In the present case， the first impression was a metastatic tumor infiltrating the smooth muscle， which made it challenging to reach the diagnosis of LMAT.\n\n【49】After a review of the available studies published in English on PubMed，Ovid， and Google Scholar， we found only 18 cases that were diagnosed as LMATs， as shown in Table 1 \\[5-19\\]. One was in the cervico-uterine junction \\[7\\]， 1 was in the ovary \\[8\\]， and the remaining 16 cases， in addition to ours， were discovered in the uterus. The patients' ages ranged from 24 to 76 years， and the size of the tumors ranged from 1.5 to 4 cm. However， the size of the tumor in our case was 9 cm， which was the larg-est tumor so far， to the best of our knowledge. We found only1 other case in Saudi Arabia， reported by Junainah et al \\[16\\]， and our case is the second reported in the country.\n\n【50】We conducted a literature review on LMATs and reported a case study of a female patient with this condition. An LMAT was found incidentally in the patient's uterus. We recommend that if the leiomyoma has prominent smooth muscles， LMAT should be considered in the differential diagnosis to avoid be-ing mistaken for an invasive malignancy.\n\n【51】References：\n\n【52】1\\.

Despite its dreaded nature， nearly one-third of ACS present without chest pain and may mislead clinicians. Additionally， Wellens' syndrome is a pre-infarction stage of significant proximal left anteri-or descending (LAD) artery stenosis， which can lead to extensive anterior wall myocardial infarction without timely intervention.\n\n【21】Case Report： We report the case of a 74-year-old woman presenting with isolated throat pain and Wellens’pattern in the initial EKG， which prompted the proper workup and management. Subsequently， coronary angiogram revealed more than 90% occlusion of the proximal LAD artery and a drug-eluting stent was deployed. The patient did well after the procedure and the follow-up at 2 weeks after discharge was uneventful.\n\n【22】Conclusions：\n\n【23】This case highlights the importance of awareness of atypical presentation of ACS and importance of Wellens’syndrome. We also discuss the incidence of craniofacial symptoms of ACS， and the epidemiology， pathophysi-ology， management， and prognosis of Wellens’ syndrome.\n\n【24】MeSH Keywords：\n\n【25】Acute Coronary Syndrome· Neck Pain· Asymptomatic Diseases· Percutaneous Coronary Intervention· Diagnostic Techniques， Cardiovascular\n\n【26】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/907992\n\n【27】Typical chest pain in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is pres-sure-like left-sided chest pain， possibly with radiation to the left shoulder/arm and associated dyspnea， nausea/vomiting， diaphoresis， or lightheadedness. However， ACS can present with no or atypical symptoms， which can lead to delayed di-agnosis and suboptimal treatment， and subsequent detrimen-tal outcome， especially in elderly patients \\[1-3\\]. Additionally， Wellens'syndrome is abnormal T wave changes in patients with suspected ACS， indicating significant occlusion of the proxi-mal left anterior descending (LAD) artery \\[4\\]. Herein， we report the case of a 74-year-old woman who presented with isolated throat pain and was found to have Wellens' syndrome and ACS.\n\n【28】Case Report\n\n【29】A 74-year-old woman with diabetes， hypertension， dyslipid-emia， and hypothyroidism presented with a 3-week history of intermittent throat pain. She denied any chest pain， dyspnea， lightheadedness， nausea/vomiting， or stomach/back pain. She also denied any known coronary artery disease. Her home medications are metformin， vitamin B12， enalapril， atorvas-tatin， and levothyroxine. Her vital signs were stable and phys-ical exam results were negative， including cardiac and pulmo-nary exam. Of note， the patient was completely asymptomatic at the time of evaluation. The initial electrocardiogram (EKG) showed T wave inversions over right precordial leads (Figure 1)， which were new compared to prior EKG 2 years ago (Figure 2). Initial troponin was 0.9 ng/ml， which went up to 1.7 ng/ml 6h later. The patient was treated with aspirin， clopidogrel， ator-vastatin， carvedilol， and protocol-based heparin infusion for\n\n【30】non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient was admitted to the coronary care unit for close monitor-ing. Subsequently， a coronary angiogram showed more than90% stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending artery(LAD)， for which a 2.5×12 mm Xience drug-eluting stent was deployed， with good flow (Figure 3). The patient tolerated the procedure and was discharged with standard medical thera-py. Follow-up 2 weeks later showed favorable outcome with-out recurrent events.\n\n【31】Discussion\n\n【32】ACS is a common and potentially life-threatening condition en-countered at emergency departments (ED). Despite its dread-ed nature， 33% of ACS may mislead clinicians with atypical presentations \\[1\\]， which could be dyspnea (49.3%)， diaphore-sis (26.2%)， nausea/vomiting (24.3%)， or presyncope/syncope(19.1%)， in the order of dominant presenting symptoms \\[2\\]. The atypical symptoms tend to occur more commonly among those who are older， female， diabetic (possibly due to auto-nomic neuropathy)， hypertensive， and with prior heart fail-ure. They were reported in 5.7% and 12.3% of patients with unstable angina and NSTEMI， respectively \\[2\\]. Consequently， they delay the correct diagnosis and optimal therapy， with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. As would be expected， because of the frailty and comorbidities， elderly populations are more likely to have complications of ACS， especially when they present without chest pain \\[3\\].\n\n【33】Craniofacial pain is the sole presenting symptom in 6% of pa-tients with an ischemic cardiac event， and it is 4 times more frequent than stomach and back pain \\[5\\]. Craniofacial pain is\n\n【34】Figure 2. Prior EKG 2 years ago， showing normal sinus rhythm without significant T/ST changes.\n\n【35】A B\n\n【36】Figure 3. Coronary angiogram showing more than 90% proximal LAD stenosis (A) and status-post stent with restoration of good flow in the LAD (B).\n\n【37】a referred pain from the afferent vagal nerve of the heart to efferent somatic nerves to the head and neck \\[5，6\\]. It is also more prevalent in women than in men. The throat is the most common site of craniofacial pain. Other sites of referred pain are the mandible， temporomandibular joint， ears， neck， and teeth \\[5\\]. Hiccups， a rare presenting symptom， was reported in a patient with PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention)-related STEMI \\[7\\].\n\n【38】First reported by Zwaan et al. in 1982， Wellens’ syndrome is a pre-infarction stage of significant proximal LAD artery ste-nosis and may lead to extensive anterior wall myocardial\n\n【39】infarction without timely intervention \\[4，8\\]. It was reported in26%(35/137) of patients with suspected coronary artery dis-ease (CAD) undergoing coronary angiogram \\[9\\]. T wave chang-es in Wellens’ syndrome are associated with widely scattered electrical and mechanical activities (QTc dispersion) in myo-cardium and severe myocardial dysfunction \\[9\\]. Wellens’ syn-drome can be identified as 2 patterns on EKG \\[8\\]：\n\n【40】·Pattern A has biphasic T waves in V2-V3 (25%)and\n\n【41】·Pattern B has symmetric and deeply inverted T waves in chest leads (75%).\n\n【42】The diagnostic criteria for Wellens' syndrome includes the pres-ence of pattern A or pattern B in EKG plus a history of angi-na， pain-free period， little or no elevation of ST segment， no Q waves in chest leads， and normal or minimal elevation of car-diac enzymes \\[4，10\\]. The T wave inversion has 69% sensitivity，89% specificity， and 86% positive predictive value for signifi-cant LAD occlusion \\[11\\]. Even in the challenging situations with pre-existing left bundle branch block (LBBB)， Wellens'EKG pat-terns can be used to detect acute coronary syndrome \\[12，13\\].\n\n【43】The differential diagnoses of T wave inversions are acute cor-onary syndrome (ACS)， pulmonary embolism， myocarditis， left ventricular hypertrophy，juvenile T wave， Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome， and digoxin toxicity \\[14\\]. Unlike the regular practice in patients with possible ischemic chest pains， cardiac stress testing is contraindicated in Wellens' syndrome patients be-cause it can precipitate acute myocardial infarction \\[9\\]. When Wellens' sign is discovered in patients with suspected ACS， a low threshold should be maintained for prompt coronary an-giography to determine treatment options \\[4，8，9\\]. If there is significant proximal LAD occlusion， percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary bypass surgery should be per-formed to prevent extensive anterior myocardial infarction. When solely managed with medical therapy， 75% of Wellens’syndrome patients developed extensive anterior wall infarc-tion within 1 week \\[8\\].\n\n【44】References：\n\n【45】1\\.

Given the risk factors (age， sex， diabetes， dyslipidemia， and hypertension) and concern for ACS， routine EKG was done， which showed Wellens' pat-tern B. Notably， she was asymptomatic when the EKG was per-formed. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with NSTEMI and underwent PCI. After discerning the Wellens'sign， we were able to provide correct diagnosis and optimal management.\n\n【56】Conclusions\n\n【57】In conclusion， craniofacial pain can be the sole presentation of ACS， of which throat pain is the most common symptom. It can be a diagnostic challenge for clinicians， mandating a low threshold of clinical suspicion for ACS. The presence of Wellens' sign in the EKG can be a crucial clue in patients with atypical presentation of ACS. Therefore， it is imperative for clinicians to identify the EKG characteristics of Wellens’ syn-drome and provide necessary tests and appropriate interven-tion. Medically treated LAD stenosis with Wellens' syndrome eventually requires coronary intervention to prevent re-occlu-sion and extensive myocardial injury \\[8，15-17\\].\n\n【58】Conflict of interests\n\n【59】None.\n\n【60】9\\.

Mostly it occurs along the duo-denum in the paraduodenal recesses. The patient might be misdiagnosed as having obstruction secondary to strictures formed as a result of intestinal tuberculosis and pose delay in exploration.\n\n【22】Case Report：\n\n【23】We describe an adult patient who presented with intestinal obstruction by a toumiquet or ring formed between the tip of appendix and ileocecal junction through which small bowel herniated， strangulated and finally perfo-rated before exploration， initially thought to be due to intestinal tuberculosis. He underwent exploratory lapa-rotomy and was release of obstruction， appendectomy and resection of bowel. The patient tolerated the pro-cedure well and discharged in stable condition.\n\n【24】Conclusions：\n\n【25】Intestinal obstruction due to internal hernia is rare in adults. Computed tomography abdomen can diagnose the condition； however， exploration of the abdomen can give the definite diagnosis and tailor the appropriate therapy.\n\n【26】MeSH Keywords： Appendix · Intestinal Obstruction·Laparotomy\n\n【27】Ful-text PDE https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/920384\n\n【28】口1020 十\n\n【29】十十 ￥16\n\n【30】Internal hernia has an overall incidence of less than 1%， it con-stitutes up to 5.8% of small bowel obstructions， which， if left un-treated can lead to high mortality rate exceeding 50% if stran-gulation is present \\[1，2\\]. Very few cases have been reported in the literature in which internal herniation occurred through a tourniquet or ring formed by the adhesions of the appendic-ular tip to ileocecal region or to the base entrapping loops of small bowel resulting in acute intestinal obstruction. Intestinal obstruction secondary to appendiceal pathology is quite un-common \\[3-6\\]. We report the case of an adult who presented with acute intestinal obstruction and found to have appen-dicular tourniquet and internal herniation of small bowel \\[7\\].\n\n【31】Case Report\n\n【32】This case report is of a 24-year-old male patient with no co-morbidities or previous abdominal surgery， who presented with3 days of colicky abdominal pain in the peri-umbilical area as-sociated with projectile vomiting and anorexia. He was ob-stipated for 2 days although there was no history of nausea， rigors， or weight loss and this was the first time to have this presentation. He was treated for pulmonary tuberculosis and the therapy ended 2 months ago.\n\n【33】He was conscious， alert， and not in pain. His vitals were with-in normal limits. His abdomen was mildly distended， with no scars， with mild tenderness on right lower quadrant but with-out rebound tenderness. There was no sign of peritonitis. His bowel sounds were audible. Digital rectal examination revealed empty rectum， however， no mass or bleeding was appreciated. Nasogastric tube aspirated around 150 mL of greenish fluid.\n\n【34】Blood works showed a white cell count of 11.6 (range，4000-7000) and hemoglobin was 13.7 g/dL (range， 12-16 g/dL) whereas biochemistry was normal. X-ray abdomen (Figure 1) at the time of presentation showed multiple air fluid levels with no air under diaphragm. Computed tomography (CT) abdomen and chest with oral and intravenous (Ⅳ) contrast showed (Figure 2) dilatation of the small bowel loops to the level of the distal ileum， suggestive of small-bowel obstruc-tion， and multiple enlarged， mesenteric， retroperitoneal/para-aortic and peripancreatic necrotic lymph nodes suggestive of tuberculosis with tuberculous lymphadenitis. The patient was admitted as a case of intestinal obstruction and started on I fluids and nasogastric decompression， with the impression of obstruction secondary to intestinal tuberculosis. He was ex-amined serially every 4 hours for development of any new signs and a repeat abdominal x-ray that was performed after12 hours (Figure 3) showed free air under diaphragm. A mid-line laparotomy was performed， about 1.5 L of hemorrhagic\n\n【35】Figure 1. Abdominal x-ray showing multiple air fluid levels.\n\n【36】Figure 2. Computed tomography abdomen with contrast showing dilated jejunum with non-progression of contrast.\n\n【37】fluid and bowel contents were evacuated from the abdominal cavity. The small bowel was distended till the ileocecal junc-tion and tip of appendix was attached to ileocecal valve form-ing a tourniquet/ring around the loop of small intestine caus-ing complete obstruction. lleal perforation was seen 80 cm proximal to ileocecal junction， at mesenteric border， around1 cm in diameter with dusky dilated small bowel (Figure 4). Appendectomy was done after releasing the tip from the ileo-cecal valve and resection of the ileum bearing the perforation with side to side anastomosis with stapler was accomplished.\n\n【38】Figure 3. Abdominal x-ray showing free air under diaphragm.\n\n【39】Figure 4. White arrow cecum， Yellow arrow appendix forming a ring， Blue arrow ileum loop herniating through appendicular ring.\n\n【40】Histopathology of small bowel segment revealed submuco-sal edema， hemorrhage， serositis with granulation tissue for-mation， consistent with perforation， whereas the appendix showed only peri-appendicitis. The postoperative course was complicated by superficial wound infection which was treat-ed at the hospital and discharged home. He was doing well at 1 and 4 weeks of follow up at the clinic.\n\n【41】Discussion\n\n【42】Internal hernia is a rare cause of intestinal obstruction so a high index of suspicion should be kept in mind specially in young healthy patients with no previous history of abdominal surgeries. There are no radiological features sensitive or spe-cific for internal hernias \\[7\\]. The main types of internal hernia as traditionally described by Meyers \\[8\\] are based on location. Specifically， using historical data， these consist of paraduode nal (53%)， pericecal (13%)， foramen of Winslow (8%)， trans-mesenteric and transmesocolic (8%)， intersigmoid (6%)， and retroanastomotic (5%) with the overall incidence of internal hernias being 0.2% to 0.9%\\[7\\].\n\n【43】Hotchkiss first described 3 cases of intestinal obstruction re-lated to appendiceal cause in 1901 \\[9\\]. Soo and Tsegha \\[10\\] and Makama et al. \\[3\\] have classified intestinal obstruction due to appendix into the paralytic ileus， mesenteric ischemia， obstruction without strangulation， and lastly the mechanical occlusion by strangulation， and the first case was published by Naumov \\[11\\] in 1963. Appendicular tourniquet is the for-mation of a ring/loop by the adhesion of its tip to ileocecal junction secondary to inflammation. To date， 17 cases have been described in literature by Ismail \\[16\\] and Chowdary \\[6\\]. Adhesion of the appendicular tip are formed by the inflam-mation of appendix itself or may result from peritoneal re-action \\[10\\]. X-ray abdomen can be helpful in diagnosing in-testinal obstruction but CT scan can provide further details regarding site and sometimes the causative lesion but in this rare entity of appendicular tourniquet the definite diagnosis can only be made on exploring the abdomen as happened in our patient \\[11\\].\n\n【44】Laparoscopic exploration is becoming the standard of care in cases of intestinal obstruction as it is safe， effective， and ad-vantageous over open surgery \\[12，13\\]. Benefits offered by laparoscopy are less pain， good postoperative outcomes， less morbidity， lower chances of post-operative ileus and early discharge \\[12\\]， although it may not be appropriate for all pa-tients as there is less working space in distended bowel and more chances of bowel injury and morbidity in addition to advanced laparoscopic skills \\[14\\]. Exploratory laparotomy re-mains the choice in all the cases where laparoscopic surgery cannot be performed although now it is becoming less com-mon \\[15\\]. Release of obstruction， appendectomy and/or resec-tion of dead bowel remain standard of care after exploration either open or by laparoscopy \\[3-6，9-11\\].\n\n【45】Conclusions\n\n【46】Internal hernia by appendiceal tourniquet/ring is extremely rare. Diagnostic dilemma can arise due to past history of pulmonary\n\n【47】tuberculosis. The patient present with sign and symptoms of intestinal obstruction and high index of suspicion should be kept in patients with no prior surgical history. Treatment is by exploration either by laparoscopy or open surgery， release of obstruction， appendectomy with or without bowel resection.\n\n【48】References：\n\n【49】1\\.

One of its well known complications is angle closure glau-coma (increased intraocular pressure secondary to physical-ly obstructed anterior chamber angle) \\[1，2\\]. It is debatable whether prophylactic treatment for spherophakia is neces-sary or if treatment should only be performed in symptom-atic patients \\[1\\]. We describe an 18-month-old child with bilateral spherophakia complicated by an acute on chron-ic angle closure glaucoma in the right eye. To our knowl-edge， this is the youngest child to be reported with pupillary block secondary to anterior lens dislocation in spheropha-kia. The left eye showed multiple iris atrophic holes that might indicate previous attacks of angle closure， and which might have helped to lessen the severity of a similar attack in the left eye. It seems that early intervention with lensec-tomy and anterior vitrectomy allows for adequate control of the intraocular pressures in patients with spherophakia.\n\n【23】CASE REPORT\n\n【24】An 18-month-old male was referred to our clinic for man-agement of known spherophakia. He had previously been managed with spectacle correction of-24 D sphere in each eye. According to his mother， he was evaluated by an oph-thalmologist 2 months before， who prescribed Timolol 0.5%eye drops twice daily in both eyes for intraocular pressures of 28 mmHg and 26mmHg.\n\n【25】On examination， he was able to maintain an unsteady but cen-tral vision in both eves. He had an esotropia of 40 prism diop-ters (PD) at near and distance， which decreased to 25 PD with his current prescription. He had coarse right horizontal nys-tagmus. Using chloral hydrate sedation， his anterior segment exam revealed bilateral clear comeas， with corneal diameters of 13.00mm horizontally and 12.50mm vertically in the right eye， and 13.25mm horizontally and 12.75mm vertically in the left eye. His right conjunctiva was injected. Before dilatation， the right lens was anteriorly displaced in the shallow anteri-or chamber (Figure 1). The anterior chamber of the left eye was also shallow， with multiple atrophic iris holes (Figure 2). Cycloplegic refraction was - 34 D sphere in the left eve， but was not obtainable for the right eye. His intraocular pressures measured 41 mmHg and 28 mmHg using Perkins tonometer(Haag-Streit， USA). Both posterior poles were normal， with a0.2 cup to disc ratio. Gonioscopy was not done for the patient. He had normal external features and normal limbs. Pediatrics consult to rule out any systemic associations was negative. The patient took Acetazolamide tablets (25 mg/kg/day in 4 divid-ed doses and was scheduled for surgery in 2 days).\n\n【26】Under general anesthesia his right cornea was clear and in-traocular pressure measured 15mmHg and 8mmHg. Upon intraocular manipulation， the lens was repositioned to its anatomical position. Four hours of zonular dehiscence (3-5and 9-11) were noticed. An uneventful right eye lensecto-my with planned anterior vitrectomy was performed. He was kept on Timolol 0.5% BID to the left eye. After discussing the risks， benefits and alternatives with the parents， they chose to\n\n【27】Figure 1. Anteriorly dislocated Intraocular lens， lens is dlearly seen in the right anterior chamber immediately before performing surgery.\n\n【28】Figure 2. Left eye showing multiple atrophic iris holes.\n\n【29】proceed with a left lensectomy and planned anterior vitrec-tomy l week later， which was uneventful. Following recovery， his exam revealed bilateral clear corneas and deep anterior chambers. Retinoscopy yielded a refractive error of +13.00 D in the right eye and +12.25+1.25 axis 180 in the left eye. His intraocular pressure was 8mmHg and 7mmHg 2 weeks after the second operation. One year post-surgery there were no complications， he was off antiglaucoma treatment， and was wearing +11.00 D with a +3.00 DS near addition in both eyes.\n\n【30】DISCUSSION\n\n【31】Chronic angle closure glaucoma secondary to spherophakia with frail zonular fibers has been reported in several ethnic-ities (Japanese， Indian， Nepalese， Australian， etc) \\[1，2，4\\]. This is the first case to be reported from the Jordanian population. After literature review， this appears to be the youngest child to present with secondary glaucoma follow-ing ectopia lentis. Spherophakia has also been reported in borderline cases of Weill-Marchesani syndrome with ab-sence of some clinical features of the disorder \\[1\\]. It also oc-curs in Marfan’s syndrome， Alport’s syndrome， Klinefelter's syndrome， hyperlysinaemia and congenital rubella \\[4-6\\].\n\n【32】Multiple mechanisms have been discussed to explain the mechanism of angle closure in patients with spherophakia.\n\n【33】These included pupillary block via a spherophakic lens with weak zonules with or without dislocation into the anterior chamber， blockage of the angle by a dislocated lens， irritation of the ciliary body by a dislocated lens， or associated congeni-tal or acquired anomalies of the trabecular meshwork \\[1，3-7\\]. In the first and second decades of life， pupillary block in dis-orders with lens abnormalities is a well known association\\[71.\n\n【34】In our case， the presence of a dislocated crystalline lens in the anterior chamber and the high IOP made our manage-ment decision easier. Following stabilization of the intraoc-ular pressure， a lensectomy was promptly conducted. The peripheral iris atrophy in the left eye may have acted as pe-ripheral iridotomies to limit the pupillary block.\n\n【35】It is debatable whether prophylactic treatment for spheropha-kia is necessary or if treatment should only be performed in symptomatic patients \\[1\\]. Furthermore， there is controversy over whether lensectomy alone is enough to control glauco-ma in spherophakia patients. Dagi \\[6\\] and Willoughby \\[8\\] be-lieved that lensectomy is enough to control intraocular pres-sure in such cases if performed in a timely fashion. Asaoka\\[1\\] suggests that trabeculotomy may be necessary to control intraocular pressure in spherophakia. Yasar \\[9\\] needed 2 tra-beculectomies in the right eye and l in the left eye， follow-ing bilateral lensectomy，anterior vitrectomy and peripheral iridectomy， to control intraocular pressure in a 16-year-old girl over 5 years of follow-up. Although lensectomy will re-lieve pupillary block， it may not control intraocular pressure in the presence of extensive peripheral anterior synechiae.\n\n【36】Peripheral iridotomies or iridectomies may be good tem-porary measures to control the intraocular pressure until the time of surgery \\[3，8，9\\]， although this is challenging in the pediatric population.\n\n【37】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【38】We assume that prompt intervention with lensectomy and anterior vitrectomy allowed for adequate control of the in-traocular pressures.\n\n【39】Literature search\n\n【40】A MEDLINE literature search from 1995 to present using the key words “microspherophakia\"， “Weill-Marchesani syn-drome\"and\"pupillary block\" was completed to look for re-ports on childhood pupillary block， microspherophakia and pediatric subluxated lens management.\n\n【41】Acknowledgement\n\n【42】The authors thank Ghada Abdel-Hafez， MD， Albert Florens Storm Eye Institute， Medical University of South Carolina， Charleston， SC for help with review.\n\n【43】REFERENCES：\n\n【44】1\\.

For recovering the normal extensibility of the capsule in individuals with adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder， passive stretching of the capsule through end-range mobilization has been suggested. Recently the concept of joint mobilization into angular joint mobilization (AJM)， which is rotational joint mobilization with joint axis shift， was proposed. This case report aimed to investigate the immediate effect of AJM on pain， range of mo-tion (ROM)， and disability in a patient with shoulder adhesive capsulitis.\n\n【27】Case Report：\n\n【28】The patient was a 53-year-old woman who was diagnosed with left shoulder adhesive capsulitis. Her left shoul-der gradually stiffened， affecting functional activity. The patient attended 12 joint mobilization sessions over a period of six weeks (two times per week). The intervention consisted of rotary oscillations of the left shoulder， which were applied with overpressure and stops before the end of the pathological limit. After intervention， the patient reported 3/100 pain intensity on the visual analogue scale (VAS) (before versus after： 58 versus 3). Active ROM improved by 51 in flexion， 76.4°in abduction， 38.7° in external rotation， and 51.4° in active inter-nal rotation. Passive ROM improved by 49° in flexion， 74.6°in abduction， 39.4° in external rotation，51.4° in in-ternal rotation. The total shoulder， pain and disability index (SPADI) score improved by 53.9%.\n\n【29】Conclusions：\n\n【30】The patient reacted positively to AJM， resulting in improved shoulder pain， ROM， and disability， and the results suggest that AJM allow consideration in the management of individuals with adhesive capsulitis.\n\n【31】MeSH Keywords： Adhesive Capsulitis · Case Reports ·Restraint， Physical · Shoulder Joint\n\n【32】Abbreviations： AJM - angular joint mobilization； ROM -range of motion； SPADI -shoulder pain and disability index\n\n【33】Full-text PDF http：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/900858\n\n【34】目名\n\n【35】12\n\n【36】2 9 8 1 2 山音6 138\n\n【37】Adhesive capsulitis， also referred to as frozen shoulder， is a common disabling but self-limiting condition from progres-sive fibrosis and ultimate contracture of the glenohumeral joint capsule. The condition is associated with pain， limited range of motion (ROM)， sleep deprivation， anxiety， and disabil-ity that may be hugely disruptive and impact nearly every as-pect of daily living and occupational activities of an individu-al \\[1-5\\]. The average duration of the condition is 30.1 months(range 1 to 3.5 years) but it may be substantially longer， and the burden placed upon individuals and healthcare services may therefore be considered substantial \\[5\\]. However， the eti-ology for primary adhesive capsulitis remains unknown \\[1，2\\]. Preferentially women 30-60 years old are affected， but it can occur in patients of any age \\[6\\]. The prevalence of primary ad-hesive capsulitis is reported to affect 2% to 5.3% of the gen-eral population and secondary adhesive capsulitis related to diabetes mellitus and thyroid disease is reported to be be-tween 4.3% and 38% \\[7\\].\n\n【38】Traditionally， for recovering the extensibility of the shoul-der capsule in individuals with adhesive capsulitis， passive stretching of the shoulder capsule in all planes of motion by end-range mobilization has been suggested \\[8，9\\]. These ap-proaches have been described in the literature \\[9-11\\]. Based on these approaches， physical therapists have used an anterior glide of the humeral head to improve external rotation ROM， according to the convex-on-concave concept of joint surface motion \\[11-13\\]. In this manner， with the glenohumeral joint as a ball-and-socket joint coupled to Kaltenborn convex-concave rule， mobilization for the glenohumeral joint were introduced in which roll and glide occurred in the opposite direction. In spite of that， this approach has never been validated by in tra-articular kinematic studies， and supporting clinical data is lacking. In addition， particularly， more studies are in contrast with Kaltenborn convex-concave rule \\[14-27\\].\n\n【39】Johnson et al. suggested that a posteriorly directed joint mo-bilization was more effective than Kaltenborn convex-concave based on anteriorly directed mobilization for improving exter-nal rotation ROM in individuals with adhesive capsulitis. This approach can be based on the capsular constraint mechanism where the tight capsule caused humeral head translations in the direction opposite to the tightened region \\[25\\]， however， this capsular constraint mechanism is also debatable \\[29-32\\].\n\n【40】Baeyens et al. suggested redefining mobilization techniques for the glenohumeral joint in terms of rotation of the humer-us and translation of the geometrical center of the humeral head \\[18\\]. Based on this background， the authors theorized that joint restriction was due to impaired rotation with possi-ble joint axis shift impairment of the rotary motion joint. And\n\n【41】then， the authors revised the idea of joint mobilization and named it angular joint mobilization (AJM)， which is rotation-al joint mobilization with joint axis shift. However， no stud-ies have investigated the possibility of this approach in indi-viduals with adhesive capsulitis. Thus， this case report aimed to investigate the immediate effect of AJM on pain， ROM， and disability in a patient with adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder.\n\n【42】Case Report\n\n【43】Patient history and systems review\n\n【44】The patient was a 53-year-old woman， right hand/arm domi-nant， with a height of 160.02 cm and weight of 54.43 kg. Her symptoms began approximately seven months before being seen for an evaluation for physical therapy. She was referred to physical therapy by an orthopedic surgeon who diagnosed her with left shoulder adhesive capsulitis. Aside from taking meloxicam， the patient was not taking any other medications. There was no history of manipulations under anesthesia or sur-gery. She reported tripping， but reached out with her left arm to avoid the fall (mild trauma)， while walking in her garden. She experienced a sudden sharp pain in her shoulder， which worsened a few days later after she accidentally hit her left shoulder on a door lock. Her left shoulder gradually stiffened， affecting her functional activity. She spent most of her time in the garden to grow vegetables. She had never experienced any shoulder pain before. During her visit to her primary care physician or orthopedic surgeon， radiography revealed no ab-normalities/fracture and degenerative joint disease. She had nephrolithiasis previously and， at the time of the initial physical therapy evaluation， reported no other health problems. Further screening showed no signs or symptoms indicative of a possi-ble underlying serious pathology including cervical disc disor-ders/radiculopathy， shoulder dislocation/subluxation， muscle power deficits/rotator cuff syndrome， and tendonitis/bursitis. The patient complained of constant pain in her left shoulder. This pain awakened her approximately four or five times per night while lying on the left side and with position change. The patient's goals for physical therapy were to return to her previous level of function such as washing her back， resum-ing household chores including putting items on the top shelf， carrying a bag of fertilizer， and growing vegetables.\n\n【45】Examination\n\n【46】The patient initially received a physical therapy evaluation that showed shoulder pain and limitations to active and pas-sive ROM in flexion， abduction， external and internal rotations.\n\n【47】Shoulder pain was examined by using the visual analogue scale(VAS， 0 to 100). The patient completed the VAS questionnaire\n\n【48】before the intervention， during the intervention， and after the intervention per session at resting position.\n\n【49】Both active (AROM) and passive ROM (PROM) were measured with a goniometer. Measurements were performed in shoul-der flexion， abduction， external rotation in 57° abduction， and internal rotation in 57° abduction in both AROM and PROM. three times.\n\n【50】Within the international classification of functioning， disability and health (ICF) framework， the constructs of “activity limita-tions” and“participation restrictions\" were examined by us-ing the shoulder pain and disability index (SPADI) before and after the intervention.\n\n【51】Clinical impression\n\n【52】At the initial examination， the patient stated experiencing mod-erate levels of pain， with the VAS score being 58. Compared with the mean (SD) normative values， she had limited shoul-der AROM in flexion (111.7°； normative value，180°)，abduction(57.3°； normative value， 180°)， external rotation at 57 abduc-tion (17.0°； normative value， 70°)， internal rotation at 57°ab-duction (32.3°； normative value， 90°). In addition， she had lim-ited shoulder PROM in flexion (116.3°； normative value， 180°)， abduction (62.7°； normative value， 180°)， external rotation at57°abduction (22.3°； normative value， 70°)， and internal ro-tation at 57°abduction (34.3°； normative value， 90°). In the SPADI for testing activity limitations， the patient demonstrat-ed a pain score of 60， disability score of 72.5， and total score of 67.7. Tables 1 and 2 lists the baseline outcome measures.\n\n【53】Interventions\n\n【54】The immediate goals of the intervention strategy were to im-prove the patient's shoulder pain， and improve the limited ROM and restricted shoulder function. The patient’s long-term goal was to participate in daily activities at her previous lev-el. After the examination， direct intervention using AJM was initiated. The patient attended 12 joint mobilization sessions over a period of six weeks (two times per week for six weeks). The intervention started with an informative and explanatory session， and was applied for 20 minutes per session. To apply joint mobilization， the patient assumed the supine position comfortably. Before applying each AlM for flexion， abduction， external rotation， and internal rotation， the direction of the joint shift was identified by the therapist together with the patient's report of feeling the most joint structure stretching， lesser pain， and increase ROM. Grade lI AJM were applied on all 12 sessions， in which rotary oscillations were applied with overpressure but stopped before the end of a joint’s patholog-ical limit. Joint tissues were slack at the beginning of the arc of movement and joint stretching occurred from mid to end\n\n【55】range of the arc of movement. For flexion AJM， inferior shift was applied on the first to the sixth session (Figure 1A)； pos-terior shift was applied from the seventh to the twelfth ses-sions (Figure 1B). For abduction AJM， posterior shift was ap-plied from the first to the tenth sessions (Figure 1C)； rotational shift was applied on the eleventh session (Figure 1D)； posterior shift was applied on the twelfth session (Figure 1C). For exter-nal rotation AJM at approximately 57° abduction angle， poste-rior shift was applied from the first to the sixth sessions； infe rior shift was applied on the seventh session； posterior shift applied from the eighth to the tenth session； rotational shift applied on the eleventh session； and posterior shift applied on the twelfth session. For internal rotation AJM at approxi-mately 57° abduction angle， posterior shift was applied from the first to the twelfth session.\n\n【56】Angular joint mobilization\n\n【57】AJM has three steps. The first step is the primary joint mobi-lization. The direction is determined by the limited motion of the long lever arm going into end range with overpressure to tolerance. This is done passively but can also be active or ac-tive assisted. The second step is called the joint shift (assis-tive joint mobilization). This is sustained pressure but can also be overpressure. Joint shift includes not only glide， but also rotation， spin， compression， and distraction. The most joint structure stretching and lesser pain will determine the direc-tion of the joint shift. It does not follow the convex-concave rule as the approach plane is not parallel to the concave joint surface (not a flat surface). The third step is combined move-ment， which is used at an advanced stage.\n\n【58】Primary joint mobilization is applied at the pathological limit but stops before the anatomical limit of a joint's range of mo-tion. This technique should not produce sharp pain， even with overpressure. The primary joint mobilization grading in AJM is as follows： grade l (a painful joint) is rotary oscillations which are applied with slight overpressure at the start of the path-ological limit. Like a swinging pendulum， the joint tissues are on slack at the beginning to the mid-range and joint stretch-ing occurs toward the end the arc of movement. Grade Il is rotary oscillations which are applied with overpressure and stopped before the end of the pathological limit. Joint tissues are slack at the beginning of the arc of movement， and joint stretching occurs from mid to end of the arc of movement. Grade III (in a non-painful joint) is rotary oscillations with overpressure which are applied to the end of the pathologi-cal limit (Figure 2). The following are the three types of joint shifts： In joint shift， sustained pressure is applied at the start of accessory movement limit while primary joint mobilization is applied. In joint shift (+)， sustained overpressure is applied in between the start of accessory movement limit and end of accessory movement limit while primary joint mobilization is\n\n【59】Table 1.

At the last session， the patient’s active range of motion improved by 51° in flexion， 76.4° in abduction， 38.7°in external rotation， and 51.4° in internal rotation. In addition， the patient was reported to have an improvement of 49° in passive flexion ROM， 74.6° in passive abduction ROM， 39.4°in passive external rotation ROM， and 51.4° in passive inter-nal rotation ROM. Total pain score in SPADI improved by 46%， total disability score in SPADI improved by 58.7%， and total SPADI score improved by 53.9%.\n\n【63】The patient met almost all of her functional goals at the end of 12 intervention sessions， which were washing her back with some effort， putting light items on the top shelf， resuming house chores， carrying a bag of fertilizer， and growing vegetables. The patient had several setbacks on pain： on the fourth ses-sion because she helped at her son’s garage sale， lifting heavy items at waist level and did some gardening， and on the ninth and the twelfth session because of gardening and yard work.\n\n【64】Figure 1. (A-D) Angular joint mobilization of shoulder joint.\n\n【65】Figure 2. Grades in angular joint mobilization.\n\n【66】Discussion\n\n【67】The convex-concave rule of arthrokinematics has been widely accepted and practiced in manual therapy. The convex-concave rule is a didactic simplification of determining the direction of translatoric joint mobilization during rotatory movements of the joint \\[33\\]. Rotatory movement also referred to as ro-tary motion， in biomechanical terminology is called “angular displacement” (osteokinematic view)， which is movement of a segment around a fixed axis. However， in a human rotary\n\n【68】motion joint， all joint axes shift at least slightly during the motion \\[34\\] and joint surfaces not only glide but also simul-taneously roll on the opposite joint surface (arthrokinematic view) \\[12\\]. Kaltenborn hypothesis (convex-concave rule) sug-gests that a restricted joint movement (i.e.，hypomobility) is due to impaired joint gliding \\[11\\]. However， when joint roll-ing occurs without its associated gliding， the instantaneous axis of movement shifts to an abnormal location \\[11\\]. If this joint movement occurs based on Kaltenborn theory， then roll-ing will lead to dislocation， but dislocation does not occur on restricted joint movement. A few studies have suggested that the direction of mobilization is controversial \\[21，33，34\\]； and more studies were in contrast with Kaltenborn convex-concave rule \\[14-23，25-27，35，36\\]. For example， the joint axis shifts superiorly rather than inferiorly in glenohumeral joint abduction movement \\[14，18，20，23，26，27，35，36\\]. In addition， Baeyens et al. suggested the need to redefine mobilization techniques for the glenohumeral joint in terms of rotation of the humerus and translation of the geometrical center of the humeral head \\[21，37\\].\n\n【69】In the arthokinematic view， a single point on the concave ar-ticular surface contacts multiple points on the convex articu-lar surface regardless of joint congruency when a convex ar-ticular surface moves on a concave articular surface， which is a simultaneous movement of roll and glide in the opposite di-rection (Figures 5， 6). In addition， a single point on the concave articular surface contacts multiple points on a convex articular\n\n【70】Figure 4. Shoulder pain pre- and post-angular joint mobilization at each physical therapy session.\n\n【71】Figure 5. Arthrokinematic rotation on incongruent joint. A) A single point on the concave surface contacts multiple points on the convex surface and B) a single point on the convex surface does not contact any other points on the concave surface.\n\n【72】surface regardless of joint congruency when a concave artic-ular surface moves on a convex articular surface which is a simultaneous movement of roll and glide in the same direc-tion. So whether it is a convex on concave or concave on con-vex joint， a single point on the concave articular surface con-tacts multiple points on the convex articular surface regardless of joint congruency， plus a single point on a convex surface contacts more points on a concave surface in a congruent joint \\[16，38\\]. This is completely different from glide， in which one point on the convex joint surface contacts new points on the concave joint surface， and from roll， in which new points on each surface comes into contact throughout the motion. This suggests that this motion is arthrokinematic rotation. For example， when glenohumeral joint abduction occurs， the gle-nohumeral center also translates superiorly. If the rotation is divided into roll and glide， then inferior glide (a component of\n\n【73】Figure 6. Arthrokinematic rotation on congruent joint. A) A single point on the concave articular surface contacts multiple points on the convex articular surface； B-1) a single point on convex surface contacts more points(compared to incongruent joint surface) on concave surface but B-2) a single point on convex surface does not contact any more points on concave surface as rotation continuously occur.\n\n【74】rotation)， and superior glide (the center of the humeral head superior shift) will conflict with each other. Even if there is de-creased gliding movement due to two opposite directions of glide and joint shift， joint movement is still rotation， as a single point on each surface contacts multiple points on the opposite surface. If the distance of the superior joint shift and inferior gliding becomes equal， then joint movement will be just roll. When gienohumeral joint abduction occurs， arthrokinematic movement is arthrokinematic rotation with glide， and osteo-kinematic movement is rotation with joint shift.\n\n【75】However， rotation is not a simultaneous movement of roll and glide at all. In order to analyze this joint movement， arthro-kinematics and osteokinematics (axis movement) have to be considered at the same time. Joint axis moves when roll or glide occurs， but joint axis does not move when rotation occurs\n\n【76】(known as a simultaneous movement of roll and glide). When a hinged door is being opened or closed， rotation occurs， but roll and glide cannot occur since the axis is fixed. Rotation is a completely independent movement from roll and glide even though combined roll and glide can mimic the movement； it still is not a true rotation.\n\n【77】Restricted joint movement is thought to have restricted gliding and predominant rolling between the joint surfaces instead of restricted rotation \\[11\\]， but it is impossible to identify which one is the restricting factor between gliding and rolling. Roll and glide are strictly two-dimensional (2-D) terms that do not include the shift along the helical axis (axis of rotation， screw axis， and twist axis) but shifts along it \\[21\\].\n\n【78】Based on this background， authors have theorized that joint restriction is due to impaired rotation with possible joint axis shift impairment of the rotary motion joint， and this impaired rotation with possible joint axis shift impairment might be from not only impaired passive subsystem (ligaments， bursas， cartilages， meniscoids， joint surfaces， joint capsules， etc.) but also from the active (muscles， tendons) and control subsys-tem (nerves， central nervous system) \\[24\\]. Through this the-ory， AJM which is rotational joint mobilization with joint shift was suggested and investigated on our patient with shoulder adhesive capsulitis.

First， only one patient was included in the case report. Second， there was a small possibility that the cause-and-effect relationship between the intervention and the out-comes may not be established， as changes could have been related to the natural recovery or a placebo effect.

She presented to a primary care clinic with a 3-week history of itchy， ring-like skin lesions that started on her neck and chest but subsequently spread widely on her chest， back， and upper extremities. She was first treated as having extensive tinea corporis but responded poorly to multiple courses of antifungal treatment. An initial skin biopsy that was taken at the der-matology clinic revealed features suggestive of erythema annulare centrifugum. However， despite topical ste-roid treatment， her skin condition evolved further and she developed generalized erythroderma along with fol-licular hyperkeratosis and palmoplantar keratoderma. A repeat biopsy finally confirmed the diagnosis of PRP. Making the diagnosis of PRP is challenging for clinicians. However， clinicians should approach any common skin problem that does not respond to treatment appropriately， with consideration of other uncommon skin disor-ders. A repeat skin biopsy may be considered if there are any doubts about the diagnosis. A clinical and histo-pathological correlation is important to aid in the diagnosis of PRP.\n\n【24】Keywords： Annular Erythema · Dermatology·Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris · Tinea\n\n【25】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/936906\n\n【26】Pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) is a rare skin condition that was first described in the 1800s \\[1-3\\]. Due to the rarity of the disease， the worldwide incidence rate of PRP is not known. Approximately 1 in 5000 cases in an outpatient dermatology in the United Kingdom in 1980 was diagnosed with PRP \\[3\\]， with no recently published data. In 2020， a Facebook PRP group has approximately 1500 members worldwide \\[4\\]. There are6 clinical subtypes of PRP \\[3，5\\]； with the classical adult-type(Type l) being the commonest \\[6\\]. Other types are Type ll， the atypical adult-type； Type Ill， the classical juvenile type； TypeⅣ， the circumscribed juvenile type； Type V， the atypical juve-nile type； and Type VI， which is PRP associated with HIV/AIDS. PRP can affect any race and can occur at any age and in either sex. Although there are cases of the familial autosomal dom-inant form of PRP \\[7\\] and reports have shown an association with drugs such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors and autoimmune diseases such as myasthenia gravis， autoimmune thyroiditis， and celiac disease \\[8，9\\]， the exact etiology and pathogene-sis of PRP remain unclear. PRP has been reported in patients with concurrent medical conditions such as diabetic mellitus. allergic rhinitis， dyslipidemia， depression， arthritis， cardiovas-cular diseases， hypothyroidism， malignancies， HI， and other skin conditions \\[5，10，11\\].\n\n【27】PRP usually presents with 2 primary features - follicular hy-perkeratotic papules and palmoplantar keratoderma - but it can have a range of varying clinical presentations. The typical clinical presentation is the appearance of small follicular hyper-keratotic papules， with a yellowish ring surrounding a central， smooth keratotic plug. This appearance is termed “nutmeg grater sign\". It can also present as inflamed plaques with is-lands of sparing， pityriasiform scales， and erythroderma.Other initial clinical presentations include erythema of the extensor surfaces of knees and elbows， skin lichenification， ichthyo sis， eczema-like skin changes， hair loss， and nail thickening or discoloration \\[10\\]. The diagnosis of PRP is made by correlat-ing the clinical and histopathologic features. The rarity of PRP and its varied range of clinical presentations make the diag nosis of the condition quite challenging， especially in the pri-mary care setting， where the diagnosis is often delayed.Only approximately half of classic PRP patients were correctly di-agnosed when they presented early \\[11\\]. The most common misdiagnoses include psoriasis， contact dermatitis， and ecze-ma or spongiotic dermatitis \\[10\\]. About 2% of PRP patients were initially diagnosed as having tinea \\[10\\].\n\n【28】Case Report\n\n【29】A 61-year-old woman presented to a primary care outpatient clinic with a 3-week history of multiple small， red， itchy， ring-like\n\n【30】Figure 1. Initial presentation： Well-demarcated， erythematous， rounded， scaly， annular-like lesions mimicking tinea corporis.\n\n【31】spots that initially appeared on her face and neck. The rash then increased and spread widely throughout her whole body. She visited 2 primary care clinics and was twice treated un-successfully with short-course topical miconazole 1% cream. She had underlying allergic rhinitis， dyslipidemia， and poorly-controlled diabetes， with HbA1c 10.5%. Her medications were oral Janumet (metformin/sitagliptin)， gliclazide MR， atorvas-tatin， loratadine， and budesonide nasal spray. There was no history of taking any new medications and she did not have any drug allergies. She was a non-smoker.\n\n【32】On examination， there were raised， well-demarcated， erythem-atous， rounded， annular-like lesions on her face， neck， chest， abdomen， back， and upper extremities. Some of the lesions had reddish-orange periphery scales (Figure 1). Results of oth-er system examinations were unremarkable. The diagnosis of extensive tinea corporis was made based on physical exam-ination findings and her underlying poorly-controlled diabe tes. She was given oral fluconazole 200 mg weekly and was referred to an outpatient dermatology clinic.\n\n【33】She was seen at the dermatology clinic 1 month later. Her skin condition had not improved， despite the course of oral flucon-azole. A skin biopsy was taken， and investigations including a complete blood count， renal profile， liver function test， ANA， C3， C4， and viral screening. A skin scraping for fungal culture and sensitivity was also taken and it was negative. Autoimmune and viral screening results were negative， and all other blood investigation results were within normal ranges.\n\n【34】The first skin biopsy result suggested a possible diagnosis of erythema annulare centrifugum (EAC) (Figure 2). She was sub-sequently prescribed betamethasone valerate 0.1% topical cream twice daily over her body and clobetasone 0.05% topical\n\n【35】Figure 2. First biopsy. Section of the skin shows an epidermal layer with focal parakeratosis (black arrow)， mild spongiosis， and perivascular lymphoid aggregate (red arrow)， which are features suggestive of EAC.\n\n【36】cream twice daily over her face for a month. She was also giv-en aqueous cream emollient and oral cetirizine 10 mg daily.\n\n【37】However， the rash did not respond to the treatment. She visited a private primary care clinic due to worsening skin lesions and severe pruritus. She was given a course of oral clarithromycin500 mg twice daily. She then developed widespread erythro-derma 3 days after taking the antibiotics and was promptly admitted to the hospital due to a suspicion of severe antibi-otic allergy. In the ward， her skin condition evolved to gener-alized erythroderma with islands of sparing (Figure 3). There\n\n【38】Figure 3. Erythroderma with islands of sparing (red arrow) on the lower limbs.\n\n【39】was waxy keratoderma on the palms and soles， which start-ed to desquamate after a few days of treatment (Figure 4). There were also orange-red plaques with follicular prominenc-es， but they were poorly appreciated after initiating treatment. The new evolving presentation of skin features suggested the\n\n【40】Figure 5. Second biopsy： Acanthosis， spongiosis， focal prominent granular layer， thick suprapapillary plate.

A sec-ond skin biopsy was performed. The correlation of clinical and histological findings (Figure 5) confirmed the diagnosis of pit-yriasis rubra pilaris. She was initially treated with methotrex-ate but there was minimal response. She was then switched to oral acitretin 25 mg daily and the rash began to resolve.\n\n【42】The diagnosis of PRP was made 4 months after the initial presentation. Three months after the diagnosis of PRP and\n\n【43】appropriate treatment， her skin condition improved. After 6months of acitretin therapy， her PRP was in remission (Figure 6).\n\n【44】Discussion\n\n【45】The patient presented to a primary care clinic at an early stage of PRP with lesions that were similar to tinea corporis. Tinea corporis is a skin fungal infection that is common in tropical regions where the weather is warm and humid \\[12\\]， such as Malaysia. In addition， the patient also has poorly-controlled diabetes， a known predisposing factor for tinea infection. The diagnosis of tinea corporis can be made with microscopic ex-amination of skin scrapings stained with potassium hydro-chloride (KOH). However， tinea corporis is usually diagnosed clinically， with the findings of typical pruritic， well-demarcat-ed， erythematous， annular， raised scaling patches with cen-tral clearing \\[13\\].\n\n【46】There are no known serologic or immunohistochemical mark-ers to aid or confirm the diagnosis of PRP \\[6\\]. Although addi-tional tests are often done to rule out other possible differen-tial diagnoses， the results are often normal. The diagnosis of PRP is made by correlating the clinical findings and the histo-pathological features. However， in the present patient， the di-agnosis was challenging in the beginning as the clinical find-ings mimicked tinea corporis， and the initial histologic findings did not demonstrate a clear diagnostic picture of PRP.\n\n【47】Almost 54% of PRP patients had 2 or more biopsies before the diagnosis was established \\[10\\]. Our patient underwent 2separate skin biopsies before the diagnosis of PRP was con-firmed. The first biopsy had similar morphology as the super-ficial variant of EAC (Figure 2). EAC is typically characterized histologically by perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate of lympho-cytes with a “coat sleeve\" appearance. The superficial type is characterized by epidermal changes like focal spongiosis，\n\n【48】Figure 6. Treatment response. Skin condition after 2 weeks of acitretin therapy (A)， and when the patient was entering remission (B).\n\n【49】focal parakeratosis， epidermal hyperplasia， and papillary der-mal edema \\[14\\]. The second biopsy was taken when the pa-tient had started to develop erythroderma and palmoplan-tar keratoderma， manifesting the features of classical adult PRP. The morphology was well-developed and more specific. Considering the patient’s evolving clinical features and corre-lating with these biopsy findings， the diagnosis of PRP could then be confirmed.\n\n【50】The treatment of PRP consists of topical and systemic ther-apies. In mild-to-moderate disease， especially for localized types of PRP， topical treatment with corticosteroids， calcipot-riol，tazarotene， and emollients may be adequate. Moderate-to-severe diseases are treated with systemic therapy in addi-tion to topical treatment \\[11\\]. The first-line therapy is retinoids such as isotretinoin and acitretin. Other systemic therapies in-clude methotrexate， cyclosporine， and combinations of acitre-tin with narrowband-UVB， UVA1， or PUVA \\[11\\]. Our patient was initially treated with methotrexate due to the availability and cost. However， she did not respond well to the treatment. Her treatment was successful after switching to acitretin， and the skin lesions showed marked improvement.\n\n【51】The diagnosis of PRP is often delayed and can seriously affect a patient's life \\[15\\]. The skin lesions may worsen and evolve despite being treated by multiple doctors. The itchiness and burning sensation on the skin can affect activities of daily living. Therefore， a prompt diagnosis with appropriate management is important to improve the patients' overall quality of life \\[15\\].\n\n【52】References：\n\n【53】1\\. Brown F， Badri T.

Aortic root diameter is influenced by some factors， and its dilation can cause many symptoms in patients. The purpose of the present case report was to describe the outcomes of the holistic treatment approach， which is called the Remember Regeneration Therapy Method (RTM) protocol， with emphasis on phytotherapy and complementary alternative medicine (CAM) for a patient with aortic dilation. Case Presentation： A53-year-old male patient attended the special CAM therapy clinic due to headache， anxiety， tachycardia and stress. As the echocardiographic evaluation of the aorta is a routine part of the standard echocardiographic examination is well-known， his echocardiography was compatible with the aorta's dilatation. Following the RTM protocol， the patient exhibited an improvement in his clinical outcome capacity (the diameter of the aorta's root： from 43 mm to 30 mm， a decrease of symptoms such as headache， anxiety， tachycardia， and stress) after 27-months of progress. Conclusion： We conclude that based on the fast cardiological impairment， the RTM protocol was indicated， which achieved favorable outcomes after this patient's follow-up.\n\n【5】KEYWORDS Aortic root dilatation， RTM method，holistic medicine\n\n【6】Background\n\n【7】Aortic root dilation is a big jeopardy circumstance for aneurysm， dissection， and sudden cardiac death \\[1\\]. Aortic root diameter is prejudiced by determinants such as gender， age， body size， and blood pressure \\[2\\]. It is well-known that arterial wall rigidity rises with age， related to variations in aortic geometry \\[3\\]. Addi-tionally， the engagement of various molecular ways in cardiac aging is rising， even if their character is well-discovered and agreed upon \\[4\\]. Furthermore， immune-mediated inflamma-tory reaction with macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration is included in the mechanism of aorta dilatation \\[4，5\\]. Concerning the vascular system， the aorta， as the complete cardiovascular system or organ， tissue， and human body system， presents vari-ous age adjustments \\[6\\].

Visions and developments in the progress of cardiovascular diseases are stimulated. These advances might allow for recognizing pathways intimately involved in cardio-vascular pathophysiology and helpful in improving adminis-tration， outcomes， and human disease prevention. Now， it is possible to identify distinct levels of aging in the cardiovascular system \\[4\\].\n\n【16】Today， scientific researchers have shown that new generation complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) strategies for the treatment of specific disease conditions will increase bene-fits with improvements in research technologies \\[71. There is a notable interest in CAM applications in the world. According to The WHO Traditional Medicine (TM) Strategy 2014-2023，WHO has stated that in developing countries， several CAM applica-tions have been in the primary health care service， and that will contribute to the improvement of health outcomes \\[8\\].\n\n【17】The Remember Regeneration Therapy Method (RTM) is a holistic approach that is a special management procedure where phytotherapy is at its center and integrated with CAM appli-cations. In the RTM， the organization policy is recognized for recovering health by basically positive the deteriorating func-tions \\[91.\n\n【18】However， no published reports have described the holistic protocol with emphasis on phytotherapy and CAM applications for patients with dilatation of the aorta. Therefore， the purpose\n\n【19】of this study is to describe the outcomes of phytotherapy in a patient with symptoms of dilatation of the aorta.\n\n【20】Case presentation\n\n【21】A 53-year-old male from Izmir， Turkey， had been suffering from dilatation of the aorta. The patient had a family history of heart disease and was considered at a higher risk of heart disease. His main symptoms were headache，anxiety， tachycardia， stress and breathing disorder during sleep. He was diagnosed as hav-ing dilatation of the aorta. He also had hypertension， and he had been taking anti-hypertension (Enalapril maleate + Lercani-dipine hydrochloride -Zanipress 10 mg/10 mg 1x1) medical drugs. Over the past year， his cardiological and psychological symptoms had increased. In October 2016， in his cardiological evaluation， severe left ventricular hypertrophy dilated the aortic root (the diameter of the root of the aorta： 43 mm) and ascend-ing aorta， mild mitral & aortic valve failure， dilated left atrium were detected with transthoracic echocardiography examination(TTE).\n\n【22】The patient accepted to be involved in the RTM model， which consists of special phytotherapeutics and various holistic treat-ment methods in RTM Clinic， Izmir， Turkey. The patient was healed in 27-months of progress (between November 2016 and January 2019) following the treatment. This patient was also shown to be cured with RTM treatment after a 19 months follow-up period confirming the efficacy of the procedure. The follow-ing RTM protocol was applied for the patient.\n\n【23】RTM Protocol：\n\n【24】1\\. RTM Phytotherapeutics\n\n【25】a.DVD.Reg (A mixture with thistle)\n\n【26】b. ALC.HDB (A mixture with hawthorn)\n\n【27】c. ARD.Rem (A mixture with juniper fruit)\n\n【28】d. SDS.X (St. John's wort extract)\n\n【29】e. DTX.19 (A mixture with thymus vulgaris)\n\n【30】2\\. Additional Methods： Cupping therapy， ozone therapy (Ma-jor and minor autohemotherapy)， acupuncture (40 sessions for each one)\n\n【31】In January 2019， in his cardiological evaluation， the diame-ter of the aortic root， 30 mm， normal mitral and aortic valve， was detected with TTE. No failure of mitral & aortic was also observed.\n\n【32】After 27 months， his symptoms such as headache，tachycar-dia， anxiety， stress， and breathing disorder during sleep returned to normal status or disappeared. He expressed that he felt much better than before.\n\n【33】Follow up period\n\n【34】The patient was requested for control once per 3 months， and physical examination and other practices were performed. Clini-cal complaints were not observed after 19 months of follow-up of the patient with dilatation of the aorta. Furthermore， RTM therapy breaks because of adverse effects were not identified. The treatment presented a proper safety formation and was correlated with a excellent response rate of 100% at months 27.\n\n【35】The current suggestion is the tough character of a chronic im-mune/inflammatory development in aneurysm evocation and advancement \\[4\\]. In this condition， medical therapy's leading goal is to decrease shear pressure on the diseased segment of the aorta by reducing blood pressure and cardiac contractility \\[2\\].\n\n【36】Dilatation of the aortic root with and without aortic insuf-ficiency is usually produced by anomalies of the aortic wall's connective tissue. The aortic root describes the flow tract from the left ventricle， where its performance is a link between the left ventricle and the ascending aorta \\[10\\].\n\n【37】Accessible information recommends that the upper limit of\n\n【38】PEL\n\n【39】healthy individuals'aortic dimensions does not surpass 40 mm. Various determinants seem to influence aortic root dimensions in healthy， non-athletic individuals. Naturally，enlargement of the aortic root may be anticipated to happen in reply to the recur-rent hemodynamic overload related to the athletic happenings\\[11\\]. The typical current suggestions for aortic root surgery are aneurysmal dilatation with or without aortic valve disease， acute aortic dissection \\[10\\].\n\n【40】In the present case report， the RTM therapy protocol with emphasis on phytotherapy and CAM applications achieved sat-isfactory results in a patient with dilatation of aortic root. In-terestingly， almost the complete reduction in symptoms was achieved. The treatment strategy was to improve dilatation of aortic root and reduce cardiological symptoms such as headache， anxiety， etc.\n\n【41】However， no studies have been utilizing combined therapy protocol such as phytotherapy and CAM applications in patients with dilatation of aortic root. Further studies are needed to clar-ify the effects of phytotherapy and CAM applications comparing with surgery in patients with dilatation of aortic root.\n\n【42】In some clinical disorders， Traditional Chinese Medicine is regularly used for many years， several forms of herbal products\\[12\\]. One of them， Ginsenoside Rb1， is one of the most significant members among the identified ginsenosides and has been de-scribed to decrease ischemia damage in multiple organs \\[13-15\\]. Similarly， it indicates the protecting outcome of ginsenoside Rb1on cardiac dysfunction and remodelling in rats' heart failure.\\[16\\]. In another study， Ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1)， one of Panax ginseng's ingredients， has been informed about inhibiting left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy in rats. Rg1-induced stability ver-sus LV hypertrophy provoked by abdominal aorta coarctation in rats is facilitated by endogenous nitric oxide production \\[17\\].\n\n【43】In the process of investigating how disorders occur， a deter-mined common of epigenetic modifications caused by etiological origins is probably adjustable. Therefore， clinically identified patients can be improved by regulating epigenetic adjustments and anomalies while suitable treatment protocols are used to pa-tients， a new approach， such as the RTM model. Consequently， the RTM model has utilized a unique therapy procedure by creating proper regenerative combinations and remembering phytotherapeutic agents and CAM applications \\[9\\].\n\n【44】A holistic approach to observe this case is critical for dilata-tion of the aortic root's optimal administration， considering the RTM protocol by which the dilatation of aortic root patient has been very well tolerated， and no side effects have been observed. Further functional， much more comprehensive researches are needed to identify epigenetically regulated genes and to prove effectiveness in this framework.\n\n【45】A special holistic approach with RTM protocol yielded the per-fect improvement of dilatation of aortic root and provided better-quality cardiac function and symptoms in patients in a short time without side effects. This appropriate effect of the RTM protocol could be related to its epigenetic changes and adjustments. The RTM protocol may offer a potentially effective and relatively safe approach to retard the progression of cardiac problems and their symptoms， particularly in dilatation of aortic root patients， as an alternative therapy modality.\n\n【46】Disclosures\n\n【47】The authors have no funding or conflicts of interest to disclose.\n\n【48】References\n\n【49】1\\.

These can occur as a consequence of healing following surgery or trauma. However， an enti-ty known as congenital band exists where a band is present from birth. Here we report three such cases of adults with symptoms of intestinal obstruction， in whom a congenital band was discovered through explor-atory laparoscopy\n\n【20】Case Reports： All three of these patients presented lacking a history of any abdominal trauma or previous abdominal surger-ies， a fact that is often used to exclude an adhesion as a differential. All three recovered quickly and had relief of their symptoms following surgical intervention.\n\n【21】Conclusions：\n\n【22】Bands and adhesions are common surgical causes of small bowel obstruction， leading to symptoms such as nausea， vomiting， constipation， and obstipation. These bands almost always result from a prior abdominal sur-gery or from a recent abdominal trauma. The three cases presented here show a far more unusual picture of a band， one that is congenitally present， as there was an absence of such a history. This is significant because clinical suspicion of a band is often very low due to a lack of distinguishing clinical and diagnostic features， and when the past history is negative.\n\n【23】MeSH Keywords： General Surgery· Hand-Assisted Laparoscopy·Laparotomy\n\n【24】Full-text PDF http：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/899664\n\n【25】口22276 盟3 山司9 14 225\n\n【26】Constipation is one of the most common complaints faced by physicians and emergency departments. It accounts for nearly5% of hospital visits and consists of a very broad set of differ-ential diagnoses， including but not limited to bowel obstruction， neurogenic conditions， and congenital bands \\[1\\]. Although con-genital bands that lead to intestinal obstruction are extremely rare， if not identified early enough， they can lead to dangerous and often life-threatening situations. Congenital bands arise from abnormal adhesions of peritoneal folds that form during the process of embryogenesis \\[2\\]. These bands can be found anywhere along the Gl tract (e.g.，ascending colon， ileum， liga-ment of Treitz， etc.). For this reason， surgical exploration in the context of a vague presentation of bowel obstruction should always be considered \\[2\\]. Furthermore， it is important to keep in mind that small bowel obstruction due to a band cannot be ruled out， even in the absence of history of abdominal trauma or prior surgical procedure. In this case report， three different presentations of congenital bands are discussed.\n\n【27】Case Report\n\n【28】Case 1 (Videos 1-3)\n\n【29】A 33-year-old male， previously healthy， presented for diffuse abdominal pain. His pain was mainly epigastric， non-radiating， and not relieved by changes in his position or by analgesics. He denied vomiting， diarrhea， fever， and chills. Additionally， he denied any history of abdominal trauma as well as any prior abdominal surgeries.\n\n【30】His past medical history as well as family history were un remarkable. He had no known drug or food allergies， denied smoking， and occasionally drank alcohol. Prior to admission， this patient had been admitted twice to other hospitals. During both of these admissions he was diagnosed with small bow-el obstruction for which he was treated by nasogastric tube decompression and kept non per os. He was then discharged home after his pain was relieved and flatus was passed.\n\n【31】Upon physical exam， the patient appeared pale， with a dis-tended， soft abdomen， and positive bowel sounds.

Occasional tobacco and alcohol consumption was noted. The patient denied a previous history of direct abdominal trauma or abdominal surgeries.\n\n【66】Physical exam revealed a soft distended abdomen with hyper-active bowel sounds. The abdomen was tympanic to percus-sion with diffuse tenderness to palpation.\n\n【67】Vital signs upon admission were as follows： blood pressure (BP)110/70， pulse (P) 64， and temperature (T) 36C. Labs upon ad-mission were unremarkable (Table 3).\n\n【68】A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous con-trast was done and showed small bowel dilatation of the mid-dle third and distal third of the jejunum. There was also， to a lesser degree， an ileal dilation that did not extend to the ter-minal ileum (Figures 6， 7). Additionally， a moderate effusion was noted in the cul-de-sac.\n\n【69】The patient was kept non per os and was started on antibiot-ics. A nasogastric tube was inserted， and fluid input and out-put were monitored accurately.\n\n【70】During the following day， the patient remained obstipated with diffuse abdominal pain noted upon palpation. The nasogas-tric tube gave 500 cc of fluid. The decision was made to pro-ceed with an exploratory laparotomy.\n\n【71】The procedure was begun with a midline infraumbilical lapa-rotomy incision. Dilated small bowel loops were identified from\n\n【72】Figure 6. Transverse cut abdominal pelvic CT of case 3 showing transition zone in the small bowel.\n\n【73】Figure 7. Sagittal cut abdominal pelvic CT of case 3 showing a transition zone in the small bowel.\n\n【74】the mid jejunum until the terminal ileum. Two mesenteric bands were identified. One band was identified in the mid jejunum and the other in the terminal ileum (Figures 8，9). Enterolysis was performed to liberate the bowel loops. Afterwards the bowels were cleared via retrograde emptying by milking and gastric aspiration. The abdomen was then washed well and closed.\n\n【75】The patient improved significantly. Flatus was passed at day two post-laparotomy， following which the nasogastric tube was removed and per os diet was initiated. The patient was dis-charged home on a soft diet and with stable vitals.\n\n【76】Figure 8. Case 3 band causing obstruction of the small bowel at the level of the jejunum.\n\n【77】Figure 9. Case 3 band causing small bowel obstruction at the level of the terminal ileum.\n\n【78】The pathology revealed a fibro-inflammatory band with no signs of malignancy.\n\n【79】Discussion\n\n【80】Adhesive bands in patients lacking a history of direct abdom-inal trauma or inflammatory condition are a very rare occur-rence. Furthermore， small bowel obstruction due to such con-genital bands is exceedingly infrequent， with an exact incidence that remains unclear \\[1\\]. These congenital bands are an in-frequent cause of obstruction in childhood and are extremely rare in adults \\[2，3\\]. Our three reported cases ranged from the ages of 19 to 33 years old， well outside the typical age range of presentation. Because of this， as well as the rarity of this\n\n【81】pathology， physicians often maintain a very low index of sus-picion of obstruction due to a band in adult patients.\n\n【82】Occlusion due to these bands results either from compression of the small bowel or from trapping of the intestines between the band and the mesentery. However， symptoms are usually those found in any kind of intestinal obstruction， a fact that makes preoperative diagnosis difficult. Similarly， findings on KUB are nonspecific. Ultrasound and CT scan may give details such as localized distended loops or signs of peritonitis， while a barium-contrast gastrointestinal series may provide addi-tional clues to the diagnosis \\[4\\]. In our cases， imaging yielded findings such as the “whirlpool\" sign， which is often seen in patients with a volvulus or internal hernia. This further illus-trates the need to maintain congenital band as a differential in small bowel obstruction， even when the imaging can point to a different diagnosis.\n\n【83】Despite looking different from postoperative adhesions intra-operatively， there is no difference in the clinical picture and initial workup. The difference lies in the absence of a histo-ry of abdominal surgery or trauma， something that is often used to rule out a band as the cause of obstruction， leading to a missed diagnosis or delayed intervention. Thus， it is im-portant to maintain a high index of suspicion in patients of any age presenting with signs and symptoms of small bow-el obstruction and to keep obstruction due to a band as a dif-ferential diagnosis， because the only way to distinguish the diagnosis is through surgical exploration.\n\n【84】Different sites of obstruction have been reported in the liter-ature. Akgur et al. reported eight cases of bands located most commonly between the right colon and ileum as well as be-tween the Treitz angle and the terminal ileum， between the right lobe of the liver and the terminal ileum， and between the right lobe of the liver and the right colon \\[3\\]. Lin et al. reported a case of a band migrating from the iliac fossa to the sigmoid colon \\[5\\]， while Itagaki et al. reported a jejuno-jejuno band \\[6\\]. The band was well vascularized in all of these cases \\[4\\]. In ref-erence to the cases presented in this report， we note sever-al locations of the identified congenital bands. In case 1， two bands were identified， one at the high jejunum and the other at the Treitz angle. In case 2， one band was identified at the level of the jejunum， while in case 3， two mesenteric bands were identified at the level of the jejunum and terminal ileum.\n\n【85】Two of the patients were previously healthy with no reported home medications. In case 2， the patient had a known history of acute myeloblastic leukemia and was taking the four medica-tions listed above in the case (Valtrex， Bactrim， Normix， Ospen). However， there is nothing reported in the literature that correlates acute myeloblastic leukemia or the above medications with for-mation of bands in the abdomen or any other type of adhesion.\n\n【86】Out of 32 cases of congenital bands reported in the litera-ture \\[6-11\\]， 2 deaths were reported， correlating with a 94%survival rate \\[2，3\\]. Overall prognosis is very good， although a good index of suspicion needs to be maintained to ensure that the diagnosis of congenital band is not dismissed.\n\n【87】More recently the method of laparoscopic exploration has grad-ually become accepted as a feasible and low-risk option for the diagnosis of the cause of small bowel obstruction \\[12-24\\]. This method provides the added benefit of allowing for simul-taneous intervention and relief of the obstruction. Additionally. this step is required for the final diagnosis and treatment of a congenital band. Thus， in addition to a high index of suspi-cion， a low threshold for the use of surgical exploration should be maintained. The success rate for adhesiolysis using lapa-roscopy in small bowel obstruction ranges from 48% to 82%. Conversion to laparotomy is usually due to the presence of bowel gangrene， massive adhesion， failure to identify the eti-ology or location of the occlusion， and bowel perforation dur-ing the procedure \\[15-20\\]. Exclusion criteria for the laparo-scopic approach include patients with poor general condition， sepsis， peritonitis， extremely dilated bowel loops， and previ-ous laparotomies \\[12\\]. In our cases， two patients were treat-ed with a laparoscopic approach， while the third was treat-ed by laparotomy due to an increased risk of bowel ischemia.\n\n【88】Laparoscopic treatment in small bowel obstruction is advanta-geous because it is associated with a shorter operative time， fewer postoperative adhesions， a lower rate of wound infec-tion， quicker recovery， a shorter stay in hospital， and less pain. Conversion to laparotomy is not a failure， but rather， an oblig-atory step in management \\[25\\].\n\n【89】Conclusions\n\n【90】Small bowel obstruction due to bands is a very rare occurrence， especially in patients lacking a history of abdominal surgery or trauma. Here we report three such cases of small bowel obstruc-tion caused by congenital bands in three separate adults， which were identified following laparoscopic exploration. Treatment was initiated by laparoscopic excision of the bands， which led to immediate resolution of symptoms. These three patients fall well outside the age norm for presentation of obstruction due to a congenital band， so the differential should be maintained even in adult patients. Diagnosis of this pathology is often dif-ficult because of the lack of history of trauma or prior abdomi-nal surgery， as well as the lack of distinguishing findings on his-tory， physical exam， and imaging. Therefore， in order to make the proper diagnosis， congenital band should always be kept as a differential diagnosis regardless of the age of the patient， and a high index of suspicion should be maintained with a low threshold for exploratory laparoscopy or laparotomy.\n\n【91】References：\n\n【92】1\\.

The most common obstructed part is the narrow terminal il-eum， whereas the jejunum is rarely affected. The gallstone is postulated to reach the small bowel by gradual erosion from the gall bladder， most commonly into the duodenum， forming a cholecysto-duodenal fistula.\n\n【16】Case Report：\n\n【17】Herein， we report a 72-year-old male who presented with intestinal obstruction of a 5-day duration， with a clin-ical diagnosis of an irreducible inguinal hernia. However， the patient continued to be symptomatic following an uncomplicated hernioplasty. A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed a small bow-el lesion， which intra-operatively was confirmed to be an impacted gallstone in the jejunum with a cholecys-to-duodenal fistula.\n\n【18】Conclusions：\n\n【19】Despite gallstone is uncommon cause of intestinal obstruction， a high index of suspicion with a careful CT scan interpretation is the key to the diagnosis， especially when there is a red-herring distracting the attention， like irreducible hernia in this case.\n\n【20】MeSH Keywords： Biliary Fistula· Gallstones · Intestinal Obstruction\n\n【21】Full-text PDF http：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/897646\n\n【22】Gallstone disease is a rare cause of mechanical intestinal ob-struction； however， it is more common in the elderly， account-ing for up to 25% of non-strangulated bowel obstructions \\[1\\]. Gallstone ileus is a rare complication of chronic calcular cho-lecystitis； the stone usually migrates through a cholecysto duodenal fistula and impacts at the terminal ileum (ileocecal valve)， which has the narrowest intestinal lumen \\[2\\]. Gallstone ileus poses a diagnostic challenge， especially within the elder-ly population， who often have many comorbidities \\[3\\]. Delay in the diagnosis of ileus increases the morbidity and mortal-ity； therefore， an early and focused approach towards an ac-curate diagnosis is warranted.\n\n【23】Treatment of gallstone ileus may include enterolithotomy， cholecystectomy and repair of the cholecysto-enteric fistu-la in one stage， or enterolithotomy alone， depending on the general condition of the patient. Herein， we report an unusu-al case of gall stone ileus with a misleading presentation and co-incident irreducible hernia.\n\n【24】Case Report\n\n【25】A 72-year-old diabetic man presented to the Emergency Department with a 5-day history of intermittent peri-umbili-cal colicky pain， associated with bilious vomiting and obstipa-tion. There was no history of similar episodes. He had no ab-dominal surgery in the past.\n\n【26】On general examination， the patient looked dehydrated. The abdomen was distended and a tender irreducible right ingui-nal hernia was noted. The significant laboratory results revealed leukocytosis (WBC 14 100/pL)， elevated blood urea nitrogen(17.9 mmol/L)，serum creatinine (153 pmol/L)， blood sugar (18.7mmol/L)， bilirubin15 (normal 1.7-17 umol/)， ALP 46 (45-115U/L)， ALT 21 (7-55 U/L)， and amylase 25 (23-85 U/L). An abdomen plain X-ray showed multiple air levels at the mid-abdomen， no radiopaque shadow， and no air under the diaphragm (Figure 1).\n\n【27】A computerized tomography (CT) scan confirmed the diagno-sis of irreducible hernia (Figure 2). Once stabilized， the patient underwent an uncomplicated right inguinal hernioplasty. Post-operatively， the patient continued to have abdominal pain and distension， and the nasogastric tube drainage revealed intesti-nal contents. A contrast-enhanced CT (oral and I contrast) of the abdomen revealed a small bowel mass with proximal dil-atation and air within the gall bladder (Figures 3， 4).\n\n【28】The patient underwent a laparotomy and a large gallstone(5x3x2.5 cm) was found impacted in the jejunum， 30 cm from the duodeno-jejunal junction (Figures 5，6). The duodenum was\n\n【29】Figure 1. Plain abdomen x-ray： Multiple air levels at the mid-abdomen (arrows)， no radiopaque shadow， and no air under the diaphragm.\n\n【30】Figure 2. A CT scan with contrast showing an irreducible hernia(arrow).\n\n【31】found to be pulled up into the gallbladder fossa with dense adhesions suggestive of a cholecysto-duodenal fistula (corrob-orating the CT scan finding of air within the gall bladder). A longitudinal enterotomy was made to extract the stone and it was closed transversely. The post-operative recovery was un-eventful. The patient was discharged home on the 7th post-operative day in a good general condition.\n\n【32】Discussion\n\n【33】Gallstone ileus accounts for 1-4% of mechanical small bow-el obstruction \\[3-6\\]. However， the incidence rate may reach25% among older patients (>65 years)， with a female pre-dominance \\[3-5\\].\n\n【34】Gallstone ileus is a rare complication of cholelithiasis， noted in only 2-3% of all cases associated with recurrent episodes of\n\n【35】Figure 3. A CT scan with contrast showing an ectopic stone at the jejunum (arrow)， and a dilated proximal small intestine.\n\n【36】Figure 4. A CT scan with contrast showing air in the gallbladder(arrow).\n\n【37】cholecystitis \\[3，6\\]. However， misdiagnosis is common in gall-stone ileus and carries a significant rate of complications with a high mortality rate (12-27%) \\[3\\].\n\n【38】The most common pathogenesis is attributed to erosion of the gallstone through the gallbladder into the duodenum， form-ing a cholecysto-duodena. fistula \\[7\\]. The gallstone may im-pact at any part of the gut， but in more than 90% of cases it lodges in the distal part of the ileum \\[8\\].\n\n【39】Figure 5. An intraoperative obstructing gallstone at the jejunum(arrow).\n\n【40】Figure 6. The extracted gallstone.\n\n【41】Symptoms of gallstone ileus may be vague， intermittent， or in-consistent \\[3-6J. Ayantunde et al. reported a prior history of gall-stone disease in only 27% of cases \\[6\\]. The accurate preopera-tive diagnosis of gallstone ileus has been reported in 43-73% of cases， with a delay of 2-4.5 days between admission and sur-gical intervention \\[6\\]. Although plain abdominal X-ray is a main tool in the assessment of small bowel obstruction， it has a sen-sitivity of only 40-70% in the diagnosis of gallstone ileus \\[3\\]. Ultrasonography may offer better results than plain X-ray， but its sensitivity is less than 75%. CT scan offers overall sensitivity， specificity， and accuracy of 93%， 100%， and 99%， respectively \\[3\\].\n\n【42】The management of gallstone ileus depends on the size of the stone and the clinical condition of the patient. The main aim of the treatment is to relieve the intestinal obstruction and to minimize the complications. Correction of fluid and electrolyte\n\n【43】imbalance should be the first step to stabilize the patient’s general condition.\n\n【44】The choice of surgical management is debatable and is largely determined by the general condition of the patient. Only en terolithotomy is considered adequate in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities \\[4，6，9\\]. However， one-stage surgery(enterolithotomy， cholecystectomy， and repair of the fistula) is only considered in young， fit， and hemodynamically stable patients \\[6，10\\]. Reisner et al. reported a 16.9% mortality rate of the single-stage procedure， compared to 11.7% for entero-lithotomy alone \\[4\\]. As spontaneous closure of the fistula is noted in about 50% of patients with enterolithotomy alone， aggressive surgery seems unnecessary \\[9，11\\].\n\n【45】In our case， the early diagnosis of gallstone ileus was masked by the coincidence of irreducible inguinal hernia (the red-her-ring)， and the misinterpretation of the CT scan findings， in ad-dition to the lack of history of gallstone disease. The surgical procedure - a simple enterolithotomy- was chosen based on the patient's clinical condition and age. Apart from the mor-bidity associated with a prolonged hospital stay， the manage-ment was justified by the uneventful recovery.\n\n【46】References：\n\n【47】1\\.

Asymptomatic for a long time and is most often discovered accidentally during a routine radiological examination or following a complication. The case we presented here is interesting of its management but also its long monitoring. A young woman 27-year-old， with no history of pathology， consulted for a painful low-left cheek swelling， asymmetry facial with a palpable tumor painless， fixed， adhering to the mandible. The endobucal examination recovered a filling of the lower vestibular cheek， without dental mobility or labio-mental hypoesthesia. The orthopantomogram and the computed-tomography showed an heterogeneous image well limited， polylobed in contact with the dental alveolar canal. A resection by endobuccal route was performed. The Diagnosis of fibrous dysplasia was confirmed by histological study. No recurrence was noted 26 months after surgery with regular clinical and radiological following since. The cranio-facial localizations are in order of frequency： occipital， parietal， zygomatic， mandibular， maxillary， ethmoidal， sphenoidal， frontal， and temporal. The diagnosis is difficult to make from clinicoradiological data， confirmed only by the anatomopathological study. Histologically， there are three types. In our case， histology had recovered the monostotic type. Evidently， sarcomatosis transformation has been well described in reason why the annual monitoring is desirable to detect earlier any recurrence or malignant transformation. The localization in the craniofacial sphere deserves special attention.

The physical examination ob-\n\n【15】Figure 2：\n\n【16】Figure 5：\n\n【17】Figure 6：\n\n【18】Figure 3：\n\n【19】Figure 4：\n\n【20】Figure 7：\n\n【21】jectified an asymmetry facial of the lower level with a palpable tumor painless， homogeneous， fixed， adhering to the left basil edge of the mandible， without local inflammatory signs or fis-tula (Figure 1). Besides， the endobucal examination recovered a 3-finger oral opening， a filling from the bottom of the lower vestibular cheek， without any dental mobility. Also， the mucosa in the front of was safe， with neither inflammatory nor fistula signs and labio-mental hypoesthesia. The orthopantomogram(Figure 2) showed a radiological clarity well limited， heteroge-neous， polylobed in contact with the dental alveolar canal and extending from the distal edge of the premolar 35 to the messial edge of the molar 37. Notably， the 37 had a radicular cyst. The computed-tomography (Figure 3) revealed a heterogeneous im-age hyperdense ， in front of the molar 37， with a thin cortical， which was broken in some places and extended to the left cheek region. This lesion had intimate contact with the alveolar dental canal of the mandible. It also noticed an apico-dental granu-loma of 35 that could probably correspond to cellulite. Whereas biology was normal. The initial indication was to perform a resection by endobuccal route. A lower left vestibular was per-formed first after incision and then peeling off under periosteum， followed by a modelling resection mandible. Finally we realized a bone regularization. The postoperative care was marked by local vestibular edema and pain managed by the usual analgesic and corticoid treatments. The Diagnosis of fibrous dysplasia was confirmed by histological study (Figures 4 and 5). No recur rence was noted 26 months after surgery with regular clinical86and radiological following since (Figures 6 and 7).\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】The cranio-facial localizations are in order of frequency： OC-cipital， parietal， zygomatic， mandibular， maxillary， ethmoidal， sphenoidal， frontal， and temporal \\[1\\]. Notwithstanding that the diagnostic orientation is based on medical imaging (tomodensit-ometry and scintigraphy)， it remains insufficient to validate and to confirm the diagnosis \\[2\\]. The diagnostic hypotheses often mentioned are osteitis， focal bone dysplasia， Florida bone dys-plasia， cementing fibroma， Paget disease or other mixed benign bone tumours \\[3\\]. Chronic or calcified osteomyelitis on cellulite， a cementome， ameloblastoma， a fibrous dysplasia， a cherubism， and a histiocytosis X were reported in our patient. The diagnosis is difficult to make from clinicopathological data \\[4\\]， confirmed only by the anatomopathological study. Histologically， there are three types of craniofacial fibrous dysplasia： condensant or com-pact， characterized by homogeneous dense bone lesions cystic linked to the poverty of the bone lines and mixed either monos-totic in 85% or polyostotic \\[1， 2\\]. It is worth mentioning that the cranial fibrous dysplasia is part of the \"fibrobone dysplasia\"group with Florida bone dysplasia \\[3\\]. In our case， histology had recovered the monostotic type with deformed， narrow bone spreads， in direct continuity with moderately cellular fibrous tissue in the absence of atypia and mitoses without osteoblastic lister (Figures 4 and5/HEx10). The treatment is surgical， and the scaling resection of fibrous tissue is indicated only if the disease is symptomatic \\[1\\]， which was the case with our patient. Sarcomatosis transformation has been well described in \\[5\\]rea-son why the annual monitoring is desirable \\[1\\] to detect earlier any recurrence or malignant transformation.\n\n【24】Conclusion\n\n【25】The localization in the craniofacial sphere deserves special at-tention because of the possible reach of the noble structures\n\n【26】that make it up. Surgical treatment is most often conservative(by modelling osteotomy) and is very satisfactory both morpho-logically and functionally. The prognosis of fibrous dysplasia lesions is generally good due to the stabilisation trend. There is a very low percentage of malignant transformation into osteosar-coma， chondrosarcoma or fibrosarcoma. The most important is the following or annual monitoring to detect any recurrence or malignant transformation.\n\n【27】Conflict of Interest\n\n【28】There are no conflicts of interest to declare by any of the authors of this report.\n\n【29】Funding\n\n【30】None\n\n【31】References\n\n【32】1\\.

It is difficult to treat， with en-bloc resection being the only curative treatment. Recurrence with distant metastases is common， but no standard treatment currently exists beyond surgery. Adjuvant therapies such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy offer little benefit. We present the case of a 63-year-old man with bilateral pulmonary metastases from parathyroid carcinoma that caused hyperparathyroidism with consequent refractory hypercalcaemia. After lung microwave ablation performed on all four pulmonary metastases， the patient remained normocalcaemic with a normal parathyroid hormone level at 13 months'follow-up.

However， this is not always possible， due to un-resectable metastatic disease or owing to patient comorbidities. Neither chemotherapy nor radiotherapy has been shown to be effective in treating parathyroid carcinoma \\[1\\]. Sorafenib is the only targeted therapy with case report demonstrating efficacy， but presently there is insufficient evidence to recommend its widespread adoption \\[1， 4\\].\n\n【18】Thermal ablation is an alternative therapeutic option that has shown success in treating pulmonary and hepatic metas-tases from parathyroid carcinoma \\[5-8\\]. The lung is the most common site for metastases in parathyroid carcinoma. There have been reports of biochemical remission following the use of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) to treat such cases \\[5-7\\]. Another heat-based thermal ablation treatment modality is microwave ab-lation (MWA)， which has a well-documented history of success in the treatment of lung cancer \\[9\\]. However， to our knowledge， there are no publications on the use of MWA in the treatment\n\n【19】Figure 1.

We de-scribe our experience in using MWA in the successful treatment of multiple pulmonary metastases in a patient with HPT-JT.\n\n【21】Case Report\n\n【22】A 63-vear-old man with a history of recurrent primary hyper-parathyroidism secondary to parathyroid carcinoma in the con-text of a genetically confirmed HPT-JT diagnosis was referred to us for ongoing surveillance and management. He initially pre-sented 24 years prior with lethargy and generalised aches and pains. Shortly after the presentation， he sustained a pathologi-cal fracture of the right forearm secondary to a brown tumour. Workup revealed hypercalcaemia， hyperparathyroidism， and extensive bone disease on radiographs. His history is notable for an aneurysmal bone cyst of the left patella， renal cysts， a previously excised left acoustic neuroma， and a calcific fibroma of the mandible. There is also a family history of hyperparathy-roidism and brown tumours. The first neck exploration was performed in 1999 with right upper parathyroidectomy and right hemithyroidectomy for presumed locally invasive parathy-roid carcinoma， resulting in resolution of hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism.\n\n【23】Following initial surgery， routine biochemical surveillance detected three recurrences of hypercalcaemia and hyperparathy-roidism： in 2011， 2014 and 2018. In the first two recurrences， neck exploration was performed， both of which eventuated in the re-section of recurrent parathyroid carcinoma involving the thyroid cartilage with a return to normocalcaemia postoperatively. In the third recurrence， however， an FDG-PET scan revealed in-tense FDG avidity in a nodule within the lower pole of the left hemithyroid and multiple mildly FDG avid bilateral pulmonary foci. No parathyroid tumour was present. A contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest revealed four well-defined pulmonary nod-\n\n【24】2.90\n\n【25】1\n\n【26】2.80\n\n【27】2.70 具2之 3\n\n【28】2.60\n\n【29】2.50\n\n【30】2.40\n\n【31】2.30\n\n【32】2.20\n\n【33】2.10\n\n【34】2.00\n\n【35】B\n\n【36】30.0口\n\n【37】25.0\n\n【38】20.0\n\n【39】15.D\n\n【40】10.0\n\n【41】5.0\n\n【42】0.0\n\n【43】\\-5.0\n\n【44】二一只一弓二\n\n【45】Figure 2.

Histopathological diagnosis was ob-tained through a CT guided biopsy (Fig. 1D) performed on the larger left lower lobe nodule， confirming metastatic parathyroid carcinoma. Various treatment options were explored and dis-cussed in a multidisciplinary team meeting， including surgery， chemotherapy， stereotactic body radiation therapy and thermal ablation. Due to the number of lesions， the bilaterality with spread across three lung lobes， the lack of evidence of efficacy with chemotherapy the poor radiosensitivity of parathyroid car-cinoma， and the likelihood of future recurrence of pulmonary metastases favouring a lung-sparing therapeutic approach， ther-mal ablation was considered the best treatment option.\n\n【47】Pre-ablation， the corrected serum calcium was 2.81 mmol/L(normal， 2.10-2.60mmol/L) and the parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was 17 pmol/L (normal， 1.0-7.0 pmol/L) (Fig. 2A， B). Mi-crowave ablations were performed in two sessions， one side each， to minimise potential morbidity. Following written in-formed consent， microwave ablation was performed using a Solero Microwave Tissue Ablation System (AngioDynamics， Latham， NY， USA). The first session was performed under gen-eral anaesthesia. Under intermittent CT fluoroscopic guidance， a dielectric antenna was percutaneously positioned through the centre of each left lower lobe metastasis with a 2.5-minute and a2-minute ablation at 80 Watts performed (Fig.3A， B). In the sec-ond MWA session executed a fortnight later， the right upper lobe and right lower lobe lesions were targeted similarly， with a 2.5-and 3-minute ablation at 80 Watts respectively (Fig.3C，D). How-ever， this time the procedures were performed under conscious sedation， which allowed for a significantly quicker session with the patient independently repositioning from prone to supine position on the CT table. Self-limiting complications observed\n\n【48】Figure 3. (A) CT guided insertion of a dielectric antenna through the upper of the left lower lobe metastasis with MWA performed for 2 minutes at 80 Watts.

(C) Ablation of the right lower lobe metastasis for 3 minutes at 80 Watts.(D) Ablation of the right upper lobe anterior metastasis for 2.5minutes at 80 Watts.\n\n【49】following the procedures included a small pneumothorax and bilateral pleural effusions.\n\n【50】A day following the second ablation session， there was a sub-stantial reduction in corrected calcium and PTH levels to 2.22mmol/L and 1.4 pmol/L， respectively. These results were sus-tained 13 months later with a corrected calcium of 2.33 mmol/L and a PTH level of 2.9 pmol/L (Fig. 2A， B). Furthermore， no recurrence of pulmonary metastases was seen on a CT chest performed at 13 months from the initial ablation (Fig. 4A-C).\n\n【51】Discussion\n\n【52】Parathyroid carcinoma is a rare endocrine malignancy compris-ing less than 1% of primary hyperparathyroidism cases. Most cases arise sporadically but can be associated with genetic syn-dromes， including HPT-JT and very infrequently， multiple en-docrine neoplasias (MEN) \\[1\\]. The disease has an indolent but progressive course， with 5-year survival rates ranging between78-91% and 10-year survival rates between 60-72%\\[1\\]. Morbidity and mortality are primarily secondary to the effects of intractable hypercalcaemia rather than due to tumour burden or mass effect\\[1J. The only definitive treatment to date is surgery via en-bloc resection of the parathyroid tumour with the ipsilateral thyroid lobe and involved adjacent structures with macroscopically clear margins \\[1\\]. However， as the disease has a recurrence rate of up to 50%， repeated surgical intervention is often required，but this is not always possible in patients with inoperable metastatic disease \\[1\\]. Even when the goal is palliation through control of hypercalcaemia， therapies are limited. Whilst there are no large-scale clinical trials， case series employing chemotherapy and radiotherapy have not been shown to improve survival and confer little benefit in hypercalcaemic control \\[1\\]. As such，newer treatment modalities are required.\n\n【53】Thermal ablation， such as RFA， is an increasingly promising palliative therapeutic option. Despite the paucity of literature specifically regarding the use of thermal ablation in the treat-\n\n【54】Figure 4. Axial CT chest acquired 13 months post-ablation.

Iguchi et al. were the first to report the use of RFA to treat hypercalcaemia from parathyroid carcinoma metastases\\[5\\]. Following RFA of three functioning pulmonary metastases， serum calcium， and PTH levels almost normalised along with a marked reduction in the size of metastases on a follow-up CT chest at 56 months \\[5\\]. Similar outcomes were achieved by Tochio et al. and DasGupta et al. \\[6， 7\\]. Notably， Tochio et al. highlighted the efficacy， safety and repeatability of RFA in treat-ing 50 metastases in 20 RFA sessions \\[6\\]. The ablative modality has also been combined with transcatheter arterial embolisation in treating unresectable hepatic metastases， achieving normocal-caemia and normal PTH levels several months later at follow-up\\[8\\]. Here， we report the first instance of the use of MWA in the treatment of pulmonary metastases from parathyroid carcinoma in a patient with HPT-JT. We demonstrate that MWA is an ef-fective， safe， and potentially repeatable alternative treatment modality in managing hypercalcaemia induced by pulmonary metastases， with normocalcaemia and normal PTH levels being achieved and maintained at 13 months post-ablation.\n\n【56】Conclusion\n\n【57】Limited therapeutic options exist for metastatic parathyroid car-cinoma， with traditional adjuvant therapies such as chemother-apy and radiotherapy being largely ineffective. This case adds to the growing body of evidence that MWA， a more recent heat-based thermal ablation modality， should be explored as a ther-apeutic option in treating patients with parathyroid carcinoma metastatic to solid organs.\n\n【58】Abbreviations\n\n【59】HPT-JT (hyperparathyroidism jaw tumour syndrome)， RFA(radiofrequency ablation)， MWA (microwave ablation)， PTH(parathyroid hormone)， MEN (multiple endocrine neoplasias)\n\n【60】Informed Consent\n\n【61】Consent was obtained from the patient for publishing this case report.\n\n【62】Funding\n\n【63】Authors did not receive any financial support in the process of research and publication of this study\n\n【64】Conflict of interest\n\n【65】The authors declared that this project was done independently without any conflict of interest.\n\n【66】References\n\n【67】1\\.

In the USA， the highest rates of infection are from the southeastern states， pre-dominantly among immigrants. There is paucity of case reports on S. stercoratis infection among HIV-infected patients who were born and raised in the USA.\n\n【32】Case Report：\n\n【33】A 61-year-old male with known HIV infection (CD4 count： 235 cells/uL， undetectable HIV RNA， on antiretroviral therapy) presented with a 3-month history of diarrhea. He was initially diagnosed to have diarrhea secondary to norovirus and later with Escherichia coli. He was treated with levofloxacin but the diarrhea persisted. Stool PCR， Clostridium difficite enzyme-linked immunoassay cryptosporidium and giardia antigen， cyclospora and isospora smear， and fecal microscopy were all negative. Peripheral blood eosinophil count was 1，000 eosino-phils/mcL. Colonic biopsies revealed fragments of S.stercoralis larvae within the crypts. The patient was treat-ed with ivermectin with improvement of symptoms. Social history revealed that he was born and raised in the northeastern USA. He was a daily methamphetamine user and engaged in anal sex with men. He denied trav-el to endemic areas， except for a visit to Japan more than 30 years ago.\n\n【34】Conclusions：\n\n【35】Our case highlights that S. stercoralis may be an underdiagnosed/under-reported cause of chronic diarrhea among HIV-infected patients. What makes this case peculiar is that the patient was born and raised in the con-tinental USA， absence of recent travel to endemic areas， and relatively high CD4 counts. Parasitic infections， such as S. stercoratis， should be considered among HIV-infected patients with persistent diarrhea and eosino-philia regardless of ethnicity or recent travel history.\n\n【36】MeSH Keywords： HIV Infections · Strongyloides stercoralis ·United States\n\n【37】Full-text PDF http：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/902626\n\n【38】H品11\n\n【39】Strongyloides stercoralis is a parasitic infection that is endemic in subtropical and tropical regions but is reported rather spo-radically in temperate countries \\[1\\]. In the USA， the highest rates of infection are from the southeastern states， predomi-nantly among immigrants. Interestingly， there is a paucity of case reports on S.stercoralis infection among HIV-infected pa-tients who were born and raised in the USA.\n\n【40】We present a rare case S.stercoralis associated diarrhea in a patient with HIV who was on antiretroviral therapy and who had relatively high CD4 counts. The patient had a negative fecal examination and was diagnosed through a colonosco-py biopsy. We searched the literature and cite cases of S.ster-coralis infection among HIV-infected patients residing in the USA and discuss latest treatments and diagnostic modalities.\n\n【41】Case Report\n\n【42】A 61-year-old male with HIV infection (CD4 count of 235 cells/pL and undetectable HlV viral load) on antiretroviral therapy with emtricitabine-tenofovir， atazanavir， raltegravir， and ritona-vir； presented to the emergency department (ED) of our hos-pital with a three-month history of diarrhea.\n\n【43】The patient had been told that he had a norovirus infection three months before presentation to our hospital， during which he developed diarrhea with mucous consistency and trace blood. The diarrhea improved but did not completely abate. When its severity increased， the patient directed himself to a different institution， where he was admitted for five days with the diagnosis of Escherichia coli gastroenteritis. He was discharged on a twelve-day course of oral levofloxacin. After six days on outpatient antibiotic therapy， the patient present-ed to our ED due to persistence of diarrhea. He complained of numerous non-bloody liquid bowel movements accompa-nied by nausea and epigastric pain. He had lost five pounds of weight over the last three months. He denied fever， vomiting， respiratory distress，wheezing， night sweats， or diaphoresis.\n\n【44】Further history revealed that he was born and raised in Connecticut. He moved to Philadelphia to complete his uni-versity degree and eventually established himself in New York where he used to work for the fashion industry. He was diag-nosed with HIV in 1985， which he attributed to unprotected sex with men. He denied history of AIDS-defining illnesses but reported recent treatment for gonorrhea and chlamydia ure-thritis. The patient also disclosed that he had engaged in un-protected anal sex with multiple partners from different ethnic-ities， mainly Hispanic. He had no recent travel history， but had been to Japan 30 years ago. He had also traveled previously to\n\n【45】France， Italy， and Turkey. His last trip out of the country was to Greece three years prior to his current presentation. He had a remote history of intravenous drug use and admitted to daily use of crystal methamphetamine. His past medical history was also significant for borderline personality disorder.\n\n【46】On arrival to the hospital， the patient was afebrile and had a blood pressure of 96/62 mm Hg with a heart rate of 87 beats per minute， and normal respiratory rate and oxygen satura-tion. He appeared cachectic， pale， and fatigued. He was alert and oriented with no nuchal rigidity and no focal neurolog-ic deficits. No oropharyngeal rash was seen. Respiratory and cardiovascular examinations were unremarkable. His abdo-men was soft but with diffuse tenderness on deep palpation. There was no abdominal distension or ascites.\n\n【47】Initial laboratory work disclosed mild hypokalemia (3.3 mmol/L)， hypomagnesemia (1.4 mg/dL， hypocalcemia (6.2 mg/dL)， hypo-albuminemia (2.6 g/dl)， and anemia and eosinophilia (1，000eosinophils/mcL). He had otherwise normal creatinine， aspar-tate aminotransferase，alanine aminotransferase， total biliru-bin， lipase， and white blood cell count. The only imaging test performed was a computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen with intravenous contrast， which showed circumferential wall thickening of the rectosigmoid area with mild stranding in the adjacent fat and multiple small perirectal lymph nodes， sug-gestive of mild proctocolitis of the rectosigmoid.\n\n【48】Intravenous (M) fluids were administered and electrolytes were repleted. He was started on ciprofloxacin 800 mg IV twice dai-ly and metronidazole 500 mg l three times daily. Diagnostic workup for infectious disease and inflammatory bowel dis ease were sent： sedimentation rate， stool pathogens by PCR， Clostridium difficile EIA， cryptosporidium， giardia antigen， and cyclospora and isospora. His sedimentation was 12 mm/hour and only the fecal leukocyte count test was positive.\n\n【49】Because the patient's symptoms were only minimally improv-ing with current management， a colonoscopy was performed. During the colonoscopy， the rectal examination revealed nor-mal sphincter tone without palpable rectal or anal abnormal-ities. Diffuse moderate inflammation characterized by edema， erythema， and confluent ulcerations was found in the rectum and in the recto-sigmoid colon. Biopsies were taken with cold forceps for histology. Bowel preparation was inadequate， with copious quantities of semi-solid stool all along the sigmoid co-lon to the cecum. Stool samples were collected for ova and par-asite examination but were found to be negative.\n\n【50】Colonic biopsies revealed fragments of larvae/worm within the crypts compatible with S. stercoralis along with increased lymphocytes and eosinophils in the background (Figures 1-3). Rectal biopsy showed colonic mucosa， a polypoid fragment\n\n【51】Vazquez Guillamet LJ. et al.：\n\n【52】Figure 1. Sigmoid colon with larvae in crypts (H&E 100x).\n\n【53】Figure 2. Sigmoid colon biopsy larvae (H&E 400x).\n\n【54】Figure 3. Sigmoid colon larvae； background plasma cells， lymphocytes， and eosinophils (H&E 200x).\n\n【55】with chronic inflammation， ulceration and possible pseudo-membranes with acute inflammation.\n\n【56】The patient's symptomatology improved after therapy was switched to a 10-day regimen of ivermectin 12，000 mcg by mouth daily.\n\n【57】Discussion\n\n【58】Clinical presentation of Strongyloides infection\n\n【59】Strongyloidiasis is a parasitic disease that affects tens of mil-lions of people worldwide. S. stercoralis is the pathogen re-sponsible for the most common form of the disease， where-as S. fuelleborni is responsible for the so-called“swollen belly syndrome\" in infants from Papua New Guinea and sub-Saha-ran Africa \\[1\\]. We present the case of an HIV-infected individ-ual， born and raised in the northeastern USA， who was admit-ted for S. stercoralis related diarrhea and for whom the main potential risk factors were anal intercourse and a distant his-tory of travel to Japan.\n\n【60】Most S. stercoralis infections occur secondary to skin contact with contaminated soils. However， transmission of S. sterco-ralis through solid organ transplantation， nosocomial spread， oral-anal sex， and rectal intercourse have also been report-ed \\[1\\]. Risk factors associated with S. stercoralis infection are HlV infection， low socioeconomic status， alcoholism， white race， and male gender \\[2，3\\].\n\n【61】In the classic infective cycle， soils become contaminated by free-living filariform larvae originating from human feces. They can infect their host through contact with exposed skin and subsequently reach the pulmonary alveolar spaces via affer-ent circulation. Once in the lungs， the larvae can ascend to-wards the pharynx to be swallowed into the small intestine， where they develop into adult worms \\[1\\]. What makes S. ster-coralis a unique helminth is that， while embedded in the mu-cosa， the adult female worm reproduces through parthenogen-esis \\[4\\]. Twenty-five to 30 days after infection， embryonated eggs reach the lumen and rapidly hatch to release non-infec-tive rhabditiform larvae that are excreted with the feces of-ten resulting in contamination of the soil. An alternative cycle happens when rhabditiform larvae turn into pathogenic filar-iform larvae while they are still inside the host intestinal tract. In that stage， they can penetrate the colonic mucosa or peri-anal skin， perpetuating the parasitism for decades through a mechanism known as autoinfection \\[1，5\\].\n\n【62】In acute strongyloidiasis infection， dermatologic irritation at the site of entrance followed by respiratory symptoms and gas-trointestinal discomfort can be observed. Once in the chron-ic stage of the disease， most patients are either asymptomat-ic or suffer from non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms such as intermittent diarrhea， constipation， vomiting， or borboryg-mus. Other symptoms that may be associated with chronic in-fection are respiratory distress mimicking asthma， pruritus ani， and unexplained rash (larva currens rash and urticarial rash) \\[2\\]. In a study performed by Nabha et. al， gastrointesti-nal symptoms did not differ between S. stercoralis seropositive\n\n【63】and seronegative AIDS patients， with eosinophilia the only test found to have some utility in the diagnosis of patients not tak-ing steroids (p=0.02) \\[6\\] On the other hand， a study performed by Hochberg et al. found a significant association between weight loss and strongyloidiasis in HlV infected patients (OR3.1，95%1.4-7.2)\\[7\\].\n\n【64】An acceleration of the autoinfective cycle can lead to hyper-infection syndrome， where affected individuals present signs and symptoms attributable to a severe increase in the body-larval burden. This may be associated with disseminated dis-ease， which implies the direct involvement of any organ aside from the pulmonary autoinfective cycle. Gram-negative bac-teremia represents a common complication secondary to gas-trointestinal translocation \\[2，8\\].\n\n【65】In our patient， weight loss， diarrhea， and abdominal pain were the predominant features. There were no signs of disseminat-ed disease and larval burden did not appear to be elevated. We believe that the improvement of our patient’s symptoms with ivermectin treatment points towards symptomatic infec-tion rather than an incidental finding. This could be a case of either subacute or chronic infection. As it has been described in other case reports， clinical disease can appear as late as 60vears after the initial infection\\[61.\n\n【66】Several studies have found an association between HIV and increased risk for S. stercoralis infection \\[3，9\\]. Data coming from clinical and autopsy series in Africa， South America， and the USA showed very rare cases of S. stercoralis dissemination and hyperinfection syndrome despite vast numbers of people with co-infections. This led to the dismantling of the old be-lief that S. stercoralis dissemination and hyperinfection syn-drome was an AlDS-defining illness \\[2，3，9，10\\]. The two main risk factors for developing life-threatening hyperinfection syn-drome are the use of corticosteroids and co-infection by hu-man T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HLTV-1) \\[9\\]. Interestingly， among HIV-infected individuals， those who lack eosinophilia during hyperinfection seem to have worse prognosis \\[2，11\\]\n\n【67】Prevalence and distribution of strongyloidiasis in the USA\n\n【68】S. stercoralis can be found in any continent except Antarctica \\[5\\]. Tropical and subtropical regions are the most affected， with a prevalence of 85% in lower socioeconomic population \\[4，5\\]. In the USA， rural Appalachia and some areas of the southeast are endemic regions. However， most reported infections have involved travelers and veterans returning from endemic areas outside of the USA as well as immigrant populations living in northern urban centers \\[7\\].\n\n【69】A study on global distribution and risk factors of S. stercoralis published in 2013 by Schar et al. reported the following data\n\n【70】on prevalence rates of strongyloidiasis in the USA： 40% (95%Cl， 37.8%-43%) among immigrants， 49.2% (95% C10.1-99.9%) in hospitalized individuals and 2.7%(95% CI， 2.4-3%) in the community \\[3\\]. Twenty-two surveys were included in the anal-ysis and test sensitivity was taken into account. High hospi-tal rates seem to be related to low power studies but also to higher prevalence of at-risk individuals and use of high-sen-sitivity diagnostic methods when compared to community-based studies \\[3\\].\n\n【71】While there is a lack of national data regarding S. stercoralis prevalence in HIV-infected individuals living in the USA， it is presumed that most of this population acquired the parasit-ic infection either from their country of origin or through per-son to person contact in USA territory. An article from 1987reported a relatively high prevalence of strongyloidiasis (3.9%) among sexually-active homosexual men in the USA \\[6\\]. More recently， in the study performed by Hochberg et al. in 2011，26% of the 128 foreign-born HIV-infected individuals in the USA were found to have antibodies against S. stercoralis \\[7\\]. A different study conducted by Nabha et al. in 2012 in a non-endemic urban USA AIDS cohort found that 25% of the study participants were strongyloides seropositive by CrAg-ELISA testing. Interestingly， only 68% of the participants were for-eign-born \\[6\\]. This data suggests that person-to-person sex-ual contact may be a significant route of transmission of S. stercoralis parasitism in non-endemic areas of the USA， and we believe that this may be a plausible source of infection in our patient's case.\n\n【72】Including our case， we were able to identify only 12 cases of HIV-infected patients diagnosed with strongyloidiasis in the continental USA \\[4，5，8，10-15\\]. Cases where the exact location of diagnosis was not specified but the authors were from a hospi-tal in the continental USA were also included (Table 1)\\[12，13\\]. In our review of the literature， nine patients suffered from hy-perinfection syndrome \\[4，5，8，10-12，14\\]， two from disseminat-ed disease \\[13，15\\] and our case was the only published case report of possible subacute/chronic infection. Among the cas-es cited， clinical presentation was diverse. Respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common present-ing complaints. All the patients (except our patient)， had AIDS. Only one of four patients with eosinophilia and hyperinfection syndrome survived. Exposure to steroids was reported in two cases. One patient had received steroid therapy in the setting of Pneumocystis pneumonia treatment \\[12\\]. The other patient developed hyperinfection syndrome and survived after treat-ment. One patient was on chemotherapy for the treatment of Burkitt lymphoma and died from disseminated disease \\[15\\]. Seven patients developed concomitant bacteremia or menin-gitis； all were fatal cases \\[8，10，13-15\\]. Diagnosis was achieved through different techniques. Stool analysis was positive in only four patients. Overall， a 75% death rate was observed.\n\n【73】Table 1.

Early diagnosis of S. stercoralis is important because most helminth-related deaths in the USA are due to this parasite \\[5\\]. Detection of Strongyloides larvae is the gold standard for diagnosis； how-ever， it lacks sensitivity due to low and intermittent shedding in stools. A single stool examination only detects about 30%of cases and therefore repeated stool examinations are recom-mended with an increase in sensitivity to 50% once three stool samples have been examined， and further increased to almost100% sensitivity when seven stool samples are examined \\[16\\].\n\n【78】To further increase the sensitivity of stool testing， a new fecal antigen test was developed by Goncalves et al. utilizing ELISA to detect S. venezuelensis coproantigens in fecal samples of rats. This possibly represents the initial steps in the develop-ment of rapid coproantigen detection kits to diagnose stron-gyloides infection in humans \\[17\\].\n\n【79】Various serologic techniques have been developed during the last few decades to improve diagnostic sensitivity， including indirect immunofluorescence microscopy， gelatin particle ag-glutination， immunoblot， and enzyme-linked immunoassays(ELISA). ELISA has been used most extensively. Despite excel-lent sensitivity， results are often difficult to interpret due to an inability to distinguish between current， resolved， and past in-fections \\[18\\]. Serology can be falsely negative in cases of im-munosuppression and in the presence of low titers \\[19\\]，and falsely positive due to cross-reactivity with other helminths \\[18\\].\n\n【80】In the last few years， newer diagnostic tools and molecular methods have been developed to more efficiently and ac-curately diagnose Strongyloides infection. Newer techniques such as the luciferase immunoprecipitation system assay (LIPS) based on a 31-kDa recombinant antigen (NIE) from S.stercora-lis and/or the recombinant S. stercoralis immunoreactive anti-gen (SsIR)， the NIE-ELISA and CrudeAg-ELISA were all compared with comprehensive stool evaluation by Kwolewiecki et al. and have shown promise. NIE-LIPS showed the highest sensitiv-ity and specificity of the serologic assays and demonstrated no cross-reactivity with other soil-transmitted helminths \\[20\\].\n\n【81】Real-time PCR directed to target the small subunit of the rRNA gene can now be applied to stool samples \\[21\\]. When com-pared to traditional parasitological and microscopic methods， quantitative PCR has an up to eight times increase in diagnos-tic yield \\[22-24\\]. However， high cost and its unavailability out-side the laboratory setting are some factors limiting its utility.\n\n【82】In 2016， Lodh et al. showed for the first time that parasite DNA could be detected in filtered urine via PCR. They compared PCR\n\n【83】on urine residue with current standard stool examination tech-niques. This method detected a significantly higher number of cases of S.stercoralis compared with standard stool examina-tion techniques. However， in 6.4% of cases， larvae was seen in the stool， but no DNA was amplified from urine. This meth-od is promising but needs further validation \\[25\\].\n\n【84】Updates on the treatment of Strongyloides infection\n\n【85】The drug of choice for treatment of strongyloidiasis is ivermec-tin， with albendazole as an alternative medication. Back in the1960s， thiabendazole was commonly used for the treatment of S. stercoralis. However， thiabendazole is now rarely used due to the availability of more efficacious and better tolerat-ed medications \\[26，27\\].\n\n【86】In the immunocompromised patient with S. stercoralis hyper-infection or disseminated disease， a crucial part of the treat-ment resides on reversal of immunosuppression. This means that in some cases， the dose of immunosuppressant therapy is decreased or the use of steroids is tapered off or discontinued.\n\n【87】When patients with hyperinfection or disseminated disease are not able to take oral medications due to altered mental status or ileus， several non-FDA approved forms of administrations had been tried， most of them coming from experiences in vet-erinary medicine. The possible regimens include subcutane-ous \\[28，29\\]， rectal \\[30\\]， or parenteral ivermectin formulation.\n\n【88】Some experts recommend that the optimal length of treatment is between five to seven days for disseminated disease using either ivermectin monotherapy or ivermectin with albenda-zole. The alternative to a fixed-length therapy is to adjust the duration until the clinical symptoms completely resolve and daily stool examinations have been negative for at least two weeks (the duration of one autoinfection cycle). In some im-munocompromised patients， a prolonged course of ivermec-tin therapy may be warranted \\[31\\].\n\n【89】In cases of refractory strongyloidiasis， combined longer-term ivermectin and albendazole has been effective \\[32\\]. Monthly doses of ivermectin could be given for at least six months in patients with ongoing immunosuppression that had hyperin-fection syndrome. It is recommended that blood cultures be obtained in the setting of hyperinfection syndrome， and em-piric broad spectrum antibiotics to cover enteric gram-nega-tive bacteria should be considered.\n\n【90】Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressant medication given to patients mainly to prevent organ rejection after transplan-tation. Interestingly， it was discovered that it had anti-Stron-gyloides effect when it was used to induce immunosuppres-sion in dogs infected with S. stercoralis. Subsequent studies\n\n【91】showed that cyclosporine eradicated S. ratti from rats \\[33\\]. A later study reported that a single dose given to rats reduced the number of larvae in the stools by approximately 50% \\[34\\]. Although it has been demonstrated to have anti-helminthic effects， the use of cyclosporine for treatment of S. stercoralis infection in humans is currently not recommended primarily because of its immunosuppressive effects.\n\n【92】Other promising agents include amino-acetonitrile derivatives(AADs). AADs are a class of low molecular mass compounds bearing different aryloxy and aroy. moieties on an amino-ace-tonitrile core. They offer a class of novel synthetic compounds with high activity against gastrointestinal nematodes，includ-ing resistant isolates \\[35\\]. Its use has been limited to live-stock/veterinary medicine.\n\n【93】References：\n\n【94】1\\.

What makes our case peculiar is that most case reports of S. stercoralis infection are from patients with low CD4 count and from immigrants from endemic countries. In contrast， our patient had a relatively high CD4 count， un-detectable viral load， and was born and raised in the north-eastern USA. Carriers of S. stercoralis may remain asymptom-atic for many years. Although it is possible that our patient may have been infected with 5. stercoralis from his previous travels， anal sex with other men may also be a plausible route of trans mission.\n\n【109】The diagnosis of S. stercoralis infection remains a challenge. Our patient's stool ova and parasite examination was unre-vealing and the diagnosis of S. stercoralis infection was found only through colonic biopsy. Clinicians must consider parasit-ic diseases such as S. stercoralis among HIV-infected patients with persistent diarrhea and eosinophilia， especially among men having sex with men， regardless of ethnicity or recent travel history.\n\n【110】14\\.

Curcuma Longa (C. Longa) has been known to affect in improving skin texture due to exogenous effects associated with dry skin. Objective This study aims to determine the effect of C.Longa 0.5% extract on sebum composition and skin moisture in patients with dry skin associated with premature ageing. The sample used was 13women with a twice-daily application on the upper and lower arms of C.Longa extract and cream base ingredients as controls. Therapy response was measured using a skin analyser at weeks 1， 3 and 6. Methods The data in this study was obtained and will be processed by using computerised statistic program. The analysis used is descriptive analysis for mean and standard deviation of the moisturisation score and frequency distribution on criteria of sebum composition of stratum corneum at various time of observation. The amount of change of score with the Paired test， a difference of score change using Mann Whitney Test and to assess the difference of distribution using X2 test. Result Provision of C.Longa extract of 0.5% can improve sebum composition and skin moisture in dry skin patients when used for at least six weeks. Conclusions and recommendations Significant changes were obtained in the third week. The change in sebum composition by 87.5% was obtained at the sixth week. Although the change is only 50% in moisture score， it is enough to prove that there is an improvement in skin moisture. So we consider the use of longer than six weeks.\n\n【3】KEYWORDS： Curcuma Longa 0.5% extract， skin moisture， dry skin， skin sebum\n\n【4】INTRODUCTION\n\n【5】Dry skin is a problem for millions of people and often causes discomfort and even psychological stress. Clinical symptoms of dry skin include tight and stiff， rough， dull， scaly， itchy， redness and even pain. Dry skin mainly describes abnormalities in the stratum corneum of the epidermis.\n\n【6】Copyright @ 2019 by the Bulgarian Association of Young Surgeons\n\n【7】DOI：10.5455/IJMRCR.curcuma-longa-sebum-dry-skin\n\n【8】First Received： April 30， 2018\n\n【9】Accepted： May 03，2018\n\n【10】Manuscript Associate Editor： Cvetanka Hristova (BG)\n\n【11】Reviewers： Ivan Inkov (BG)\n\n【12】1Rani Bachmid， Department of Dermatology and Venereology， Faculty of Medicine， Hasanuddin University， Makassar， Indonesia E-mail：ranibachmid@yahoo.com\n\n【13】Various studies were conducted to obtain optimal dry skin management. One of them is by producing moisturiser that effectively increases the water content in the stratum corneum and. Even the market for moisturising products in the United States was ranked the most significant cosmetics sales of 1 billion dollars per year.\\[2\\]\n\n【14】Moisturizers work with an occlusive and humectant com-position as well as components in Natural Moisturizing Factor(NMF). Occlusive compositions are physically blocking water loss from the surface of the skin while the humectant composi-tion works by pulling water into the skin. The moisture-guarded skin can defend against the damage caused by the ageing pro-cess.3 In a study by Piccioni et al. (2017)， it was found that anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant moisturisers increased the secretion of sebum and hydration significantly and reduced erythema in subjects and increased moisture. \\[4\\]\n\n【15】In this study， we use yellow turmeric extract (Curcuma Longa) which has shown its usefulness as an antioxidant， anti-inflammatory， anti-carcinogenic， and antimutagenic.\\[5\\] Thus， these anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects will affect skin moisture.\n\n【16】Scientific research that spans over four decades has confirmed the pharmacological effects of Curcuma Longa (C. Longa) and its ability as a chemopreventive agent and potential therapeu-tic agent against several chronic diseases. Curcuma Longa， al-most two centuries old in scientific history， and still attracts researchers from around the world. Starting from 1815， when curcumin was first isolated from C. Longa， there were only a few reports until 1970 on chemical structure， synthesis， biochemical activity and antioxidants. However， after a report by Aggarwal and colleagues in the 1990s on its potential effects as anticancer， the research rate of C.Longa has overgrown， with more than14，000 citations.\\[6\\]\n\n【17】Curcuma Longa has been known as the scavenger of most ROS， thus functioning as an antioxidant in normal cells. ROS contains oxidant free radicals and molecular oxidants. Free rad-ical oxidants play a role in hydrogen abstraction and also in electron transfer reactions. The three active ingredients C.Longa can cause oxidative.6 In addition to potent antioxidants as ef-fective as ROS scavenger， C. Longa also can inhibit lipid per-oxidation. \\[7\\] In the extract， C. Longa obtained some free fatty acids such as palmitic acid， oleic acid， linoleic acid， palmitoleic acid， stearic acid and myristic acid and p-sitosterol and sterol stigma which contribute to the control of sebum production to moisturise the skin.\\[8\\]\n\n【18】Madalene Heng from America has been researching the target of the C.Longa signal pathway as the basis for anti-photoaging and anticancer therapy. Application of C.Longa gel on the sub-ject of telangiectasis and pigment changes gives change after six months application. Other cases were found to change af-ter 6-month of C. longa gel application on actinic keratosis. In patients with wrinkles， telangiectasis and erythema due to expo-sure to sunlight， it improves after ten months of use of C.Longa gel after sunscreen application. In this study found C. Longa has been shown to protect from trauma due to sunlight by reducing oxidative stress and suppress inflammation. C. Longa’s ability to block multiple targets on this pathway serves as a basis that C. Longa has potential in the use of phytochemicals in photoaging skin and photocarcinogenesis. Inhibitor effects of C. longa on inflammation， premature ageing and photocarcinogenesis.\\[9\\]\n\n【19】Kaur and Nerves (2011)， researches the effects of C.Longa on skin damage from ultraviolet radiation by measuring the levels of sebum and skin moisture. Kaur and Nerves using a0.5%-2% cream extract of C.Longa on the subject with the same sun exposure activity for four weeks， showed elevated levels of sebum and moisture. C.Longa contains a moisture component that increases the penetration of the cream into the skin layer that keeps moisture and sebum levels of the skin.\\[5\\] This study aims to determine the effect of C.Longa 0.5% extract on sebum levels and skin moisture in patients with dry skin related to premature ageing.\n\n【20】MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n【21】This research was conducted in RS. Wahidin Sudirohusodo(RSWS) and the network as a place of sampling which took place from December 2017 until January 2018. This study did not receive any financial support from any institutions.\n\n【22】This research uses clinical trial research design. The research\n\n【23】variables consist of a free variable (Cream Extract C. Longa0，5%)， the dependent variable (Change of moisturisation score)， moderator variable (exposure of ultraviolet ray)， and variable between (change of sebum composition).\n\n【24】The population used is women aged 25-40 years with dry skin residing in RSWS and its network. The study sample was the en-tire accessible population that met the inclusion criteria. Patients who are willing to be samples of this research then fill out a state-ment of consent by signing informed consent then conducted data collection. Data collection is done by interview/anamnesis， physical examination， and application of the sample\n\n【25】The data in this study obtained will be processed by using electronic statistic program. The analysis used is descriptive analysis for mean and standard deviation of the moisturisation score and frequency distribution on criteria of sebum compo-sition of stratum corneum at various time of observation. The magnitude of the moisturisation score change and the sebum composition criteria at weeks 1.3 and six were tested with the Paired test in each group while the difference test of moisture score and the sebum composition criteria at weeks 1.3 and 6used Mann Whitney Test. To assess the differences in humidity distribution and the normal sebum composition criteria of the skins of the three groups were used X2 test.\n\n【26】RESULTS\n\n【27】This study took the sample of 13 women aged 25-40 years (table1). To know the effect of C.Longa 0，5% extract in the change\n\n【28】Table 1 Sample characteristics\n\n| Characteristics  |  | N  | %  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age  | 25-30  | 6  | 46  |\n|  | 31-35  | 5  | 38  |\n|  | 36-40  | 2  | 8  |\n| Occupation  | College students  | 69  |  |\n|  | 9  |  |  |\n|  | Swasta  | 4  | 31  |\n\n【30】of sebum composition compared with the control was done some test that is sebum composition analysis between group of C.Longa 0，5% extract with control at the beginning before treatment (table 2) and analysis of sebum composition change based on each stage of observation (table 3 and figure 1) In table2 it can be seen that most sebum criteria Little (L)， Little (M)and Much (L) are only small； respectively the percentage (84.6%VS7.7% vs 7.7%). Each is evenly distributed in both groups； Little(L) respectively 28.2% in C.Longa extract group and 28.2% in control. Similarly to the criteria sebum Little (M) and Much (L). X2 test results show p = 1，000 (p> 0，05)； meaning there is no significant distribution difference based on the sebum criteria in both groups. To see differences in the alteration of sebum criteria for both groups at each observation step (duration of use)； then for analysis； the sebum criteria analysed were sebum with the Little (L) criterion， the number of samples most likely to be analyzed (n=40). The results of the analysis can be seen in table 3 and figure 1.\n\n【31】The change/improvement of the sebum conditions in the C.Longa extract group was faster than the control group， either\n\n|  |  |  | Early Sebum Criteria  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  | Little (L)  | Little (M)  | Much(L)  | Total  |\n| Group  | C.Longa  | Total  | 22  | 2  | 2  | 26  |\n|  | extract  | % of total  | 28.2%  | 2，6%  | 2.6%  | 33.3%  |\n|  | Control  | Total  | 22  | 2  | 2  | 26  |\n|  |  | % of total  | 28.2%  | 2，6%  | 2，6%  | 33.3%  |\n| Total  |  | Total  | 66  | 6  | 6  | 78  |\n|  |  | % of total  | 84.7%  | 7.7%  | 7.7%  | 100.0%  |\n| X2→P=1，000  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n【33】at the end of week 1 (10.0% vs 0.0%)， week 3 (50.0% vs 31.3%) and week 6 (87.5% vs 43.8%). Although there was a difference in percentage change of sebum composition criteria between the two groups at the end of the 1st， 3rd and 6th weeks， but only significantly different (p <0.05) at the end of week 6. (Table 3).\n\n【34】The percentage change of Sebum criteria from Little (L) to Much (H) in the C.Longa extract group increased almost linearly with duration of intervention and was higher than for changes in the control group； this suggest6666s that the C.Longa extract ac-celerates the repair of skin sebum conditions rather than controls(Figure1).\n\n【35】Figure 1： Criteria change the percentage of Sebum from Little (L) to Much (H) based on observation stage (length of intervention) in both groups\n\n【36】To observe the effect of C.Longa 0，5% extract for skin moisture score change， there are several tests that is the skin moisture score change in both groups at each stage of usage (table 4 and figure 2) and the analysis of normal skin moisture distribution category at each stage of usage (figure 3 and table 5).\n\n【37】At the end of week-1， there was a significant increase in skin moisture score in the 0.5%(P <0.05) group of C.Longa extract on\n\n【38】Figure 2： Change of skin moisturization in each group and stage of observation\n\n【39】average by 0.38±0.77 from 34.25±1.62 to 34.63±1.41； whereas in the control group there was no significant increase (p> 0.05) averaging 0.04±0.55 from 34.08±1.50 to 34.13±1.48. Further-more， at the end of the 3-week increase in skin moisture score became even higher in each group (p <0.05). In the extract group C. Longa 0.5% increase in the score of 2.70±1.22 from 33.90±1.45to 36.60±0.88 while the control only increases of 1.20±1，51from33.75±1.33 to 34.95±1.40. At week six it increased by 4.80±2.38， and in the control group， there was an increase of 2.50±1.79from 33.75±1.33 to 36.25±1.59 (Table 4).\n\n【40】There was an increase in skin moisture score in both groups based on length of treatment. A score of skin moisture in group given C.Longa extract had the highest curve and lowest control. The moisture-level curve of the C.Longa extract group is above the control curve， since the end of week-1 and is getting sepa-rated by the end of week-6. This means that the increase in skin moisture score in the C.Longa extract group is 0.5% faster than control either at week 1，3 or 6. (Figure 2)\n\n【41】Increased skin moisture scores occurred in the C.Longa ex-tract group from the end of 1-week， and the increase in scores was higher at the end of 3 weeks and more significant by the end of the 6th week than the increase in skin moisture score in the control group.)\n\n【42】At the end of the 3rd week， the extract of C.Longa 0.5% in dry skin patients has only reached 5% which can be categorised\n\n【43】Table 3 Sebum Criteria change based on observation (length of intervention) in both groups\n\n| Groups  | Criteria Change Presentation of Litle (L) to Much (H)  |  |  | P  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | End of Week1  | End of week3  | End of week6  |  |\n| C.Longa Extract  | 10，0%  | 50，0%  | 875%  | 0，027  |\n| Control  | 0，0%  | 313%  | 43，8%  |  |\n| X2 test， Similar superscribe on the same column shows insignificant change P>0，05， while different superscribe shows significant change P<0，05  |  |  |  |  |\n\n【45】Table 4 Change of skin moisturization in each group and stage of observation\n\n| The range of Observation Stage  | Group  | Mean±SD Score Skin Moisture  |  |  | Pvalue  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  | Before  | After  | Difference  |  |\n| End of Week 1  | C.L extract (n=24)  | 34，25±1，62  | 34，63±1，41  | 0，38±0，77  | 0，026  |\n|  | Control (n=24)  | 34，08±1，50  | 34，13±1，48  | 0，04±0，55  | 0，714  |\n| Start of week 3  | Extract C.L(n=20)  | 33，90±145  | 36，60±0，88  | 2，70±1，22  | <0，001  |\n|  | Control (n=20)  | 33，75±1，33  | 34，95±1，40  | 1，20±1，51  | 0，001  |\n| Start of week 6  | C.L extract (n=20)  | 33，90±1，45  | 38，70±1，63  | 4，80±2，38  | <0，001  |\n|  | Control (n=20)  | 33，75±1，33  | 36，25±1，59  | 2，50±1，79  | <0，001  |\n| \\*Paired sample t-test  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n【47】\\*Paired sample t-test\n\n【48】Figure 3： Increased Skin Moisture Score at the end of week 1，3， and 6 in three groups\n\n【49】as normal skin moisture and is no different from the control (the essential ingredients of the cream).

This study was conducted for six weeks where the initial examination before the application of cream and then after the application of the cream of week 1， 3 and 6. This corresponds to a skin regeneration process that lasts for 21 to 28days. According to Nelson and Thiboutot (2012)， the period of the sebaceous glands in removing lipids (holocrine secretion) is21-25 days.\\[10\\]\n\n【54】Premature ageing can be caused by the presence of free radi-cals that can cause oxidative stress that triggers premature age-ing， one of which decreases sebum gland function. The com-position of sebum on the surface of the skin， where it consists of triglycerides， free fatty acids， wax， squalene， sterols and gly-cophospholipids. In human sebum plays an essential role in protecting the skin from microorganisms and hazardous chemi-cals. It also potentiates the skin’s emollient function by retaining water. Excess sebum production， on the other hand，results in oily skin that can cause acne and seborrhoeic dermatitis.\n\n【55】Research by Zaman and Akhtar (2013)， aims to formulate\n\n【56】a cream containing turmeric extract and evaluate its effect on sebum secretion in human volunteers. The volunteers come to the laboratory every two weeks for measurement. On the sebum， the face suggests that along with other applications of turmeric for medicinal purposes to improve skin conditions， potent extract creams can be used to control sebum production in human skin. People with excessively oily skin or acne will be beneficial.\n\n【57】The skin moisture content was found to be significant at week3 and increased again at week six on the use of both C.Longa and control extracts. This is by a study by Plianbangchang et al.(2013)， which found the anti-oxidant effects of C.Longa extracts that can maintain skin moisture and elasticity. The study was conducted on 33 women with C.Longa for four weeks on the face.11\\]\n\n【58】UV plays a significant role in causing premature ageing， where early signs can be dry skin.11 UV radiation is a generator of ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) that play a role in causing biological effects.\n\n【59】Dysfunction of lipid matrix due to exposure to sunlight causes premature ageing characterised by dry skin， wrinkles and freckles on the skin. For this purpose， moisturisers generally contain lipids and mixtures that are emollient， humectant and or occlusive. Moisturizers containing anti-inflammatory and antioxidants can minimise the inflammatory reaction and modu-late vascular reactivity. In the study by Piccioni et al. found that moisturisers containing anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidants in-creased sebum and hydration secretion significantly where the reduction of erythema in the subject and increased moisture.\\[4\\]\n\n【60】Curcuma Longa as a phosphorylase kinase inhibitor plays a role in preventing UV-induced trauma by minimising post-traumatic inflammation.\\[9\\] The lipid layer on Curcuma Longa can penetrate the thickest part of the skin which retains skin moisture by maintaining hydration in the epidermal stratum corneum.12\\]\n\n【61】In this study， there was a significant improvement in C.Longa extract preparation compared with control. In general， cur-cumin produces anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative activity. Polyphenols in C.Longa act as potent antioxidants and ROS breakers such as free radicals， superoxide radicals， hydroxyl rad-icals， hydrogen peroxidase and single oxygen. A very beneficial effect on moisture is obtained from the alignment of antioxi-dants， anti-inflammation， and protective agents contained in the preparation， in this case， the lipid content and mixing agent extracts.\\[12\\]\n\n【62】However， there are some limitations in this study. First， the treatment period in this study may not be sufficient to show the optimal THD extract towards sebum concentration and skin moisture. This study also only examines one type of preparation and concentration. Further studies with longer treatment period comparing different types of preparations and concentrations need to be conducted.\n\n【63】CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n【64】Researchers concluded that dry skin does not only occur in peo-ple with skin disorders but related to environmental factors. Therapy is also aimed at improving the function of a barrier to reduce patient discomfort. Curcuma Longa as an antioxi-dant and anti-inflammatory role in sebum and skin moisture to maintain skin hydration. At week six it was found that the improvement of sebum composition was 87.5% and the skin moisture was only 50%， but it was enough to prove that the use\n\n【65】could provide improvement. Extracts of C.Longa 0.5% faster-improved sebum composition and skin moisture compared to controls. The authors suggest that follow-up studies with higher levels of turmeric cream， longer time， preparations and different parameters.\n\n【66】AUTHORS'STATEMENTS\n\n【67】COMPETING INTERESTS\n\n【68】The authors declare no conflict of interest.\n\n【69】REFERENCES\n\n【70】1\\.

BDIs are usually diagnosed after surgery， although intraoperative recognition of biliary leakage， ei-ther by direct visualization or after intraoperative cholan-giography， has been reported in 10-30% of cases \\[1\\]. BDIs may manifest as biliary obstruction， biliary leakage or as a combination of both.\n\n【27】A BDI should be suspected in patients who do not show improvement after surgery， and in patients with persisting symptoms such as abdominal pain， abdominal distention， nausea and vomiting \\[2\\]. Presented here is a case of a pa-tient treated for an iatrogenic BDI inflicted in another cen-ter after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\n\n【28】CASE REPORT\n\n【29】A 53-year-old male patient underwent a laparoscopic chole-cystectomy in another center for cholelithiasis. He was re-ferred to our hospital 3 days following surgery， after devel-oping progressive abdominal distention， abdominal pain， nausea and vomiting. Initial evaluation in the emergen-cy department revealed the presence of generalized ab-dominal tenderness. Results of laboratory tests were un-remarkable except for an elevated white blood cell count(12.000/mm)and elevated serum levels of alkaline phos-phatase (265 U/L)， gamma glutamyl transferase (95 U/L)， total and direct bilirubin (5.7 mg/dl and 3.6 mg/dl， respec-tively). Abdominal ultrasonography revealed the presence of circumscribed intraabdominal collection in the gallblad-der bed (5x4 cm). With preliminary diagnosis of a BDI， the patient was admitted for surgery. BDI in the form of loss of tissue of the middle hepatic canal was observed (Strasberg type D). Absence of signs of sepsis or peritonitis prompted performance of a hepaticojejunostomy. However， 5 days lat-er the patient became septic and was reoperated upon with a suspicion of anastomotic leakage from the hepaticojeju-nostomy. Widespread inflammatory and ischemic changes were observed， which prompted undoing of the anastomo-sis and resection of the affected jejunal segment. Bridging of the affect area of the bile duct was achieved by placing a T-tube， which provided bile duct continuity (Figure 1).\n\n【30】After showing marked improvement， the patient was dis-charged with the T-tube. Six months later， the tube was re-moved by ERCP followed by placement of a stent after bal-loon dilatation of the stenosis， which developed at the level of the hilum. After another 6 months， the placed stent was removed and no signs of stenosis were observed. Three years after surgery， the patient was doing well， without any abnormalities on serum biochemistry. No stenosis was ob-served on an MRCP (Figure 2).\n\n【31】DISCUSSION\n\n【32】Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with higher rates of BDI when compared to open cholecystectomy \\[3\\]. Known risk factors for the development of BDIs are obesity， advanced age， presence of adhesions from previous surgery， ongoing inflammation or infection， anatomical variations， and bleeding \\[4\\]. Technical difficulties due to at least one\n\n【33】Figure 1. Bile duct continuity was achieved after bridging with a T-tube.\n\n【34】Figure 2. MRCP performed 3 years after surgery showing fibrotic healing of the bile duct (green arrow) at the site of injury.\n\n【35】of the above mentioned factors are encountered in 70% of patients with BDIs \\[1\\]. The management ofinjuries depends on the site and the type of the injury. Available treatment options include T-tubes， primary repair， end-to-end anasto-mosis， choledochoduodenostomy and hepaticojejunostomy.\n\n【36】Early diagnosis， type of injury， and prompt identification of the presence of a concomitant vascular injury increase the likelihood of successful treatment. However， only 10-30%of BDIs are recognized during surgery \\[5\\]. Conversion to open surgery is warranted in the event of direct visualiza-tion of biliary leakage or confirmation of suspected leak-age by intraoperative cholangiography. Repair of the injury should preferably be performed by an experienced hepato-biliary surgeon. This approach has been shown to reduce morbidity， duration of hospital stay， and cost \\[6\\].\n\n【37】As in our case， failure to show improvement during the ear-ly postoperative period， particularly in the presence of pro-gressive abdominal distention， nausea， vomiting， fever and VOI 10abdominal pain， should raise a suspicion of BDI. If an inju-ry is recognized during the early postoperative period (<1week)， and the patient is stable with no signs of an intraab-dominal infection， early repair may be warranted，depend-ing on the type of injury \\[1\\]. Our patient was diagnosed early， and the absence of an intraabdominal infection or\n\n【38】generalized peritonitis prompted performance of a hepat-icojejunostomy due to the observed tissue loss.\n\n【39】For injuries recognized in the late postoperative period， particularly in the presence of biliary peritonitis or sepsis， treatment should be targeted towards getting the systemic infection under control， and the most widely accepted ap-proach is external biliary drainage rather than open sur-gery \\[7\\]. However， the presence of generalized peritonitis in our patient， due to anastomotic leakage， led to undoing of the anastomosis， followed by placement of a T-tube， thus achieving simultaneous internal bile duct continuity and ex-ternal drainage. The subsequent development of fibrous tis-sue overlaying the T-tube helped maintain bile duct conti-nuity even after removal of the T-tube， reduce the need for definitive surgery.\n\n【40】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【41】For injuries with tissue loss requiring external drainage， T-tube bridging offers a feasible option in that it provides\n\n【42】bile duct continuity with biliary flow into the duodenum， as well as achieving external drainage. As in our patient， this method may even eliminate the need for definitive surgery.\n\n【43】REFERENCES：\n\n【44】1\\.

Uncomplicated hydatid cysts， seen as round opaque lesions on chest radiography， are eas-ily diagnosed， whereas complicated cysts (infected and or perforated) may change the radiographic appear-ance of the hydatid cyst， causing an incorrect diagnosis and delayed treatment. Although in radiology many signs have been described， the “air bubble\" sign， seen in the mediastinal window of CECT as a single or mul-tiple small rounded radiolucent areas with sharp margins within the periphery of a solid mass lesion， is being recognized as a sign with high sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of complicated hydatid cysts.\n\n【25】Case Report：\n\n【26】A 32-year-old female on anti-tubercular treatment for the past 3 months without any improvement was ad-mitted to our hospital. CECT of the chest revealed a mass-like lesion with the \"air bubble\" sign. After 15 days the patient had a vigorous bout of coughing， leading to expectoration of pieces of whitish yellowish gelatinous membrane for the next 3 days. The ELISA result for Echinococcus was highly positive. On the basis of the “air bubble” sign， positive serology， and expectorated pieces of the membrane， the patient was diagnosed as hav-ing a complicated hydatid cyst.\n\n【27】Conclusions：\n\n【28】Due to the varied presentations of complicated hydatid cyst， the knowledge and awareness of various signs in radiology associated with the hydatid cyst， in particular the “air bubble\" sign， is imperative in making a prompt and accurate diagnosis of a complicated hydatid cyst.\n\n【29】MeSH Keywords： Echinococcosis， Pulmonary · Helminthiasis· Lung Diseases\n\n【30】Full-text PDF http：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/892621\n\n【31】24\n\n【32】The Echinococcus (E) tapeworm， a common helminth infecting carnivores such as dogs and wolves， is known to cause dis-ease in humans， who act as an intermediate host when peo ple accidently become infected by the eggs of the worm. Four\n\n【33】species are recognized： E. granulosis， E. multilocularis， E. voge-\n\n【34】li， and E olgitharus. Of these， the vast majority of the infes-tations in humans are caused by E. granulosus \\[1\\]. After the liver， the lungs are the second most commonly affected or-gan \\[2\\]. The growth of hydatid cysts is slow and may remain undiagnosed for long periods. Uncomplicated cysts， seen as round opaque lesions on chest radiography， are easily diag-nosed. However， infected and or perforated cysts， known as“complicated” cysts， may change the radiographic appear-ance of the hydatid cyst， causing an incorrect diagnosis and delayed treatment \\[3-5\\]. Imaging modalities and serology es-tablish the diagnosis in most cases. However， diagnosis of a complicated hydatid cyst is very difficult and usually delayed. Over time， certain radiological presentations/signs have been identified that are contributive in confirming the diagnosis of complicated hydatid cyst. An important finding on CECT is the “air bubble” sign. It is reported to be highly sens itive and specific in confirming the diagnosis of a ruptured and infect-ed hydatid cyst \\[6\\].\n\n【35】Case Report\n\n【36】A 32-year-old woman presented to our department with com-plaints of fever and cough with expectoration for the past 4months. The fever was low-grade and intermittent， and the cough was accompanied with expectoration， was moderate in quantity and mucopurulent in character. Three months earli-er， she had been put on anti-tubercular treatment on the ba-sis of her lesions on X-ray (Figure 1)， despite her sputum for AFB (Acid fast bacilli) being negative， in the form of category1 DOTS (directly observed therapy short course) under RNTCP(Revised National Tubercu losis Control Programme) without any improvement. General physical examination showed a mod-erately built and nourished anemic female. She was febrile， alert， with a pulse rate of 92/min， respiratory rate of 22/min， and blood pressure of 110/76 mm Hg.Examination of all oth-er organs were essentially normal. Examination of the respi-ratory system revealed impaired percussion note， decreased vesicular breath sounds， and vocal resonance over the right clavicular and supra scapular region. Her latest x-ray chest(Figure 2) showed no change in the opacity in the right up-per zone as compared to her earlier x-ray. Other than a hemo-globin of 9.5% gm， her hematological and biochemical tests were non-revealing. Her sputum for AFB (acid-fast bacilli) and gram stain were negative. Her sputum， sent for culture for pyogenic organisms and BACTEC for AFB， showed no growth.\n\n【37】Figure 1. Chest X-ray PA view showing a homogeneous opacity in the right upper zone.\n\n【38】Figure 2.

A CT-guided trans-thoracic FNAC (fine-needle aspiration cytology) was attempted and 10 ml of pus was aspirated. Various tests， gram stain， AFB stain， and fun-gal stains were negative. The culture for pyogenic organisms and BACTEC for AFB showed no growth. The patient was put on broad-spectrum antibiotics and treated for non-resolving pneumonia. After 14 days， although the patient showed symp-tomatic improvement， she did not show radiological improve-ment； thus， we planned to do bronchoscopy. On the night prior to the bronchoscopy， she had an episode of vigorous coughing\n\n【42】Figure 5. Coughed-up pieces of the whitish-yellowish membrane of the hydatid cyst.\n\n【43】Figure 6. Chest X-ray shows a ruptured hydatid cyst masked by surrounding pneumonitis and an air-fluid level mimicking lung abscess.\n\n【44】with expectoration of whitish yellowish membranous materi-al (Figure 5)， suggesting a ruptured hydatid cyst in the lung. The patient continued to expectorate pieces of similar mem-branous material for the next 3 days. Histopathology of this membranous tissue confirmed it to be the outer layers of a hy-datid cyst. Her latest x-ray showed a ruptured cyst in the form of a lung abscess obscured by the surrounding pneumonitis(Figure 6). ELISA for Echinococcus， which was advised after the patient expectorated membranous material， turned out to be highly positive - 45.47 U/ml (N <8 U/ml). Searching through the literature， we came across the “air bubble\" sign and its importance in the diagnosis of complicated hydatid cyst， and\n\n【45】Figure 7. Chest CECT showing an “empty cyst” sign.\n\n【46】indeed we were able to appreciate this sign on the patient's CECT (Figure 3). Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed no abnormality of any organ. Further， there was no history of any pet dog. On the basis of clinical， radiological， and serolog-ical findings， she was diagnosed as having a complicated hy-datid cyst. The patient refused surgery and received medical treatment consisting of albendazole 400 mg twice daily for 3weeks， to be repeated after a gap of 15 days for at least 3-4cycles. The patient then showed marked symptomatic and ra-diological improvement. After 1 month， a repeat CECT chest was done， which showed an empty cyst/cavity， also known as the “empty cyst\" sign (Figure 7). She is on regular follow-up and continuing medical treatment.\n\n【47】Discussion\n\n【48】Pulmonary hyd atid disease is a serious problem in many coun-tries，including several Mediterranean countries， New Zealand， Australia，North America， South America，Central America， and Asia \\[7\\]. Infection with the larva of the tapeworm of the genus Echinococcus is responsible for hydatid disease， also known as echinococcosis or hydatidosis. Although， dogs and some wild carnivores are the primary hosts， it spreads in humans， who are the intermediate host， by incidental direct contact with in-fected dogs or their feaces. The disease is characterized by cyst formation in various organs of the body， with the liver being the most common site of infection， followed by the lungs. The hydatid cyst colonizes the right lung more than the left lung and in most instances the cyst is solitary \\[8，9\\]. The simultane-ous involvement of the liver and lung is quite uncommon but when it occurs， the right lung is affected in 97% of the cas-es \\[10\\]. In our case the hydatid cyst was located in the upper lobe of the right lung.\n\n【49】The clinical presentation and the complications associated with pulmonary hydatid cyst depend on whether the cyst is simple or complicated. Most patients with simple pulmonary hydatid\n\n【50】cyst are asymptomatic， but depending on the size and its lo-cation in the lung， it can produce some nonspecific symptoms such as cough， chest pain， and hemoptysis \\[11\\]. A complicat-ed hydatid cyst is a cyst that has ruptured into the bronchus or pleural cavity， with or without infection \\[12\\]. The patients with complicated cyst， other than cough， dyspnea and chest pain present with symptoms such as expectoration of cystic contents (salty sputum and grape skin-like membrane)， persis-tent hemoptysis， productive sputum， and fever \\[12\\].\n\n【51】Routine hematological and biochemical tests are unsupport-ive in the diagnosis of hydatid disease. Casoni test， Weinberg complement fixation test， and total eosinophils counts cannot be relied upon \\[1\\]. Serology and imaging modalities in combi-nation secure the diagnosis in most cases. With a sensitivity of 85.3%，immunoglobulin G enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA) test is the most sensitive serological test in de-tecting pulmonary hydatid disease \\[13\\].\n\n【52】Among the various imaging modalities， x-ray of the chest is the initial investigation of choice. Unruptured pulmonary hyda-tid cyst usually shows as a homogenous round or oval-shaped mass with smooth borders surrounded by normal lung tissue on chest radiograph； many times it can be an incidental find-ing， with the x-ray ordered for some other ailment \\[14\\]. As a consequence of cyst rupture， the complicated hydatid cyst may simulate a lung abscess， malignant tumor， tuberculosis， and other infected cystic lesions of the lung \\[5，6\\]， which complicate the clinical picture further， as also seen in our case. Among the different radiological signs of ruptured hydatid cyst， “crescent”or“meniscus”sign， “double arch” or“Cumbo’s\"sign，“water lily\" sign or sign of “camelotte\"，“daughter cyst\"or “rising sun”sign，“serpent”sign，“Monod’s\" sign， and “air bubble\" sign are important signs \\[15\\].\n\n【53】Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT)， is an impor-tant imaging modality， especially in evaluation of the compli-cated hydatid cyst. Of the various signs associated with hyda-tid cyst， the “air bubble”sign is reported to be very sensitive and specific (85.7% sensitivity and 96.6% specificity) in es-tablishing the diagnosis of complicated hydatid cyst \\[16\\]. It is best seen in the mediastinal window as single or multiple small， rounded radiolucent areas with sharp margins with-in the periphery of a solid mass lesion. Dissection of air be-tween the pericyst and parasitic membrane due to erosion of a bronchiole by an expanding cyst is thought to be responsi-ble for this sign \\[17\\]. Compared to classical CT signs， the“air bubble\" sign is more accurate in the correct diagnosis of rup-tured， infected， solid hydatid cysts \\[16\\]. The presence of this sign in our case， along with a positive serology， helped us in making the correct diagnosis. Moreover， attenuation values in infected cysts are considerably higher (above 20 HU) than in unruptured cysts. This solid density of the infected hydatid\n\n【54】cyst makes it very difficult to differentiate from an abscess or neoplasm \\[18\\]. Solid appearance on CT scan prevents the cor-rect differentiation between hydatid disease and malignant tumor. Pursuit of correct diagnosis leads to further invasive diagnostic investigations such as bronchoscopy， transthorac-ic needle aspiration， and abdominal and cranial CECT\\[6\\]. The mass-like appearance with a high attenuation value (24HU) on CECT and our lack of awareness/knowledge regarding the“air bubble\" sign led us to undertake certain avoidable inves-tigations and delayed the diagnosis. In a few cases， follow-up CECT scan obtained 2-3 months later shows an empty cyst after complete expectoration of the contents， known as the“empty cyst\" sign \\[19\\]. This sign was also appreciated in our case in the follow-up CECT obtained 1 month later.\n\n【55】Bronchoscopy is not the preferred investigation in patients with pulmonary hydatid cyst who present with a typical clin-ical picture and radiological appearance. However， it may be performed when a tumor is suspected or when the radiological picture is atypical \\[20\\]， as in our case. Specific and non-specific bronchoscopic findings for pulmonary hydatid cysts have been described in adults， a whitish-yellow gelatinous membrane be-ing the solitary specific finding \\[21\\]. We had also planned to do bronchoscopy， but decided against it once the patient ex-pectorated whitish-yellowish membranous material， a com-mon finding in the ruptured hydatid disease.\n\n【56】References：\n\n【57】1\\.

It is a benign condition of unknown aetiology that usually affects young Asian men.12 We report a case of a 19-year-old woman with a neck lump for the past 3 months said to be enlarged. A less characteristic manifestation with a rare prevalence， Kimura disease， can be considered a differential diagnosis in a colli tumour. In this case， it was established after a histopathological biopsy. Treatment for Kimura disease is still under observation in several studies. The treatments that have been tested include surgery radiotherapy， and administration of corticosteroids and immunosuppressants or a combination. In this case， surgical therapy was initiated， followed by steroids and radiotherapy.\n\n【5】KEYWORDS Kimura disease， neck mass， lymphadenopathy radiotherapy\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Kimura disease (KD) was first described in 1937 by Kimm and Szeto in China as \"eosinophilic hyperplastic lymphogranuloma\". In 1948， Kimura detailed the pathological features of this dis-ease， and this condition has been widely referred to as Kimura's disease. Most cases are reported in Asia， particularly in China， Japan， and Southeast Asia， and are usually seen in young men. In a study by Zhang et al. in 2020 in China in 24 cases of KD male to female ratio was 5：1， and the ratio of unilateral to bilateral lesions was 4：1. KD lumps or lesions are often painless， but some complaints of pruritus to melanin pigmentation of the overlying skin. These may be due to nerve infiltration by lymphocytes and eosinophils. In a study in China， 33.3% of patients had pruritus，20.8% had melanin pigmentation， and 12.5% had a roughness of the affected overlying skin. Lesions are usually common in the head and neck， parotid， and cervical lymphadenopathy. Less common sites may manifest in the epiglottis， larynx， median nerve， and chest wall.1，3\n\n【8】Copyright @ 2023 by the Bulgarian Association of Young Surgeons\n\n【9】DO： 10.5455/JMRCR.172-1660141476First Received： August 19，2022Accepted： Novemnber 8， 2022Associate Editor： Ivan Inkov (BG)；'Corresponding author： Firda Widasari (firda.widasari@yahoo.com)\n\n【10】Case Report\n\n【11】A 19-year-old woman came with the main complaint of a lump on the right neck for the past 3 months before being admitted to the hospital. Initially， the lump was the size of a quail egg then enlarged like a chicken egg in 3 months. The lump feels soft and is not painful. She denied complaints of fever， painful swallowing， sore throat， hoarse voice， and shortness of breath. The patient initially went to an oncology surgeon， and a fine nee-dle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) was performed， the results were chronic suppurative inflammation， and antibiotic therapy did not improve. Then a biopsy and lymphadenectomy were per-formed. After 3 weeks of follow-up， the Colli mass reappeared and grew bigger. The patient was given prednisone and then referred to the division of tropical infection of internal medicine.\n\n【12】The initial results of the post-lymphadenectomy physical ex-amination revealed an irregular soft lump with a diameter of 7cm， as shown in Figure 1； non-tender， ill-defined borders and good postoperative scars were found. In addition， the ultra-sound guiding Colli during FNAB showed a mass impression(figure 2). A soft tissue mass in the right colli region penetrated the thoracic inlet and deviated the trachea to the left without constricting the airway on the cervical x-ray in the AP and lateral positions (figure 3).\n\n【13】Figure 1 Colli mass before lymphadenectomy.\n\n【14】Figure 2 Ultrasound of the neck before therapy.\n\n【15】Figure 3 Cervical X-ray before therapy\n\n【16】The biopsy results in Figures 4 and 5 show lymph node tissue with inflammatory cells consisting of lymphocytes and eosinophils， and Langhans giant cells were obtained； no signs of malignancy were found. The immunohistochemical test showed that CD1a was stained negatively in all cells， CD68 was stained negatively in all cells， and Ki-67 was stained positively in nuclei±40% of reactive lymphoid cells. The immunohistochemical pro-file of the Colli dextra tumour showed a non-neoplastic lesion， reactive lymphadenitis appropriate for Kimura disease.\n\n【17】The patient was given steroid therapy with methylpred-nisolone for 4 weeks in divided doses， starting at 24 mg and then tapering off. Observations in 3 visits said the lump had\n\n【18】shrunk but grew again (figure 6). The patient finally decided to undergo radiotherapy 18 times. During the radiotherapy period， she complained of hoarseness after the 14th radiotherapy， was given a low dose of steroid and then improved. Follow-up after completion of radiotherapy， the lump had complete resolution(figure 7). There was no lump on the neck in the last follow-up， October 2021.\n\n【19】Figure 4 Left： Lymph node tissue with inflammatory cells consisting of lymphocytes and eosinophils.

Right： Immunohistochemistry： Ki-67： Positive staining on nuclei ± 40% reactive lymphoid cells.\n\n【21】Figure 6 Patient after steroid therapy.\n\n【22】Figure 7 Clinical patient after radiotherapy， total resolution of the colli mass.\n\n【23】A lump or tumour on the neck clinically has various differential diagnoses. Kimura disease (KD) is a rare case usually found on biopsy. In patients with a clinical lump in the neck， it can be thought of as a malignant tumour， such as lymphoma， sarcoma， thyroid malignancy， or benign， such as lipoma， hemangioma， fibroma， and neuroma neck. Other clinically similar diagnoses， including infection and inflammation such as sialadenitis， cervi-cal adenitis， and a rare incidence of autoimmune classification， are suspected as Castleman's disease or Kimura disease.+\n\n【24】The pathophysiology of KD is still unclear， thought to be mediated by increased production of IgE and cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha，interleukin (IL)-4， IL-5， and IL-13. One study observed overexpression of IL-21 and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK1/2) in 18 patients with KD. This patient denied a history of the previous infection， the appearance of a lump in the neck， and a history of other autoimmune diseases.25\n\n【25】KD's most common pathological findings are nodal forma-tion with extensive reactive lymphoid infiltrate， proliferation of postcapillary venules， and infiltration with eosinophils， mast cells， histiocytes， and Langerhans cells. Other less common features include sclerosis， polykaryocytes，germinal centre vas-culature， protein deposits， germinal centre necrosis， eosinophilic abscess， and reticular IgE deposition. In this case， we found in-flammatory cells consisting of lymphocytes and eosinophils and Langerhans cells. Serum test results did not show the presence of eosinophilia.26\n\n【26】Histopathologically similar differential diagnosis is angiolym-phoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia (ALHE). ALHE occurs primarily in the dermis as a subcutaneous lesion instead of Kimura’s disease. Both are characterized by severe eosinophilic infiltration， vascular proliferation， and predilection in the head and neck region. Although ALHE and KD share some simi-larities， they are distinguished by the absence of fibrosis and pathological angiomatoid proliferation； peripheral eosinophil and IgE concentrations are usually not clinically elevated.26\n\n【27】The biopsy results， in this case， showed that the inflamma-tory cells consisted of many lymphocytes and eosinophils， and Langhans giant cells were obtained. The finding of Langerhans cells was differentially diagnosed as possible Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). LCH is a clonal expansion of the myeloid precursor， characterized by CD1a or CD207 positive. LCH can manifest clinically in the form of a lump in the neck， but this disease involves systemic to manifest in other organs such as the lungs， spleen， liver， and bones.\n\n【28】Immunohistochemistry showed CD1a was stained negative in all cells， CD68 was stained negative in all cells， and the CD68marker could show positive results in cases of LCH and ALHE but negative in Kimura disease. Ki-67 stained positively on nuclei ± 40% reactive lymphoid cells. The immunohistochemi-cal profile of the Colli dextra tumour showed a non-neoplastic lesion， reactive lymphadenitis appropriate for Kimura disease. Deng et al. in 2014 involved 40 patients with kimura disease with the Ki-67 marker as the disease prognosis. The pathological features of KD show an increase in T cells and resemble lvm-phoma. Deng et al. suspect that these markers can generally predict the prognosis of KD. The results showed that patients with the largest mass size of 3.5 cm， peripheral eosinophilia 35%， and with a proliferation index of Ki-67 as much as 3% tend to be prone to recurrence.8，9\n\n【29】KD treatment remains controversial due to the lack of large-\n\n【30】scale systemic clinical studiesS..SSome treatments that have been reported to be successful are surgery， radiotherapy， and chemotherapy. According to several case reports， drugs such as cyclosporine， tacrolimus， mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)， and loratadine also provide responses ranging from mild improve-ment to complete remission. Chen et al.， in 2016， conducted a study of administering MMF in 29 patients with KD with renal involvement. Giving MMF 250 mg twice a day gave the results of complete remission in 22 patients， 10 patients relapsed， and partial remission in 4 patients.\n\n【31】Kimura disease is benign， so surgical resection does not spread the lesion but helps reduce the lump and is useful for diagnosis. Therefore， surgical excision has been considered the gold standard for treating KD. However， KD usually involves the subcutaneous tissue without clear boundaries， so it is chal-lenging to achieve negative margins by surgical excision alone， and recurrence is possible. According to Zhang et al.， up to 46.2%of recurrences were associated with the surgical group in a study. Combining surgery with postoperative intervention seems to be a reasonable approach for treating KD.Nakahara et al. reported that steroid therapy could control lesions， lymphadenopathy， and nephrotic syndrome in KD， but local recurrence is common during steroid dose reduction. In this patient， surgical excision was performed， but the lump reappeared. The administration of steroids for 4 weeks was considered ineffective because it had shrunk a little but grew again. In the end， the patient was decided for radiotherapy.310\n\n【32】Radiotherapy has been used to treat recurrent or persistent lesions with better local control rates. However， the carcinogenic effects of radiotherapy and the benign nature of the disease limit its use as a primary modality. The study of Ye et al. stated that surgical resection combined with low-dose postoperative radio therapy for KD treatment achieved the lowest local recurrence rate. In this study， the recurrence rate after surgical excision combined with low-dose radiotherapy was lower than with surgical excision alone or surgical resection followed by oral corticosteroids.11\n\n【33】Conclusion\n\n【34】Kimura disease has a rare incidence. Patients with a lump in the neck have a very broad differential diagnosis. In this case， a young woman with a lump in the neck can be considered a kimura disease. In this patient， there is no known risk factor for the emergence of Kimura disease. Radiotherapy showed a good response in this patient， whereas the administration of steroids and surgery previously showed a poor response.\n\n【35】Funding\n\n【36】This work did not receive any grant from funding agencies in the public， commercial， or not-for-profit sectors.\n\n【37】Conflict of interest\n\n【38】There are no conflicts of interest to declare by any of the authors of this study.\n\n【39】References\n\n【40】1\\.

Symptoms include a disproportionately greater motor deficit of upper limbs than lower limbs with varying degrees of sensory loss below the lesion's level and sacral sparing with or without bladder in-volvement.1，34\\]\n\n【16】These are results from central cord type lesions due to contu-sion， haemorrhage， or oedema.\\[1\\] TCCS is often associated with hyperextension injury of the cervical spine and might occur after minor trauma without bony injury in patients with preexisting pathology of cervical spondylosis (CS) or canal stenosis.\\[3-5\\]\n\n【17】Ishida and Tominaga， in a review of central cord injuries， noted that motor vehicle collisions， falls， and diving injuries were the most common aetiology of this incomplete spinal cord injury.\\[3\\] Schneider et al. proposed the aetiology of the spinal cord injury was due to damage to the central spinal cord neuronal tracts resulting from a sudden compression of the cord between the hy-pertrophic spondylotic disc osteophyte complex and the buckled posterior ligament flavum.\\[1-7\\]\n\n【18】Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is a common cervical disease characterized by bony occupation in uPaT the narrowed canal and a cord’s chronic compression. Usually， there are no symptoms regarding this condition. However， when a minor force occurs， the cord will be easily compressed.\\[8\\]\n\n【19】Brodkey et al.， and Bose et al.， reported rapid and more complete neurological improvement after surgery for patients with spinal cord compression or spinal instability on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or dynamic cervical lateral radio-graphs.\\[2，9\\] A retrospective study of 114 patients with acute or chronic TCCS reported that better results were achieved in early surgical decompressions of clinically correlated encroach-ing cord lesions.\\[1，3\\]\n\n【20】Koyanagi stated that patients who underwent posterior de-compre sSsSilon displayed improvement in Frankel grade. When the cord is compressed mainly from ventral ossification， an an-terior approach seems to be an appropriate way to achieve im-mediate decompression.\\[8\\] Belanger thought that anterior de-compression and arthrodesis was effective in pain relief and neurological improvement but increased the risks of postop-erative graft dislodgement， nonunion， and neurological symp-toms.\\[6\\] Posterior laminoplasty procedure can enlarge the canal space and shifts the cord backwards to alleviate compression， although the ossification cannot be removed directly. In the current study， laminoplasty was performed for ASCI patients， and fewer complications than for conservative treatment were observed. \\[8\\]\n\n【21】The treatment for OPLL is controversial. Some experts recom-mend conservative treatment because the incomplete SCI might heal within months or even years， and surgical treatment was not superior to conservative treatment for patients without bone and disc injury suffering from cord compression in the acute phase.2，5，8 However， some victims continue to suffer from a persistent neurologic deficit of the upper limbs， with poor daily activity， for months or even years. Currently， more and more pa-tients demand a high-quality life.8 Many authors believed that surgical treatment for ASCI with OPLL improved neurological outcome clinically compared to conservative treatment. Thus it is still a dilemma upon choosing a surgical approach.\\[2，5，8\\]\n\n【22】This study reported the management of 55 years old man with spinal cord injury central cord syndrome type with dispro-portionate paresis， congenital cervical canal stenosis， ossifica-tions of the posterior longitudinal ligament. It closed commin-uted fracture of left clavicle underwent decompression surgery by laminoplasty on C3-C6 and open reduction with plate screw fixation on the left clavicle.\n\n【23】Case report\n\n【24】A male， 55 years old patient came to our hospital with a chief complaint of weakness in his upper and lower limbs three weeks prior to admission. This condition appeared after the patient had a motorcycle accident， he was thrown away from his motor-cycle and hit the ground on his neck， and he rolled over on the ground. There was no history of the unconscious， no vomiting，\n\n【25】and no convulsion. At that time， he was unable to move his both arms and legs. He had no complaint about defecation and urination. Because of his complaint， he decided to go to Urip Sumoharjo Hospital for seven days and then he was referred to Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital.\n\n【26】On physical examination， there was no abnormality in gen-eral states， but on the neck region， there was tenderness by pal-pation； according to VAS， it was 2-3 out of 10. On neurological examination， there were weakness and loss of sensation on both his upper limbs， C5 until T1 segment， and lower limbs， L2 until S1 segment. His upper limbs felt weaker than his lower limbs on the motoric examination， but the sensory was the same. On physiological reflexes， there was hyperreflexes on the patellar tendon reflex on both limbs. There were pathological reflexes， such as the Babinsky group and clonus， on his both limbs. There was bruised on the left shoulder region， and he felt tenderness； according to VAS， it was 2-3 out of 10. There was a limitation on moving his left shoulder due to pain.\n\n【27】Laboratory finding showed hemoglobin level of 13，8 g/dL， hematocrit 41，8% vol， white blood cell 9.700/mm3，platelets 318x 103/mm3， prothrombin time 11，.4 seconds， activated partial thromboplastin time 31，9 seconds， AST 46 U/L， ALT 60U/L， Ureum level 110，7 mg/dL， Creatinin level 1，46 mg/dL， blood glucose 137 mg/dL， and electrolyte (Na/K/Cl) 142/4，1/107mg/dL. On x-ray， the cervical showed radioopaque behind the corpus vertebrae， and an x-ray of his left shoulder showed a frac-ture site of the left clavicle. Cervical CT scan showed ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament dorsal from corpus vertebrae lying from C3 until C6 segment. Cervical MRI T1-weighted image showed canal stenosis under 1，8 cm.\n\n【28】The patient was diagnosed with spinal cord injury， central cord syndrome type with tetraparesis， congenital cervical canal stenosis， ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament， and closed comminuted fracture of the left clavicle. He was planned to have surgery. The surgical procedures that have been per-formed were： decompression by laminoplasty on level C3 until C6 for the spine and open reduction internal fixation for the left clavicle.\n\n【29】For the spine operation， the patient was placed in a prone position under general anaesthesia. The incision was performed from C2 until the C6 segment， layer by layer. We identified C2until C6 processus spinosus. We did open door decompression by laminoplasty with the hinge on the right side， from C2-C6until flavum ligament showed and then we excised it. After the dura mater showed， we put 4 levels of 6 holes miniplate on the lamina of C3 until C6， each contained 4 screws on the ipsilateral side. We put spongostan on the open door decompression and a bone graft on the hinge side. For the clavicle operation， the pa-tient was placed in a supine position under general anaesthesia. The incision was performed along the left clavicle. There was found 4 fragments， and then we reduced them with a plate and screw. We put a bone graft between the fracture gap.\n\n【30】One week after the operation， he improved his motor and sensory on his upper and lower limbs.\n\n【31】Discussion\n\n【32】Current controversies regarding the management of cervical spine injuries with congenital canal stenosis and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament. Several authors believed no significant differences in clinical neurologic improvement in conservative methods compared to the surgical method.\\[8， 10\\]\n\n【33】The patient was referred to our Orthopaedic Polyclinic at\n\n【34】Figure 1： Clinical picture showing neck of the patient.\n\n【35】Figure 5： CT-scan image of the cervical， ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament.\n\n【36】Figure 2： Clinical picture showing left shoulder of the patient.\n\n【37】Figure 6： MRI image of the cervical with cervical canal stenosis.\n\n【38】Figure 3： X-ray image of the cervical radioopaque behind corpus vertebrae.\n\n【39】Figure 7： The incision from C2 until C6 segment and the exposed C2-C6 processus spinosus.\n\n【40】Figure 4： X-ray image of the left shoulder， fracture of left clavicle.\n\n【41】Figure 8： Open door decompression by laminoplasty with the hinge on the right side.\n\n【42】Figure 9： Plate fixation with 4 levels of 6 holes miniplate on the lamina of C3 until C6， each contained 4 screws on the ipsilateral side.\n\n【43】Figure 10： X-ray post-operation on the cervical lateral\n\n【44】Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital due to increased weakness on upper and lower limbs 3 weeks prior due to a fall from a bicycle ride. Prior to admission， the patient was hospitalized in another hospital for 7 weeks and received conservative treatment. With no history of unconsciousness， no vomit and no convulsion， the patient also did not have any complaint of defecation and urination. There was also a comminuted fracture of the left clavicle.\n\n【45】Plain radiograph of the clavicle and anteroposterior with lat-eral cervical projection， computed tomography (CT) scan of the cervical vertebrae and T1-weighted image of the cervico-thoracal vertebrae were obtained. From the CT scan image， ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament was observed. There was cer-vical spinal cord compression on C3-C4 with congenital cervical canal stenosis observed on the T1-weighted image MRI shown by a more than 3：1 ratio for the body： spinal canal. Comminuted fracture of the left clavicle from the plain radiograph. There were no signs of bony fracture or dislocation on the cervical vertebrae. Laboratory examination did not show any associative abnormalities.\n\n【46】The patient was diagnosed with cervical spine compression\n\n【47】with central cord syndrome characteristic with disproportionate paralysis worsened on the upper limbs with sacral sparing.\\[1\\] Cervical spinal injury with central cord syndrome in this patient occurred after a minor trauma that happened three weeks before due to a motorcycle fall. This mechanism commonly happen in elderly people with canal stenosis and OPLL.\\[1-3\\]\n\n【48】Many individuals with OPLL usually have no symptoms in their daily lives and are unaware of the pathologic structure on the ventral side of the spinal cord.\\[11\\] Elderly patients in Japan tend to have cervical spinal canal stenosis secondary to cervical spondylosis with developmental stenosis and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL).\\[10\\] Ossification existing in a narrowed canal is a time bomb.\\[12\\] When a minor force occurs， the cord does not have enough space to escape and is easily crowded by the ossification hence creating a spinal cord compression.\\[8\\]\n\n【49】Although there is no consensus on treatment with this clinical scenario， some suggest conservative management while others feel surgery is indicated. There is still a question about whether decompression surgery improves neurological status in patients with cervical spinal cord injury without bone and disc injury. Kawano et al. reported that surgical treatment was not superior to conservative treatment. In contrast， some authors reported improved neurological status after decompression for these pa-tients.\\[10\\] Schneider et al. reported that conservative therapy should have been first used in patients with acute central cervi-cal spinal cord injury syndrome.\\[7，10J Chen et al. reported that surgical decompression might have been associated with rapid neurologic improvement， early mobilization， and briefer periods of hospitalization and rehabilitation compared with non-surgical treatment.10，13\\]\n\n【50】Song et al. reported in a series of 22 patients with subaxial acute traumatic CCS without fracture or dislocation， with MRI showing cord compression in all cases， cervical instability in11 cases， disc herniation in seven cases， cervical spondylosis in11 cases and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament(OPLL) in four cases， and surgery interval ranging from 1 to 37days (mean 8.0)， surgical management improved the neurologi-cal status and prevented delayed neurological deterioration.\\[2\\]\n\n【51】We did decompression of the C3-C6 with laminoplasty using the Hirabayashi technique. Surgery was done in the fashion of posterior approach exposing posterior element then open-door laminoplasty was performed. Laminae were dissected on the left side， and hinges were made on the right side. A neck collar was not used postoperatively， and a corticosteroid was not given. One week post-operation， the patient felt improvement in upper and lower motor function with increased sensitivity.\n\n【52】Improvement on clinical results in surgical outcomes of SCI with OPLL. After laminoplasty， the canal was enlarged， and the cord was decompressed with more space to breathe. Lamino-plasty is a benefit for decompression of injured cord and main-taining cervical stability. Besides alleviating the cord and inner pressure， it improves the blood supply and microcirculation and avoids or reduces secondary injury to the cord achieved indirectly.\n\n【53】Conclusion\n\n【54】In a fifty-five-year-old patient with sub-acute cervical cord injury with congenital canal stenosis and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL)， we did open door decompression by posterior laminoplasty to relieve the central cord compression syndrome.\n\n【55】One week post-operation， the patient felt improvement in upper and lower limbs muscle power. Hence， we recommend doing surgery on patients with cervical cord injury with OPLL and congenital spinal stenosis.\n\n【56】Author contribution\n\n【57】Dohar A. L.

However， ongoing CSF leakage is the most common issue for some patients， and contributing to reoperation for repairing is reported. At this point is valuable to identify prognostic factors that influence the CSF leaks rates to make multi-faceted decisions； being as challenging as the technical procedures for neurosurgeons and their team. Objective： The aim of this review is to determine whether preoperative factors are associated with postoperative CSF leaks in extended endoscopic endonasal surgery for pituitary adenoma. Data Sources： A systematic review of published articles undergoing extended endoscopic endonasal surgery for pituitary adenomas between 2000and 2019 was performed.

Their prevalence is estimated to be about 25 cases per100，000 inhabitants in cancer registries， accounting for 10-15%of all brain tumors \\[9， 10\\]. The significant potential advantage of the endoscopic endonasal technique is to provide a direct anatomical route to the lesion since it does not traverse any ma-jor neurovascular structures， thereby obviating brain retraction.\\[5\\] Following extended endoscopic transsphenoidal approaches\n\n【6】Copyright @ 2020 by the Bulgarian Association of Young Surgeons\n\n【7】DOI：10.5455/IJMRCR.PituitaryAdenomasEndoscopicEndonasalSurgery\n\n【8】First Received： November 06.2019Accepted： February 04， 2020\n\n【9】Manuscript Associate Editor： Ivan Inkov (BG)\n\n【10】1Diana Maria Cespedes Arcani， Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University\n\n【11】http：//orcid.org/0000-0003-1979-9214； phone：+8615549450300\n\n【12】(EEAs) has allowed resection of cranial-base lesions beyond the sella. One major criticism is an increased risk of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage because of the more signifi-cant skull base defect \\[3， 10， 19J. Surgical decision-making has evolved， and what was once an intuitive matter for surgeons has now become a multi-faceted decision with increased expecta-tions from medical staff and patients， so is valuable to predict fac-tors that can reduce the length stay surgery or planning the most affordable treatment for comorbidities； in order to diminish CSF leak as a common complication of it which can be higher than the primary disease being as challenging as the technical proce-dures for neurosurgeons and their team. These risks，however， are not well established in pituitary surgery. Indeed， several systematic reviews show results of in terms of standard tech-nique resection vs microsurgical surgery complications， most of them as a gross general report with lack of information about the extended approaches. For that reason， the aimed of this systematic review is to determine the risk factor of CSF leaks rate as a complication of extended approaches in endoscopic\n\n【13】Objectives\n\n【14】The aim of this review is to determine whether preoperative factors are associated with postoperative CSF leaks in adult pa-tients with pituitary adenoma underwent extended endoscopic endonasal surgery.\n\n【15】Review Question\n\n【16】Which are the preoperative factors that could predict postoper-ative CSF leaks after extended endoscopic surgery in patients with pituitary adenoma?\n\n【17】Will the type of extended approach have in common the same preoperative factors for CSF leaks rates between them， during endoscopic surgery for patients with pituitary adenoma?\n\n【18】Protocol and Registration\n\n【19】Inclusion Criteria\n\n【20】Studies were identified by searching electronic databases：\n\n【21】1\\. published studies reporting on outcomes of EEEA for pitu-itary adenomas；\n\n【22】2\\. no limited language restriction；\n\n【23】3\\. references list on a case report and review articles of ex-tended endoscopic endonasal surgery for pituitary ade-noma were also searched；\n\n【24】4\\. containing original data；\n\n【25】5\\. adult patients (> 18 years).\n\n【26】6\\.

We only included publications over the last 30 decades， being the boom of extended approaches started around it.\n\n【28】The outcomes of interest of this review will be factors asso-ciated with CSF leak rate in expanded approaches for pituitary endoscopic endonasal surgery. CSF leaks as a complication for extended endonasal surgery had to occur within this surgical procedure or after. In this context， factors are defined as any attribute， characteristic or exposure of any individual that in-creases the CSF leak rate due to extensive endoscopic endonasal surgery for pituitary adenomas. Besides， demographics charac-teristics of participants (age， sex，)， pathology and type of inter vention (the type of approach， the learning curve of surgeons(whether is available))\n\n【29】Exclusion Criteria\n\n【30】i) Studies which are letters， commentaries， reviews reports where do not include a quantitative analysis of factors asso-ciated with CSF leak rate in patients with pituitary adenoma underwent extended endoscopic endonasal surgery；\n\n【31】ii) microscopic or combined microscopic and endoscopic ap-proach without a separate description of endoscopic results；\n\n【32】iii) Articles including more than 10% other pathologies than pituitary adenomas\n\n【33】iv) cranipharyngioma and Rathke cyst which not arise from the gland (because of this a study main on the pathology and surgery technique， not tumors location and surgery technique)\\[26\\]；\n\n【34】v) We excluded publication combined endoscopic assisted mi-crosurgery.\n\n【35】Search methods for identification of studies\n\n【36】We will perform an accurate， comprehensive search strategy with relevant search terms for studies published between2000 and 2019. Databases from： MEDLINE through PubMed， CINAHL， and Cochrane were the bases platforms for our re-search. For grey literature， we will search LILACS，OpenGrey， and Google Scholar. For each key concept， appropriate free-text words and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) will be devel-oped. To ensure the appropriate electronic databases， certain text words will be truncated， while wildcards will be used for some. This will enable the retrieval of relevant articles that might have used different spellings for the same word. The free-text words (truncated or wildcards) and MeSH terms will be combined using Boolean logic operators： AND， OR and NOT， appropriately.Terms included were “extended endo-scopic endonasal surgery\"AND \"complications\"；“pituitary adenoma\" AND\" extended endoscopic surgery\" OR endoscopic approaches；“risk factors\" AND\" CSF leaks\" AND“extended endoscopic endonasal surgery\".\n\n【37】Data extraction Data collection and management\n\n【38】Data will be extracted on the following： author's first name， publication date， study design (cross-sectional， case-control， prospective and retrospective cohort， and interventional stud-ies)， study interval， sample size， number of procedures for only pituitary adenoma， tumor type， approach technique， CSF leaks rate， duration of follow-up， the preoperative factors were cat-egorized by groups： demographics， pathology (size and type of tumor)， surgical factors (previous treatment，radiotherapy， knosp grade). Data will be extracted on Microsoft Excel 2010developed according to the sequence of variables required from the primary studies. Any disagreements will be resolved by discussion and consensus between the authors.\n\n【39】Selection of studies\n\n【40】Studies will be reviewed based on the exclusion and inclusion criteria， by us independently (CD and CC) in two stages. During the first stage of title and abstract screening； if both authors reject/include， it will be excluded or included from the review. In the next stage of full text screening； full texts of abstracts selected in the previous stage will be screened for eligibility. In both stages the same inclusion and exclusion criteria were used. Only those studies approved by both authors will be included in the review. A PRISMA chart will be created， to outline and summarize this study selection process \\[5\\]. Since a variety of risk factors can be investigated within the same cohort， a decision was made not to omit overlapping cohorts. All citations identified by our search strategy will be exported to EndNote， bibliographic management software and duplicates removed.\n\n| Population  | Patients with Pituitary Adenoma (Functioning and Non-functioning)  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Interyention  | Patients underwent extended endoscopic endonasal surgery， extendedapproaches (transplannum-transtuberculum； to cavernous sinus； clivus，parasellar，)  |\n| Comparator  | Not applicable  |\n| Outcome  | Postoperative CSF leaks rates： Outcomes according to demographics variables Outcomes according to surgery implications Outcomes according to pathology  |\n| Time  | Predictive factors should be able to be identified preoperatively  |\n\n【42】Assessment of risk of bias in included studies\n\n【43】Risk of bias assessment will be done at the study level. Two authors will independently assess the risk of bias at both the study and outcome level in included studies. Disagreements between the review authors over the risk of bias in particular studies will be resolved by discussion， with involvement of a third author where necessary. The outcome of this appraisal will be discussed in the final narrative synopsis， where its implica-tions on the outcomes will be discussed. Sensitivity analyses of observational studies (prospective and retrospective) will be assessed to explore the impact of the categorization of risk of bias by using the Quality in Prognostic Studies (QUIPS) tool.\n\n【44】Data analysis\n\n【45】Data synthesis\n\n【46】We will report our findings in a narrative synthesis \\[24\\] alongside using a framework which consists：\n\n【47】1\\.

Intracranial high-grade stenosis originated from brain has been regard-ed as an unusual cause of cSAH， especially in young adults.\n\n【18】Case Report：\n\n【19】A case of 33-year-old male presented with mild headache and spontaneous left-sided body weakness. Initial brain computed tomography (CT) showed cSAH in the right superior frontal sulcus. Further neuroimaging ex-aminations including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)， digital subtraction angiography (DSA)， transesopha-geal echocardiogram (TEE)； in addition， lumbar puncture and blood tests were performed. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWl) showed an acute infarction in the right frontal lobe and corona radiata of the territory of mid-dle cerebral artery (MCA). The MR angiography (MRA) displayed no flow signal in the right middle cerebral ar-tery M1-segment， while the DSA displayed bloodstream slowness in the right MCA M1-segment which sug-gested high-grade stenosis of the right MCA. The abnormal laboratory data suggested hyperhomocysteinemia， and excluded causes of thrombosis， infection， or cancer. The mechanism of cSAH may come about in severe atherosclerotic stenosis of MCAs by the broken of expanded tenuous compensatory pial vessels. The patient had good recovered at follow-up.\n\n【20】Conclusions：\n\n【21】This case demonstrates cSAH with acute ischemic stroke， which is an uncommon complication， in a young adult stroke patient； a high-grade atherosclerotic stenosis of the MCA was identified as the etiology\n\n【22】MeSH Keywords：\n\n【23】Cerebrovascular Disorders· Hyperhomocysteinemia· Neuroimaging·Stroke· Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ·Young Adult\n\n【24】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/920606\n\n【25】口22369 盟- 山02 43\n\n【26】Cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage (cSAH) is an infrequent and critical subtype of non-aneurysmal SAH， with different causes， in which bleeding is found in one or a small number of brain cortex sulcus and does not spread into the basal cisterns， ventricles， sylvian fissure or interhemispheric fissure， and so on \\[1\\]. Because the etiologies of cSAH vary and the symptoms are atypical and diverse， it is easy to escape diagnosis， be mis-diagnosed， or to treat mistakenly in the clinical course \\[2-4\\]. Diverse etiologies of spontaneous acute cSAH have been de-scribed， including the following： pial arteriovenous malforma-tions， dural arteriovenous fistulas， arterial dissection， dural or cortical cerebral venous thrombosis， vasculitides， reversible ce-rebral vasoconstriction syndrome， posterior reversible enceph-alopathy syndrome， high-grade stenosis (such as severe ath-erosclerotic carotid disease)， endocarditis， cerebral amyloid angiopathy， coagulation disorders， abscess， cavernomas， and primary and secondary brain tumors \\[5\\].\n\n【27】cSAH secondary to a high-grade internal carotid artery steno-sis is a high-risk marker for cerebral ischemic stroke \\[6，7\\]， but the exact mechanism is not clear. Etiology of ischemic stroke in young adults includes large artery atherosclerosis， cardio-embolism， cerebral small vessel disease， other determined stroke etiologies (antiphospholipid syndrome， autoimmune diseases， cervical artery dissection (CeAD)， Fabry disease，fac-tor II/V diseases， protein C/S diseases， illicit drug use，intracra-nial dissection， malignancy， mitochondrial disorders， moyamoya disease， post-radiation， reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome， vasculitis)， and stroke of undetermined cause (cryp-togenic stroke) \\[8\\]. We should be able to find the exact etiol-ogy of ischemic stroke in young adults.\n\n【28】Here， we report on the case of a 33-year-old young man with high-grade stenosis of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) presenting with cSAH and acute ischemic stroke.\n\n【29】Case Report\n\n【30】Chief complaints\n\n【31】A 33-year-old male patient was admitted to our department on an emergency basis because of a sudden-onset left-sided body weakness with a mild headache for 12 hours.\n\n【32】History of present illness\n\n【33】The patient had a right temporoparietal headache for 12 hours at rest and had no nausea and vomiting. At the same time， he felt left-sided body weakness， but he could lift his arm and walk alone， without slurred speech， numbness， conscious\n\n【34】disorder， dysphagia， blurred vision， fever， cough or chest pain. Those symptoms were constant， so he came to our hospital emergency room. His National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale(NIHSS) score was 2.\n\n【35】History of past illness\n\n【36】The patient had a normal medical history. There was no oth-er history， such as head trauma or drug abuse. He smoked for10 years， 20 cigarettes a day.\n\n【37】Physical examination\n\n【38】His temperature was 36.0℃ and his heart rate was 68 beats per minute. His blood pressure was 123/83 mm Hg and ox-ygen saturation in room air was 99%. There was no obvious abnormality in other general medical examination. On neuro-logical examination， there was no aphasia， agnosia， or apraxia. Motor examination revealed mild weakness (Medical Research Council \\[MRC\\] grade，5-/5) of the left limbs. There were absent of a stiff neck and the Kerning sign. The remaining neurolog-ical examination findings presented normal.\n\n【39】Laboratory examinations\n\n【40】The routine hematological， urinary and biochemical test find-ings were entirely normal. The findings of coagulation func-tion tests were normal. Electrocardiogram and chest x-ray were also normal. Serological tests revealed homocysteine (HCY) was47.6 umol/L. The anti-phospholipid antibodies (including lu-pus anticoagulant and anti-cardiolipin antibodies) were neg-ative. Antinuclear antibody (ANA)， anti-double stranded DNA(anti-dsDNA)， anti-Sjogren’s syndrome A/B (anti-SSA/SSB)， and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (P-ANCA) were negative.\n\n【41】Imaging examinations\n\n【42】A brain computed tomography (CT) that was done at the emergency room showed irregular high-density in the right superior frontal sulcus which was diagnosed with right corti-cal subarachnoid hemorrhage (Figure 1A-1C). Neck vascular ultrasound showed no atherosclerosis and stenosis. The re-sults of a 24-hour dynamic electrocardiogram (ECG) and trans-esophageal echocardiogram (TEE) were normal. The patient underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ce-rebrospinal fluid (CSF) test. Diffusion-weighted images (DWI) showed tiny hyperintensity in the right frontal lobe and co-rona radiata and hypointensity in the apparent diffusion co-efficient (ADC)， and he was diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke (Figure 1D-1l). The fluid-attenuated inversion recov-ery (FLAIR) image showed hyperintensity in the right frontal lobe (Figure 1J， 1K) which suggested it was an acute ischemic\n\n【43】lesion. The FLAIR showed striped hyperintensity in the right su-perior frontal sulcus (Figure 1L) was diagnosed as cSAH. There was severe stenosis or occlusion in the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) on the magnetic resonance angiography MRA(Figure 1M). Rupture of intracranial aneurysms was exclud-ed by the brain MRA. Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) showed that there were microbleeds in the right frontal lobe， temporal lobe， basal ganglia and thalamus (Figure 2A-2D). Finally， the digital subtraction angiography (DSA) of the neck and head was performed on the 10th day. It showed that the right MCA M1 segment was severely stenosed with a degree of 90% (Figure 1N) and the right posterior circulation was nor-mal (Figure 10)， and it excluded a few causes of hemorrhages such as vascular malformations (dural arteriovenous fistulas， pial arteriovenous malformations， reversible cerebral vasocOn-striction syndrome， vasculitides， arterial dissection， cerebral ve-nous thrombosis，and aneurysm. The patient's headache was mild and not thunderclap-like，and the results of MRA and DSA showed severely stenosed right MCA M1 segment， no “bead-ing” in the ipsilateral of other arteries (distal MCA， anterior ce-rebral arteries \\[ACA\\]， right internal carotid artery \\[RICA\\]， right vertebral artery \\[RVA\\]， and basilar artery \\[BA\\]) (Figure 1M-10)， so reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome was exclud-ed from the cause of cSAH. There were no basal collaterals or\n\n【44】left ICA or M1 narrowing which did not suggest an early stage of moyamoya syndrome (Figure 1M-10).\n\n【45】Further diagnostic work-up\n\n【46】The angiotensin-converting-enzyme level was in the normal range. The results of hepatitis screening were negative. The CSF study was performed in the 4h day and the results revealed zero white blood cell， one red blood cell， CSF protein 0.28 g/L， and CSF glucose 3.3 mmol/L.\n\n【47】Final diagnosis\n\n【48】The final diagnosis of the presented case was cortical sub-arachnoid hemorrhage in combination with acute ischemic stroke， and hyperhomocysteinemia.\n\n【49】Treatment\n\n【50】Considering the brain CT and MRI findings， the patient was given： Shuxuetong injection to improve cerebrocirculation and cerebrometabolism， edaravone injection to eliminate free rad-icals， aspirin to antiplatelet aggregation， rosuvastatin to low-er lipid and stabilize plaque， and folic acid， vitamin B6 and\n\n【51】Qin W. et al.：\n\n【52】Figure 1.

Upon completion of 2 weeks of therapy， the patient had fully recov-ered， and was discharged to hospital and continued to take aspirin， rosuvastatin， folic acid， vitamin B6， and vitamin B12.\n\n【56】The patient was asymptomatic at the 2-month and 8-month fol-low-up (NIHSS 0). Follow-up for MCA stenosis by brain MRA rule out stenosis due to spasm， while reversible cerebral vasocon-striction syndrome could be excluded from the cause of cSAH.\n\n【57】Cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage (cSAH) is a kind of cerebro-vascular disease different from aneurysmal SAH； it accounts for7.5% of nontraumatic SAH， but the prevalence is likely high er in the general population because it is poorly characterized or even hidden in clinical presentations \\[1，2\\].cSAH has been associated with different vascular pathologies which involve pial arteriovenous malformations， dural arteriovenous fistula， arterial dissection， dural or cortical cerebral venous thrombo-sis， vasculitides， reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome， posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome， high-grade ste-nosis (such as severe atherosclerotic carotid disease)， endo-carditis， cerebral amyloid angiopathy， coagulation disorders， abscess，cavernomas， brain tumors， moyamoya disease， throm-bocytopenia and others \\[1，2，6，9-13\\]. Reversible cerebral vaso-constriction syndrome or cerebral venous thrombosis is usu-ally deduced to be the main cause of cSAH when patients are younger than 60 years of age \\[3，4，14-16\\]. Infective endocar-ditis has been identified as a cause of cSAH， with or without associated mycotic aneurysms \\[17\\]， however， we have not en-countered any patients with IE and cSAH on brain MRI.\n\n【58】When a thunderclap headache peaks at the beginning， pre-senting as explosive， severe， and unexpected， clinicians should at least be able to distinguish SAH， cerebral venous thrombo-sis， arterial dissection \\[15，18-23\\]. In our patient case， there was no evidence of cerebral venous thrombosis and arterial dissection. The results of infection， coagulation， and vasculi-tis screening tests were negative.\n\n【59】In addition， reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome is characterized by thunderclap headache， with cSAH，reversible focal neurological deficits， or epileptic seizures \\[24-26\\]. The re-versible arterial lesion can be diagnosed by MRA or ultrasound within 3 months. In our case， headache was not thunderclap and was slight， and the results of MRA and DSA showed the M1segment of the right MCA was severely stenosed， not multifo-cal segmental cerebral artery vasoconstriction like“beading”in the ipsilateral other arteries (distal MCA， ACA， RICA， RVA， and BA)， so we could exclude this headache from the cause of re-versible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome. According to the follow-up brain MRA imaging， we deduced that reversible ce-rebral vasoconstriction syndrome was not the cause of cSAH in combination with DSA， and the critical elements of the di-agnosis of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome \\[27\\]. Although high-grade atherosclerotic stenosis of right MCA was the cause of cSAH， the patient did not undergo further extra-cranial-intracranial bypass or endovascular stenting treatment due to family financial difficulties.\n\n【60】A case of presumably acute symptomatic severe stenosis of right MCA and persistent focal deficits， combination with cSAH\n\n【61】in a young adult has not been previously reported. IN our pa-tient case， smoking and hyperhomocysteinemia were 2 risk factors for atherosclerosis. Hyperhomocysteinemia is an in-dependent risk factor of cerebral apoplexy， whose detrimental effect is caused by ischemia and involves the increase of ROS and post-translational modifications of proteins \\[28\\]. There have been many studies that described mild hyperhomocys-teinemia that produced an impact on arterial atherosclerotic modifications and then increased the risk for clinical presen-tations of stroke \\[29-34\\]. Acute ischemic infarction was diag-nosed by MRI on the ipsilateral of cSAH， and both MRA and DSA suggested that the right MCA M1 segment was severely stenosed， which was suspected to be the main cause of isch-emic stroke and cSAH in our case. The pathological mecha-nism is related to compensatory pial vasodilation and vulner-ability. The mechanism of cSAH is presumed in cases of severe atherosclerotic stenosis of the middle cerebral arteries by the break of expanded tenuous compensatory pial vessels 5，7，35， combined with the failure of cerebrovascular autoregulatory mechanisms. The changes in local blood flow and perfusion pressure occur at the same time of the infarction， or a small amount of bleeding is caused by the rupture of blood vessels when an embolus reaches fragile collateral vessels.\n\n【62】The clinical presentations of cSAH are diverse due to diverse causes \\[36\\]. Because a small amount of hemorrhage is in the cortical sulcus of the brain， most cSAHs do not have the typi-cal features of ruptured aneurysms， such as severe headache， neck stiffness， and disturbance of consciousness \\[3\\]. The clin-ical presentations of cSAH in patients under 60-year-old are headache including acute onset headache， gradual aggrava-tion headache or mild headache，which was different than the typical thunderclap headache of aneurysmal SAH \\[4\\]， and dif-ferent from no headache or mild headache， transient apha-sia， dysarthria， ataxia， limb weakness， or sensory disturbance of transient ischemic attack (TIA) \\[37\\]. A large proportion of cSAH patients are easily initially misdiagnosed as TIA， and thus neurologists should place high attention to potential cSAH.\n\n【63】The diagnosis of cSAH mainly depends on neuroimaging. The main findings of CT in cSAH are focal strip-like or linear high-density along the sulcus of the cerebral cortex with one convex surface or several adjacent ones， usually unilateral. cSAH is constrained to at least 1 or more than 2 sulci and generally includes the central sulcus， followed by the precentral sulcus and the intraparietal sulcus \\[38\\]. cSAH is easy to miss on non-enhanced brain CT whose sensitivity falls off quickly after 1-to2-day onset of the disease， whereas MRl is used as a comple-mentary diagnostic method \\[5，39\\]. cSAH is visible as focal lin-ear hyperintensity along the sulcus in FLAIR sequence. SWl is of great value to diagnosing cSAH， and better than GRE T2 se-quences in detecting microbleed and cortical hemosiderin \\[5\\]. cSAH is an unusual presentation of SAH as it is localized to\n\n【64】the convexities of the brain and usually limited to adjacent sulci \\[4\\]， and manifestations present as linear hypointensity in the subarachnoid space affecting ≥1 cortical sulci of the cere-bral convexities on T2\\* GRE/SWI sequences with correspond-ing hyperintensity in the subarachnoid space on T1-weighted and/or FLAlRimages \\[40J. Cerebral microbleeds are the deposi-tion of blood component decomposition products leaked from cerebral small vessels in normal or near normal tissue， whose pathology is confirmed to be small perivascular hemosiderin deposits and whose severity can be evaluated on T2-GRE/SWI according to microbleed anatomic rating scale \\[41，42\\]. In our case， right frontotemporal lobe sulcus hemorrhage in CT was further confirmed by the FLAIR sequence. MRA and DSA indi-cated M1 segment stenosis in the right MCA， which was help-ful for the etiology diagnosis of cSAH with acute cerebral in-farction. Except for cSAH cases identified by brain CT， further brain MRl including FLAIR and SWl sequences should be per-formed to confirm the diagnosis and to actively explore for the possible causes.\n\n【65】The treatments of cSAH mainly include etiological treatment and symptomatic treatment \\[43\\]. However， the treatment prin-ciples for cSAH patients secondary to carotid intracranial or extracranial stenosis or occlusion with TIA or cerebral infarc-tion are not clear. Whether antithrombotic medicine can be given as early as possible still needs to be further confirmed by large-scale evidence-based medicine research. There are no secondary prevention guidelines for young adults with stroke， but long-term treatment by antiplatelet is recommended after\n\n【66】References：\n\n【67】1\\.

Therefore， antiplatelet， statin， lowering homocysteine and neuroprotective therapies were applied in our patient case and proven to be safe and effective after follow-up. Finally， it is important to identify the underlying causes of cSAH， not only for the need for early di-agnosis and prompt exactitude therapy， but also for progno-sis \\[36\\]. If cSAH is misdiagnosed， it may lead to potentially harmful treatments， then result in iatrogenic bleeding risk \\[2\\]\n\n【80】Conclusions\n\n【81】cSAH is an unusual complication of acute ischemic stroke in young adults. Because of diverse clinical presentations and etiologies， we should pay close attention to this uncommon cause of high-grade atherosclerotic stenosis of the cerebral arteries， and hyperhomocysteinemia as the cause of cSAH in the young ischemic stroke patients.\n\n【82】Acknowledgements\n\n【83】We would like to thank Editage (www.editage.cn) for English language editing.\n\n【84】Conflict of interest\n\n【85】None.\n\n【86】11\\.

The 1-，5-and 10-year disease-specific survival rates in patients with collecting duct carcinoma are 69%， 34% and 14%，respectively \\[2\\].\n\n【28】No standard treatment regimens exist for collecting duct carcinoma and neither immunotherapy nor chemothera-py are particularly effective. Chemotherapy for urothelial cancer is usually used， but the results are generally disap-pointing \\[2，3\\]. There are few reports of vascular endothe-lial growth factor-targeted therapy in patients with collect-ing duct carcinoma. We describe a patient with metastatic disease who received chemotherapy plus bevacizumab fol-lowed by bevacizumab maintenance therapy.\n\n【29】CASE REPORT\n\n【30】A 44-year-old man with no significant medical history pre-sented with hematuria. A tumor was detected in the right kidney using ultrasound and confirmed by CT scan. The patient underwent right radical nephrectomy (July 2008). Pathologic an alysis revealed renal collecting (Bellini) duct carcinoma： the 7 cm tumor was stage pT3apN0， Fuhrman grade 3. Immunohistochemistry showed a positive stain for Ulex Europaeus (typical of Bellini duct carcinomas) and cy-tokeratin-8， but a negative for thyroid transcription factor l (excluding metastasis of a lung carcinoma).\n\n【31】One year later (June 2009) PET-CT scans revealed several secondary pulmonary lesions ~1 cm diameter with bilater-al hilar lymphadenopathies and evidence of locoregional relapse consisting on several nodular centimetric lung me-tastases and bilateral fluorodeoxyglucose (18F)-positive hi-lar adenopathies. Wedge excision showed adenocarcinoma expressing Ulex Europaeus. Thyroid transcription factor l and carcinoembryonic antigen were negative. The pa-tient’s only symptom was chronic cough while his perfor-mance status was nornal.\n\n【32】Chemotherapy (gemcitabine， cisplatin and bevacizumab) was started following informed consent： cisplatin 70 mg/m²on day l and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m’on days 1， 8 and 15， every 4 weeks， plus bevacizumab 6.5 mg/kg every 3 weeks. During chemotherapy， grade 2 neutropenia and thrombo-cytopenia were observed.\n\n【33】After 2 cycles of chemotherapies，thoracic CT scans showed good response to treatment， with almost complete regres-sion of the pulmonary lesions. However， scans revealed a pulmonary embolism of the segmental artery (lower-left lobe)； the patient was asymptomatic and started treatment with a low-molecular-weight heparin. A third cycle of cispl-atin-gemcitabine-bevacizumab was given， then chemother-apy was stopped and maintenance treatment with bevaci-zumab every 3 weeks continued. Maintenance therapy was well-tolerated. Eleven months after diagnosing pulmonary metastases， disease was clinically/radiologically stable with-out sign of tumor progression.\n\n【34】Fifteen months (September 2010) after diagnosing pulmo-nary metastases， hilar adenopathies progressed slightly and cisplatin-gemcitabine was started again leading to a partial response after five courses. Approximately 2 years after the diagnosis of lung metastases (May 2011)， the patient was well and still receiving bevacizumab maintenance therapy but presented a second relapse， so carboplatin-gemcitabine was started， while bevacizumab was continued.\n\n【35】As of June 2011， 35 months after the initial diagnosis and24 months after the diagnosis of lung metastases， the pa-tient was still alive with controlled disease.\n\n【36】DISCUSSION\n\n【37】Combination cisplatin and gemcitabine with low-dose bev-acizumab followed by bevacizumab maintenance therap\n\n【38】PY\n\n【39】y produced a complete response lasting 12 months in a pa-tient with metastatic collecting duct carcinoma. At relapse， the same regimen was restarted leading to partial remission. The disease is under control 24 months after the diagnosis of pulmonary metastases.\n\n【40】There appears to be only one published report describing the use of an anti-angiogenic agent in collecting duct car-cinoma. Two patients were treated with radical nephrecto-my and four courses of adjuvant chemotherapy with cispl-atin-gemcitabine； multiple-site metastases and mediastinal lymphopathy were subsequently observed and survival time was 8 months \\[4\\]. At relapse， both patients were treated with second-line sunitinib. Multiple liver， lung， and bone me-tastases and mediastinal lymphopathy were observed after2 cycles of therapy and both patients died eight weeks lat-er. Their survival time was 8 months from initial diagnosis.\n\n【41】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【42】The concept of bevacizumab maintenance therapy is rela-tively new and data from prospective clinical trials in ovar-ian cancer are just emerging \\[5\\]. In view of our findings， a prospective multicen ter trial with cisplatin， gemcitabine and bevacizumab in patients with metastatic collecting duct carcinoma is planned.\n\n【43】REFERENCES：\n\n【44】1\\.

A case is reported of a 40-year-old man who presented with a scalp mass that was diagnosed histologically as PCFCL. Imaging of the head and neck identified diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) involving the parotid gland and cervical lymph nodes， which responded well to radiation therapy.\n\n【29】Case Report：\n\n【30】A 40-year-old African American man presented with a two-year history of a progressively enlarging scalp mass that measured 10.5x7.1x6.6 cm. Histology showed a low-grade lymphoma with a follicular pattern. Immunohistochemistry was positive for B-cell markers and Bcl-6， consistent with a diagnosis of PCFCL. Computed tomography (CT) identified a 4.9x3.7×3.4 cm mass in the left parotid gland with bilateral cervical lymphadenop-athy that had been present for the previous two or three months. The diagnosis of DLBCL was made on histol-ogy from a needle biopsy. Treatment began with rituximab， etoposide， prednisone， vincristine， cyclophospha-mide， and doxorubicin (R-EPOCH) chemotherapy， followed by radiation therapy to the scalp， both sides of the neck， and left parotid gland. At four-month follow-up， combined positron emission tomography (PET) and CT showed only diffuse low-level uptake in the scalp and parotid gland.\n\n【31】Conclusions：\n\n【32】Transformation of low-grade PCFCL to high-grade DLBCL is rare， and the approach to treatment varies. This case showed a good response to chemotherapy and radiation therapy.\n\n【33】MeSH Keywords： Lymphoma， Large B-Cell， Diffuse ·Lymphoma， Non-Hodgkin·\n\n【34】Lymphoma， Primary Cutaneous Anaplastic Large Cell\n\n【35】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/917389\n\n【36】Primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL)， also known as Crosti's lymphoma， is a low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lym-phoma (NHL) that has an indolent clinical course with a 95%5-year survival rate \\[1\\]. However， transformation of PCFCL to a high-grade B-cell lymphoma， which has a more aggres-sive clinical course， is associated with a poor prognosis \\[1\\]. Although transformation of PCFCL to diffuse large B-cell lym-phoma (DLBCL) has previously been reported， the incidence， management， and prognosis have not been well described \\[1\\].\n\n【37】A case is reported of a 40-year-old man who presented with a scalp mass that was diagnosed histologically as a PCFCL Imaging of the head and neck identified DLBCL involving the parotid gland and cervical lymph nodes， which responded well to chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy.\n\n【38】A 40-year-old African-American man presented with more than a two-year history of an enlarging scalp mass. He also noticed swelling in his left facial region and lymphadenopathy in his neck during the previous two to three months. He reported one episode of night sweats and weight loss of 20 lbs during the previous month but had no other complaints. His past med-ical history included diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He had no previous history of malignancy or immunosuppression.\n\n【39】On physical examination， a 10 cm fungating mass was present in the left frontoparietal scalp region (Figure 1A). A separate mass was noted in his left parotid region， and there was bi-lateral cervical lymphadenopathy. A punch biopsy of the scalp lesion was obtained. The histology showed a low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with the formation of indistinct lym-phoid follicles. Immunohistochemistry showed that the lym-phoma cells were positive for Bcl-6. The histology of the scalp lesion was in keeping with a diagnosis of primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL) (Figure 1B).\n\n【40】Figure 1.

Magnification x40.\n\n【44】A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and neck showed a 10.5×7.1×6.6 cm nodular exophytic mass of the left fronto-parietal scalp without erosion into the bone. A 4.9x3.7×3.4cm mass was found in the left parotid gland， and extensive bilat-eral cervical lymphadenopathy was present， with the largest lymph node measuring approximately 2 cm.\n\n【45】An excisional biopsy of the parotid mass showed a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The cells showed positive im-munostaining for CD20 with a high Ki-67 proliferation rate of80-90% (Figure 2). There was no MYC gene rearrangement， which excluded a diagnosis of a double-hit or triple-hit lym-phoma. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed hypermetabolic activity of the scalp mass， with a standardized uptake value (SUV) of 14.7， the left parotid gland mass had a SUV of 11.1， and the bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy in-cluded a right hilar lymph node with a SUV of 2.8 (Figure 3). Laboratory tests showed an increased serum lactate dehy-drogenase (LDH) (287U/L) and an increased erythrocyte sed-imentation rate (ESR) (14 mm/hr). A bone marrow biopsy and lumbar puncture were performed， both of which were nega-tive for lymphoma. Given the long history of the scalp mass and rapid progression of the parotid and neck masses， the patient was clinically diagnosed with stage llE DLBCL trans-formed from the stage IE PCFCL of the scalp. However， gene rearrangement studies were not performed to confirm clon-ality and the transformation in this case.\n\n【46】Treatment commenced with rituximab， etoposide， prednisone， vincristine， cyclophosphamide， and doxorubicin (R-EPOCH) che-motherapy.

PET-CT imaging showed a reduction in both the size and SUV of the scalp mass that measured 6x1.5 cm(SUV 1.8) and the left parotid mass that measured 2.5x0.9cm(SUV 1.4)， and there was resolution of the cervical lymphade-nopathy. Given the presence of residual disease on PET-CT， the patient continued to receive chemotherapy with a further two cycles of R-EPOCH. Following the completion of eight cycles of chemotherapy PET-CT imaging was repeated， which remained unchanged with the scalp mass measuring 6x1.5 cm (SUV1.9) and the parotid mass measuring 2.4x0.9 cm (SUV 1.7). The patient also received four doses of prophylactic intrathe-cal methotrexate. Subsequent analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was negative. The patient was then referred for radiation therapy.\n\n【50】Radiation therapy began with 36 Gy in 18 fractions to the whole scalp， bilateral neck， and left parotid followed by a boost of 9 Gy in five fractions to the residual scalp and parotid le-sions. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with image guidance was used. A custom bolus was applied to the scalp throughout the course of treatment. An 11-field IMRT plan was used for the initial phase， and a five-field IMRT plan was\n\n【51】used for the final phase， both with 6 MV photons. The treat-ment was given and completed as planned， and radiation to the organs at risk was kept within accepted tolerances. The pa-tient experienced only grade 1 skin toxicity and grade 2 sali-vary gland toxicity. He responded well to radiation， and at four months post-treatment was without evidence of disease on physical examination. PET-CT imaging at four-month follow-up showed only diffuse low-level uptake in the scalp (SUV 1.8) and parotid gland (SUV 1.5) (Figure 4).\n\n【52】Discussion\n\n【53】Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) accounts for approximately 4%of all malignancies and has an incidence of 19.5 per 100，000population \\[2\\]. The most common type of NHL is derived from B-cells and accounts for 80-95% of NHL while the remainder of NHLs are of T-cell or NK cell origin \\[3\\]. B-cell NHL is hetero-geneous with a wide range of low-grade and high-grade sub-types diagnosed on histopathology. The two most common sub-types of B-cell NHL are follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)， which comprise approximately 65%of all cases of NHL \\[3\\].NHL commonly arises from lymphocytes\n\n【54】Table 1. Comparison of this case with previously two previously published case reports of transformation of primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL) to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) \\[8，9\\].\n\n| Author  | Patient age (yrs)/ gender  | Site of PCFCL/DLBCL  | Treatment  | Outcome  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Case Report  | 40/Male  | Scalp/Parotid gland andcervical lymph nodes  | R-EPOCH chemotherapy andconsolidative radiotherapy  | Complete response  |\n| Coelho et al.， 2010\\[8\\]  | 44/Male  | Back/Stomach  | R-CHOP，R-ESHAP， GEMROX， and IFM/VP16 chemotherapy  | No response  |\n| Perkovic et al.，2017 \\[9\\]  | 60/Male  | Chest/DisseminatedDLBCL  | Surgical resection and R-CHOPchemotherapy  | Complete response  |\n\n【56】PCFCL - primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma； DLBCL - diffuse large B-cell lymphoma； R-ESHAP - rituximab， etoposide， solumedrone， high-dose cytarabine， and cisplatin； GEMROX -gemcitabine， rituximab， and oxaliplatin； IFM/VP16-ifosfamide， and etoposide； R-CHOP - rituximab， cyclophosphamide， doxorubicin， vincristine， and prednisolone.\n\n【57】present in the lymph nodes， spleen， and Waldeyer’s ring， but about 25-40% of cases of NHL are extranodal lymphomas \\[4\\].\n\n【58】The most common sites ofextranodal lymphoma are the gas-trointestinal (Gl) tract， skin， bone， and brain， but they can arise in almost any tissue \\[5\\]. The most common type of pri-mary cutaneous NHL is cutaneous T-cell lymphoma， with the second most common type being primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma (PCBCL) \\[6\\]. PCBCL is a rare malignancy with an estimated annual incidence of 3.1 new cases per 1，000，000population \\[6\\]. PCBCL includes primary marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (PCMZL)， primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (PCDLBCL)， and primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL). PCFCL accounts for approximately 30% of all cases of PCBCL， with an estimated annual incidence of 0.9new cases per 1，000，000 population \\[6\\]. PCFCL usually pres-ents as solitary or group of lesions on the upper body， and the diagnosis is made on histopathology \\[5\\].\n\n【59】PCFCL is a slow-growing lymphoma with a good prognosis， depending on the location， but has a high rate of local recur-rence \\[5\\]. PCFCL of the head and scalp has an estimated 5-year survival of 95% \\[5\\]. Treatment is by radiation therapy， but sur-gery or even clinical observation are treatment options for small foci of PCFCL \\[5\\]. However， a recognized risk associated with PCFCL is transformation or progresssion to a more aggressive form \\[5\\]. The rate of transformation of PCFCL is unknown， but follicular lymphoma has been reported to have a 3% annual risk of transformation \\[7\\]. A review of the published literature has identified two previously reported cases of transformation of PCFCL to DLBCL (Table 1) \\[8，9\\].\n\n【60】One of the two previously reported cases was of a 44-year-old Caucasian man with a ten-year history of slowly enlarg-ing skin lesions on his back that were initially biopsied and di-agnosed as an inflammatory pseudolymphomatous reaction， treated with tetracycline that resolved after sun exposure \\[8\\].\n\n【61】Three years later， he presented with epigastric pain and weight loss and was diagnosed with gastric DLBCL from a gastric bi-opsy \\[8\\]. Review of the histopathology from his prior back le-sions showed a low-grade B-cell NHL that was weakly positive for Bcl-2， negative for CD10， and positive for CD20 and Bcl-6， which resulted in a change in diagnosis to PCFCL \\[8\\]. An identi-cal clonal VH-JH gene rearrangement was identified in both the PCFCL and the DLBCL cells that confirmed transformation \\[8\\]. The patient received chemotherapy with rituximab， cyclophos-phamide， doxorubicin， vincristine， and prednisolone (R-CHOP)， but with no improvement \\[8\\]. An additional three lines of che-motherapy were given that included rituximab， etoposide， sol-umedrone， high-dose cytarabine， and cisplatin (R-ESHAP)，gem-citabine， rituximab， and oxaliplatin (GEMROX)， and ifosfamide and etoposide (IFM/VP16)， but with no response (Table 1) \\[8\\].\n\n【62】The second of the two previously reported cases was of a 60-year-old man who was initially diagnosed with a PCBCL lesion on his chest \\[9\\]. The patient underwent surgery to re-move the lesion and experienced a local recurrence two years later \\[9\\]. The recurrence was noted to be slow-growing， and he was managed conservatively by clinical observation \\[9\\]. After ten years of observation， the lesion began to grow rapidly and disseminate \\[9\\]. A biopsy showed primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (PCDLBCL) \\[9\\]. The patient was treated with R-CHOP， which resulted in a complete response， and he was reported to be disease-free for three-years at the time of this report (Table 1) \\[9\\].\n\n【63】Studies on follicular lymphoma support that clonal transforma-tion of PCFCL to DLBCL is associated with poor prognosis \\[7\\]. The 5-year survival following the transformation of follicu-lar lymphoma into DLBCL ranges from an estimated 10-66%， based on the extent of disease， with limited disease having a better prognosis \\[7\\]. However， there has been improved sur-vival of patients with transformed DLBCL following the use of rituximab， with some studies showing a 5-year survival ranging\n\n【64】from 46-72%. Furthermore， the recently reported National LymphoCare Study， which looked at the incidence， prognos-tic features， and outcomes associated with transformation in2，642 patients with follicular lymphoma found that patients presenting with transformation at diagnosis had 5-year pro gression-free survival (PFS)， and an overall survival (OS) of66% and 88%， respectively， which is similar to patients with out transformation \\[10\\]. Treatment for patients with trans-formed PCFCL into DLBCL follows that for DLBCL， with chemo-therapy using R-CHOP or R-EPOCH， and adjuvant therapy as indicated \\[11\\].R-EPOCH may be a better treatment in patients with high Ki-67 expression， which is a marker of cell prolif-eration， and low-intermediate International Prognostic Index(IPI) \\[12\\]. As this case has shown， transformed lymphoma is a challenging disease to treat as there are yet no clear man-agement guidelines.\n\n【65】References：\n\n【66】1\\.

PCFCL usually has an excellent prognosis with an average 5-year survival of 95%. However， the transformation of PCFCL into a more aggressive form has an uncertain prognosis， and there are no guidelines on clinical management. Because the transformation of follic-ular lymphoma to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has associated with a poor outcome， but recent developments in chemotherapy have improved the outcome. However， clini-cal studies on the prognosis of transformed PCFCL and treat-ment outcomes are awaited. Two previously reported cases of transformation of PCFCL to DLBCL showed different out-comes following chemotherapy， which supports the need for further studies to determine the optimal treatment in cases of PCFCL transformation. It remains to be seen what the long-term outcome will be for the patient described in this report.\n\n【74】Conflict of interest\n\n【75】None.\n\n【76】7\\.

Although pseudoaneurysms are common， occurrence in the location of the superior rectal artery is exceedingly rare， has been documented in the literature only 7 times， and can be ex-tremely dangerous. Patients can present with vague abdominal complaints， pain， gastrointestinal bleeding， and development of hematomas， and can progress to hemodynamic instability related to hypovolemia. This phe-nomenon requires swift recognition and patient management， as well as stabilization， to achieve desired re-sults and minimize morbidity and mortality.\n\n【16】Case Report： We report the case of a 79-year-old man who presented after minor trauma with gastrointestinal bleeding and was diagnosed with a retroperitoneal hematoma. Although he was stabilized and discharged， conventional angiography diagnosing and treating his causative superior rectal artery pseudoaneurysm was not completed until a second traumatic event resulted in recurrent presentation with worsened symptoms and retroperito-neal hematoma enlargement.\n\n【17】Conclusions： Superior rectal artery pseudoaneurysm is a rarely-reported phenomenon， usually occurring after a traumatic event. It can lead to significant anemia， hypovolemic shock， blood transfusion， and other serious consequences. It can be difficult to diagnose given its location and obscurity. However， upon diagnosis， swift treatment is rec-ommended， for which a variety of both surgical and endovascular approaches have been employed to prevent exsanguination.\n\n【18】MeSH Keywords： Aneurysm， False· Angiography· Anticoagulants · Hematoma · Retroperitoneal Space\n\n【19】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/924529\n\n【20】￥口116 4 2 1 甘6 14\n\n【21】Pseudoaneurysm can be common within the human anatomy， in which a perivascular hematoma develops due to disruption of the vascular wall layers and results in a communicating he matoma \\[1\\]. This entity， although common in other vessels， is extremely rare in the superior rectal artery (SRA) and has been reported in only 7 published cases \\[2-8\\]. Although several of the prior reports were related to traumatic events and the others were caused by unique， varying factors， their presenting symp-toms and treatment modalities were strikingly similar and suc-cessful. Here， we describe the presentation and hospital course of a 79-year-old man on therapeutic anticoagulation， who pre-sented several days after a ground-level fall with complaints of abdominal pain， constipation requiring manual disimpac-tion， and subsequent gastrointestinal bleeding. At that time， he was diagnosed with a large retroperitoneal hematoma， sta-bilized， and discharged. It was not until after the patient's sec-ond fall approximately 4 weeks later， for which he presented with worsened complaints and hematoma enlargement， that a bleeding SRA pseudoaneurysm was identified as the cause of his symptoms. Here， we discuss the hospital course and patient\n\n【22】Figure 1. Initial presenting imaging of retroperitoneal hematoma.

We describe a 79-year-old man who initially presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with acute onset of abdom-inal and rectal pain， as well as 1 episode of rectal bleeding. He reported that he had recently fallen 3-4 days prior to presenta-tion and had been constipated， requiring manual disimpaction， which caused bleeding. Of note， he was on warfarin for a history of atrial fibrillation； thus， due to his symptoms and history， he un-derwent computed tomography angiography (CTA). His CTA was significant for a large， poorly-defined， retroperitoneal hematoma extending from the right abdomen into the pelvis， without ob-vious active bleeding (Figures 1，2). Because a large hematoma was identified， his anticoagulation was held， serial abdominal examinations were performed， and his hemoglobin was serially\n\n【26】Figure 2.

On presentation， his hemoglobin was 13.0 gm/dL； how-ever， over the next 24 h it decreased to 8.5 gm/dL The patient became tachycardic and thus was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells and 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma for an international normalized ratio of 1.7. His hemoglobin was then stable after transfusion for several days and remained stable af-ter resumption of warfarin， and he was then discharged.\n\n【29】The patient was scheduled for repeat CTA imaging in 6 weeks， but 4 weeks after discharge he returned to the ED with sim-ilar complaints of abdominal pain， constipation， and urinary retention. His hemoglobin was stable upon his return， but he unfortunately signed out of the ED against medical advice pri-or to receiving any further interventions. Two days later， he returned after another fall， with complaints of worsening ab-dominal pain， distention， constipation， and urinary retention. His hemoglobin was relatively stable； however， his CTA was re-peated， with new concerns for enlargement of the known ret-roperitoneal hematoma from the previous size of 9.0x4.5 cm to 9.9x7.4 cm， as well as signs of active bleeding and a ques-tionable pseudoaneurysm (Figures 3， 4). He underwent pel-vic and inferior mesenteric aitery (IMA) angiograms with Interventional Radiology (IR)， where a large blush off of the SRA was identified， suggestive of a pseudoaneurysm (Figure 5).\n\n【30】Figure 4. Increasing size of retroperitoneal hematoma with site of bleeding and pseudoaneurysm. After a second fall， the patient returned to the Emergency Department for further evaluation， where repeat computed tomography imaging was performed. The new imaging displayed a better-defined hematoma collection and an increase in hematoma size， indicated in this image by the white arrows with black outline.\n\n【31】Several attempts at embolization of the tiny feeding branch were unsuccessful； therefore， coil embolization of the SRA was performed (Figure 6). Following the procedure， the patient's hemoglobin and vital signs were stable within baseline param-eters. He was discharged home on post-procedure day 2 and continued on warfarin. He has yet to follow-up on an outpa-tient basis with either the Trauma or Interventional Radiology services. However， on evaluation in the ED for separate com-plaints， repeat imaging was performed，which demonstrated a slight decrease in his retroperitoneal hematoma to 9.0x7.0cm and his hemoglobin level was stable at baseline.\n\n【32】Discussion\n\n【33】Pseudoaneurysm is a perivascular hematoma that develops as the result of a partial disruption of the vascular layers， which maintains communication with the vascular structure \\[1\\].\n\n【34】Figure 5. Pelvic angiogram displaying a large superior rectal artery pseudoaneurysm. Demonstration of inferior mesenteric artery angiographic imaging in which a contrast blush suggestive of a superior rectal artery pseudoaneurysm was identified， indicated by black arrows.\n\n【35】The significant difference distinguishing pseudoaneurysm from aneurysm is the involvement of wall layers - a true aneurysm involves all vessel wall layers， while a pseudoaneurysm is only associated with partial wall layer involvement \\[1\\]. There are various known causes of pseudoaneurysm， most important-ly infection， inflammation， and trauma \\[2\\]. In addition， there can be significant complications associated with pseudoan-eurysms， including rupture， massive hemorrhage， adjacent structure compression， and infection \\[2\\]. Thus， given the se-rious risk of complications， especially with an associated rup-ture mortality risk of nearly 50%， early diagnosis and immedi-ate appropriate management are essential \\[2\\]. For diagnosis， imaging must be performed， for which the criterion standard is conventional angiography \\[1\\]. However， due to limitations in personnel and facility capabilities， pseudoaneurysms are often diagnosed via other imaging modalities such as ultrasound or contrast-enhanced computed tomography \\[1\\]. Another benefit of diagnosing pseudoaneurysm via conventional angiography is that conventional angiography can concomitantly be ther-apeutic \\[1\\]. Recommendations for management include angi-ographic embolization and/or stent placement， as well as the possible need for surgical intervention \\[2\\].\n\n【36】Initially， there were concerns for colonic ischemia and infarc-tion associated with angiographic embolization， which have since been resolved \\[9\\]. Prior angiographic interventions did\n\n【37】Figure 6.

This imaging shows no further active contrast blush， and the site of the coil embolization is indicated by black arrows.\n\n【38】not gain significant popularity due to the use of nonsteerable wires， and resulted in inadvertent dissections and emboliza-tion of marginal arteries， with subsequent ischemia \\[9\\]. With the development of steerable guidewires， the super-selective delivery of small embolization coils to vessels distal to the mar-ginal arteries could be achieved， which significantly lowered the colonic ischemia and infarction risk \\[3，9\\]. Proceeding with surgical intervention is indicated when angiographic treat-ment modalities fail or if the patient is hemodynamically un-stable \\[1\\]. There are several surgical options that can be used to achieve hemostasis， including pseudoaneurysm resection with bypass， ligation， or resection of the involved organ \\[1\\].\n\n【39】The occurrence of pseudoaneurysms throughout the body is of-ten reported， especially after vascular or cardiac interventions； however， involvement of the SRA is rare. Our thorough literature search found only 7 other documented cases -3 were related to trauma (2 were secondary to direct rectal injury， 1 occurred\n\n| Presenting symptoms  | Mechanism of injury  | Treatment modality  | Time to treatment  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Abdominal pain，  | Fall while on anticoagulation  | Angiographic coil embolization  | 4 weeks from initial presentation；  |\n| Gl bleed  | Fall while on anticoagulation  | of SRA  | 8 hours from re-presentation  |\n| Gl bleed  | Penetrating perineal wound  | Hartmann’s procedure， emergentHartmann's revision， subsequent  | PTD O， PTD 3， PTD 19  |\n|  |  | angiography  |  |\n|  |  | With Gelfoam embolization of  |  |\n|  |  | inferior mesenteric artery，  |  |\n|  |  | anterior branch of  |  |\n| Gl bleed  | Penetrating perineal wound  | Bilateral internal iliac arteries  | PTD 11， PTD 17  |\n| Gl bleed  | Penetrating perineal wound  | Celiotomy with sigmoid loop  | PTD 11， PTD 17  |\n| Gl bleed  | Penetrating perineal wound  | colostomy； angiography with  | PTD 11， PTD 17  |\n| Gl bleed  | Penetrating perineal wound  | N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA)  | PTD 11， PTD 17  |\n| Gl bleed  | Penetrating perineal wound  | embolization of SRA  | PTD 11， PTD 17  |\n| Gl bleed  | Endoscopic polypectomy  | Angiographic glue embolizationof SRA  | 10 days after polypectomy  |\n| Gl bleed  | Antiplatelet use  | Angiographic coil embolizationof SRA  | 10 days after symptom onset  |\n| Abdominal pain  | Renovascular hypertension，  | Angiographic coil embolization  | 6 weeks after initial presentation  |\n|  | fibrodysplasia  | of SRA  |  |\n| Gl bleed  | Tumor induced SRA rupture  | Angiographic embolization  | 1 day after symptom onset  |\n| Gl bleed  | History of bevacizumab  | Angiographic coil embolization  | Not reported  |\n| Gl bleed  | therapy  | of SRA  | Not reported  |\n| Drowsiness  | Acute head trauma  | Cerebral angiogram withHistoacryl MMA embolization  | Not reported  |\n| Headache， aphasia  | Head trauma  | Cerebral angiogram withglue MMA embolization  | PTD 5 months  |\n| Abdominal pain  | Apixaban use  | Endovascular coiling  | Immediate  |\n| Recurrent bleeding  | Head trauma  | Open surgical ligation  | PTD 4 weeks  |\n| Pain， swelling  | Laceration  | Open surgical ligation  | PTD 3 weeks  |\n\n【41】Summary of documented case details to aid in comparison of cases and results， including presenting symptom， mechanism， treatment modality， and time to treatment \\[2-8，10-14\\].

One patient presented with bleeding， likely related to clopidogrel use， another was reported with a histo-ry of renovascular hypertension secondary to fibrodysplasia，1 patient was recognized following malignant tumor erosion into the vessel， and 1 patient was identified after bevacizumab use for sigmoid adenocarcinoma \\[5-8\\]. Although the reported cases had various causes， their symptom complexes were sim-ilar. Six of the known cases presented with a chief complaint of lower-gastrointestinal bleeding \\[2-5，7，8\\]， and the remaining\n\n【43】patient presented with complaints of worsening abdominal pain \\[6\\]. In addition， although the causes varied， the manage-ment plans in each of these cases， as well as our own， followed the previously stated recommendations. In all of the reviewed cases， the patients were able to be safely treated via angio-graphic embolization， though 2 cases initially underwent open surgery \\[3-8\\]. In the published cases， the patients achieved he-modynamic stability and improvement in symptoms following intervention， without any reported pseudoaneurysm-related mortalities. As in the present case， the appropriate diagnosis\n\n【44】could not be identified on initial presentation， and develop-ment of pseudoaneurysm may have been a delayed compli-cation of the initial event. Regardless， delay in identification and management of a pseudoaneurysm can lead to worsen-ing and possibly life-threatening bleeding. Table 1 summa rizes the reported cases， their presenting symptoms，mecha-nism， treatment modality， and time to treatment， if available， for comparison and ease of review.\n\n【45】Finally， in addition to the rarity of this phenomenon occur-ring in the SRA， there have been multiple other rare occur-rences seen in other sites throughout the body. Inadvertently-discovered occurrences have been reported in the peripheral arteries as a known complication of percutaneous interven-tions， but there are other unique locations and occurrences that have occurred without interventions， similar to our case. Some of these other rare cases included involvement of the middle meningeal artery， superior mesenteric artery， occipital artery， and palmar arch \\[10-14\\].Such as the cases referenced in our SRA pseudoaneurysm review， these patients present-ed with varying symptoms， mechanisms， time to diagnosis， and treatment modalities. Their presenting symptoms were most commonly related to pseudoaneurysm location，and in-cluded drowsiness， headache， aphasia， pain， recurrent bleed-ing， and swelling \\[10-14\\]. The mechanisms also differed， with both traumatic and nontraumatic causes (acute head trauma， chronic development after head trauma， apixaban use， knife laceration) \\[10-14\\]. Similarly， treatment and time to treatment varied between endovascular and open approaches-imme-diate and months after initial injury， respectively.

In the 7 previ-ously published SRA pseudoaneurysm cases， and in our own， management techniques have yielded excellent results with minimal adverse effects and no mortalities. Given these find-ings， the success evidenced by angiographic management in our case and the significant adverse effects that are risked by delaying treatment， we are in agreement with the current rec-ommendations and strongly support intervening and actively managing SRA pseudoaneurysms without delay.\n\n【57】Disclosures\n\n【58】This report has been accepted for ePoster presentation at the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons(SAGES) Virtual Annual Meeting on August 12-15， 2020 in Cleveland， Ohio， USA.\n\n【59】Conflicts of interest\n\n【60】None.\n\n【61】8\\.

MS. India.\n\n【2】ABSTRACT Gallstone pancreatitis is a serious complication of gallstone disease. Early diagnosis is pivotal. History， laboratory tests and CECT are diagnostic. The severity assessment is necessary for planning optimum aggressive management. ERCP is indicated in patients of biliary pancreatitis with obstructed CBD stones complicated by cholangitis. Cholecystectomy is indicated after inflammatory markers have normalised suggesting the resolution of pancreatitis. Cholecystectomy should be done preferably during the index admission.\n\n【3】KEYWORDS Gallstone pancreatitis diagnosis management\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Gallstones continue to be a major cause of pancreatitis second only to alcohol. Majority of patients with biliary pancreatitis recover without significant complications. However， 15 to 30%of patients have severe episodes of pancreatitis necessitating multidisciplinary treatment to achieve promising results. \\[1\\]The pathophysiology of gallstone pancreatitis is still uncertain. A va-riety of theories have been put forward. Diagnosing pancreatitis and assessment of the severity in biliary pancreatitis provides a roadmap for further treatment. Whether the endoscopic in-tervention is the top priority in management will continue to be a controversial issue. \\[2\\]Therefore a holistic approach to understanding the mechanism of biliary pancreatitis is essential.\n\n【6】Pathophysiology\n\n【7】Acute biliary or gallstone pancreatitis is a potentially fatal condi-tion with an overall mortality of 2-7% despite the best of inter-vention and treatment. \\[2\\] The outcome is determined by two significant factors which reflect the severity of the illness viz. severity and number of organ failures and pancreatic necrosis. The exact mechanism is debatable. However， the most accept-able hypothesis is reflux of infected bile into the pancreatic duct due to transient obstruction of the ampulla during the passage of the gallstone. Reflux of infected bile into the pancreas activates a\n\n【8】cascade of digestive proteolytic enzymes. \\[3\\] Further persistent blockage of the pancreatic duct causes acinar disruption from raised pressure within the duct. This is supposedly the main triggering factor. Once the enzymes get activated， extensive destruction of the pancreatic tissue， as well as the surrounding tissues， takes place. This leads to the release of potent inflam-matory mediators， enhancing the inflammatory reaction. Based on experimental models， the intrapancreatic effects of activation of enzymes has been further studied. \\[4\\] There is the fusion of the zymogen granules with lysosomal vacuoles. This leads to the activation of proteolytic enzymes within the pancreas. Large volumes of trypsin are released which cause further ac-tivation of other enzymes resulting in a wide range of local and systemic complications. Phospholipase A2 is activated as well. Pulmonary surfactant is destroyed， thereby predisposing to ARDS. \\[5\\]High volumes of prostaglandins and leukotrienes are released which not only initiate but also propagate a severe systemic inflammatory response. If left unattended， this can lead to multiple organ failure. Trypsin further activates and compli-ments kinins. Kallikrein is a major kinin which is responsible for DIC， haemodynamic instability， shock and renal failure. \\[6\\]\n\n【9】Once the process of inflammation grips the pancreas， a wide range of complications， both systemic and local， can develop. Local complications include necrosis， pseudocyst， abscesses and haemorrhage. Systemic complications include pleural effusion， ARDS， renal insufficiency and multiorgan failure. These compli-cations have a deleterious impact on outcomes in such patients.\\[7. 8\\] The disease is more common in males though the inci-dence in women is also rising due to the increasing incidence of gallstones in women. Size of the stones is also a significant risk factor. Multiple small stones are usually associated with a high incidence of gallstone pancreatitis.\n\n【10】Sudden onset of severe excruciating pain is the chief present-ing symptom. The pain is epigastric in location and radiates to the back from the left side. Nausea and vomiting are com-mon accompaniments. History of biliary disease is present in the majority of the cases with a history of previous attacks of biliary colic. In a few select cases， the patient will give a history of jaundice， especially if there is a transient obstruction in the common bile duct caused by a passing gallstone. Charcot’s triad or Reynold's pentad may be seen in severe cases. \\[9\\]\n\n【11】The general examination will reveal severe tachycardia，pal-lor， dehydration and icterus. In severe cases， the patient may have hypotension. The respiratory rate will also be increased.\n\n【12】The abdominal examination will reveal tenderness， guarding or rigidity depending upon the severity of the disease.\n\n【13】Diagnosis\n\n【14】Laboratory tests play a major role in the diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis. A complete blood count will reveal leucocytosis and at times， even low haemoglobin. Serum amylase and lipase levels need to be interpreted carefully. Serum amylase is always elevated in pancreatitis. However， amylase is elevated in many other abdominal emergencies as well and therefore lacks speci-ficity. Serum amylase remains elevated in 75% of patients of biliary pancreatitis for 5 to 10 days. \\[9， 10\\]\n\n【15】However， serum lipase happens to be more specific. The half-life is much longer than amylase. The sensitivity in diagnosing acute pancreatitis is 90%. The usual acceptable diagnostic cut off is a level three times higher than the normal upper limit. \\[11\\]\n\n【16】Raised total bilirubin with predominantly a raised direct read-ing component is seen due to transient cholestasis caused by the passing stone. Alkaline phosphatase will be raised. A raised ALT> 150 IU/L has a specificity of 96% and sensitivity of 48% in diagnosing acute pancreatitis. \\[12， 13\\] Therefore， a raised ALT is diagnostic of biliary aetiology. However， a normal value of ALT does not exclude gallstone disease. A number of biochemical markers have been proposed. However， the majority of them are in an experimental stage and therefore， cannot be relied upon. C reactive protein is an excellent marker for the assessment of the inflammatory process. \\[13\\] A urine dipstick for trypsinogen has high sensitivity and specificity of 90% in diagnosing acute pancreatitis.13\n\n【17】Neoptolemos et al. have proposed a lucid scoring system for predicting the presence of CBD stones based on various laboratory parameters.\\[14\\] Serum bilirubin <2.5mg/dl，gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase < 250IU/L， alkaline phosphatase<225IU/L and age less than 70 years. Presence of all four had a predictive value of 93%. Serum bilirubin<2.5mg/dl in patients with severe pancreatitis was 85%.\\[14\\] Similar other predictive models were based on CBD diameter， maximum serum bilirubin， AST and alkaline phosphatase， which had a predictive value of76%.\\[15\\]\n\n【18】Laboratory investigations are helpful in determining the pres-ence and assessing the severity of the inflammatory process.\\[16\\] Laboratory investigations need to be supplemented by imaging to ascertain the disease process. It also provides a road map for developing a treatment plan. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is still the best modality for diagnosis and severity assessment of acute pancreatitis. CECT identifies pan-creatic oedema， necrosis， pseudocyst， abscesses， haemorrhage and vascular thrombosis. \\[17\\] Pancreatic necrosis is diagnosed\n\n【19】on CECT by identifying areas which lack glandular enhance-ment. This could be focal or diffuse depending upon the severity. The CT severity index based on findings was developed to quan-tify the severity of disease as prognosis largely depends on the extent of damage sustained by the pancreas. \\[18， 19\\] Higher severity scores are associated with increased morbidity and mor-tality. (Table 1， 2)\n\n【20】The only pitfall of CECT is that scans done within the first 24hours may be equivocal or falsely negative. Pancreatic necrosis is usually picked up on CECT after 24-72 hours.\n\n【21】MRCP is an excellent non-invasive investigation for evalu-ation of the biliary tract. It helps in identifying CBD stones， pancreatic and peripancreatic cysts. However， it is less sensitive in diagnosing smaller stones usually less than 4 mm， small pap-illary lesions and ductal strictures. MRCP， however， is devoid of interventional advantage.\\[11\\]\n\n【22】Endoscopic ultrasonography is yet another modality for di-agnosis. However， availability of expertise is a major limiting factor， especially in emergencies.\\[20\n\n【23】Severity assessment\n\n【24】Several scoring systems have been devised which can predict the severity of pancreatitis. Assessment of severity is important to plan the best management protocol. Several scoring systems are being used. These include Ranson's criteria， Glasgow (Imrie) scale， APACHE system and the CT severity index. \\[20， 21， 22\\] However， the most pertinent and lucid systems are the Glasgow scale and the CT severity index. (Table 3)\\[18， 19\\] Both are easy to evaluate and more accurate in gallstone pancreatitis.\n\n【25】Treatment\n\n【26】Conservative treatment is the mainstay of initial management. Correction of fluid and electrolyte depletion and bowel rest is of utmost importance in optimising the patient’s condition.\n\n【27】Deciding the intervention for stone removal is the next step. The timing of ERCP is crucial. ERCP is indicated only if there is documentary evidence of stones in the CBD. \\[23\\] In such a situation if cholangitis has set in， then ERCP with stenting needs to be done early. This will drain the accumulated bile and relieve the obstruction. The septic process will then be under much better control. This has then to be followed by cholecystectomy. However， if there is no evidence of stone in the CBD， which implies that the stone may have passed off， then conservative treatment is to be continued， which precludes the need for ERCP.\n\n【28】The timing of cholecystectomy continues to be the next de-batable issue. \\[24， 25\\] Many studies have been done. But have yielded conflicting results. The safest approach is to allow pan-creatitis to resolve confirmed by laboratory tests. Once inflam-matory markers have normalised， then cholecystectomy can be contemplated. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the preferred option. However， the severity of the initial inflammatory process will dictate the final choice of cholecystectomy. A low threshold for the conversion is a safer option. Delaying the cholecystec-tomy is a dangerous proposition as the further passage of stones could precipitate another attack. \\[26\\] Therefore it is essential that cholecystectomy should be performed during the index admission.\n\n【29】Table 1 Balthazar system for grading the severity of pancreatitis.\n\n| Severity  |  | Grade  | Score  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Inflammation  | Normal pancreas  | A  | 0  |\n|  | Diffuse pancreaticenlargement  | B  | 1  |\n|  | Inflammation of bancreas andperipancreatic fat  | C  | 2  |\n|  | Single fluid collectionor phlegmon  | D  | 3  |\n|  | Two or more fluidcollections orphlegmons  | E  | 4  |\n| Necrosis  | No necrosis  |  | 0  |\n|  | Necrosis of one third  |  | 2  |\n|  | Necrosis of one half  |  | 4  |\n|  | Necrosis > one half  |  | 6  |\n\n【31】Table 2 Balthazar system for grading the predicted complication and mortality rate in pancreatitis\n\n| Severity Index  | Complications (%)  | Mortality (%)  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 0-1  | 0  | 0  |\n| 2-3  | 8  | 3  |\n| 4-6  | 35  | 6  |\n| 7-10  | 92  | 17  |\n\n【33】Table 3 Modified Glasgow criteria and scoring system for acute pancreatitis\n\n| Criteria  | Scoring  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Age (years)  | ≥55=1  |\n| Serum albumin (g/L)  | 零 ≥32=0  |\n| PaO2 on air (mmHg)  | \\>60=0  |\n| Serum calcium (mmol/L)  | ≤2.0=1 ≥2.0=0  |\n| Blood glucose (mmol/L)  | \\>10=1 ≤10=0  |\n| Serum LDH (units/L)  | \\>600=1 ≤600=0  |\n| Blood urea(mmol/L)  | \\>16=1 ≤16=0  |\n| WBC count (mm~)  | \\>15000=1 <15000=0  |\n\n【35】Gallstone pancreatitis is a challenging surgical emergency. Di-agnosis is made by a combination of history， laboratory tests and CECT. Conservative approach is the mainstay of initial man-agement. ERCP is indicated for patients with documented CBD stones on CECT with superimposed cholangitis. Cholecystec-tomy during the index admission is a preferable option.\n\n【36】Funding\n\n【37】This work did not receive any grant from funding agencies in the public， commercial， or not-for-profit sectors.\n\n【38】Conflict of interest\n\n【39】There are no conflicts of interest to declare by any of the authors of this study.\n\n【40】Acknowledgements\n\n【41】I would like to thank Mr. Parth Vagholkar for his help in type-setting the manuscript.\n\n【42】References\n\n【43】1\\.

However， the vast number of conservative methods and variability in treatment combinations， including patient treatment preferences， delay the recovery time and impact patients' recovery rates. The current study presents the methods and outcomes of 15-week self-managed functional rehabilitation training. Case presentation： The patient is a 40-year-old recreational female runner with L4-L5 disc herniation， which occurred after lifting a heavy object three weeks prior. After the initial three weeks of a rehabilitation program， the patient’s pain was reduced from 8/10 to 5/10 on the VAS scale. After 12 weeks of stabilization and a functional program， the patient has regained full functionality with a pain score of 0/10 on the VAS scale. Conclusion： The presented case demonstrates that a self-managed functional rehabilitation exercise program may lead to regression of lumbar disc herniation and full reduction of symptoms after 15 weeks.\n\n【5】KEYWORDS lumbar disc herniation， regression， exercise\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is one of the most frequent causes of low back and radicular leg pain.

However there is no consensus on the most ef-fective conservative treatment for a lumbar disk herniation due to variability in conservative treatments and patient preferences.\n\n【8】Previous studies indicate that most improvements and re-duction of symptoms using conservative treatments may occur syI during the first 3 months after the onset of symptoms \\[3，4\\].

The variability between re-search stems from a lack of standardization in outcome measires and， subsequently， the different combinations of conservative options used in studies \\[2\\].\n\n【12】Therefore， the purpose of this case study was to present the management and outcome of the functional rehabilitation pro-gram of a female patient with clinical and radiological evidence of L4-L5 disk herniation.\n\n【13】Case Report\n\n【14】Patient profile\n\n【15】The patient is a 40-year-old female recreational runner (20-25km per week) with complaints of low back and left leg pain for the previous three weeks. The patient indicated that the pain started after lifting a heavy object at work. The patient identified the left-sided gluteal， hamstring， and anterior shin pain and rated the pain as 8/10 on the visual analogue scale (VAS). The patient indicated that coughing and sitting for longer than 30 minutes aggravated her symptoms while standing， walking， and side-lying with the pillow between the knees provided temporary\n\n【16】relief. The patient has no history of previous surgeries， spinal in-juries， or chronic systemic conditions. She indicated no previous acute back pain or sciatica episodes.\n\n【17】Figure 1 T2-weighted magnetic resonance of the patient’s axial(lower) and sagittal (upper) slices， taken before (left) and after(right) the intervention.\n\n【18】Examination\n\n【19】The patient completed Oswestry Disability Index (OSDI) (Os-westry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire) and scored28/50 points (0 is indicative of full functionality) \\[5\\]. The physi-cal examination found 1) limited and painful forward bending in the standing position (fingertips-to-floor 51 cm， with pain VAS8/10)， 2) increased muscle tone of the back extensors (palpation)，\n\n| Stage 1  | Stage 2  | Stage 3  | Stage 4  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0-3 weeks  | 3-7 weeks  | 7-11 weeks  | 11-15 weeks  |\n| 1\\. sciatic nerve flossingexercises (neural mobilization) in sittingposition 5 times a day， 10 repetitions  | 1\\.

Heel and toe walking was possible， and no other significant postural deviations and sensory deficits were found. Achilles and patel-lar reflexes were normal， as well as the manual muscle test of the lower extremities and trunk. The patient was positive on ipsilateral SLR at 40 degrees and Slump test in a sitting position. MRI of the lumbar spine was performed at the patient’s request and showed a herniated L4/L5 disc with compression of the left L5 root (Figure 1).\n\n【22】Intervention\n\n【23】The rehabilitation program consisted of four stages， 3-4 weeks each， during which the exercises were loaded progressively(more challenging forms) in a way that utilizes isometric contrac-tions， followed by abdominal bracing in prone， quadruped， and front/side plank positions in order to provide spinal stabiliz a-tion (Table 1). Considering this was a self-managed program， all exercises were explained in detail， and the video recordings of the exercises were given to the patient. In addition， the patient was instructed to perform abdominal bracing before every repe-tition to provide spinal stability \\[6\\]. In addition， considering the patient's work required significant sitting， the patient was ad-vised to 1) avoid bed rest as much as possible， 2) stand up after20 minutes of sitting for at least 5 minutes，3) avoid movements that increase distal symptoms such as forward bending， and 4) sleep in the side-lying position in order to ensure a safe healing environment.\n\n【24】Results\n\n【25】Three-week follow-up examination revealed 1) a subjective re-duction of pain (5/10 on VAS)；2)longer steps during walking and better sitting tolerance (i.e. discomfort during sitting ap pears after a longer period than before)；3) SLR was improved to 60 degrees and 4) trunk flexion ROM improved (fingertips-to-floor 22 cm， with pain on VAS 5/10). After a 12-week self-administered exercise program， the patient reported complete resolution of symptoms (VAS0-1/10) with an OSDI score of 4/50points. In addition， clinical examination showed 1) negative SLR\n\n【26】and Slump test； 2) significant improvement in trunk flexion ROM (fingertips-to-floor 5 cm) and symmetrical bilateral stride length during walking (visual observation). Although the pa-tient was fully asymptomatic， she requested a post-intervention MRI， which revealed nearly complete retraction of the protruded L4/L5 disc without disc-radicular conflict (Figure 1). The patient was advised to start running again and continue with stabiliza-tion exercises twice a week.\n\n【27】Discussion and Conclusion\n\n【28】The findings of this study indicate that a comprehensive self-exercise program described in this study， consisting of a com-bination of neural mobilization， McKenzie centralization， and stabilization exercises， produced a significant reduction of the symptoms after 3 weeks and complete functional recovery af-ter a 15-week intervention. Furthermore， considering exercises in this study comprehensively improve nerve gliding， reduce disc-radicular contact， and improve motor control and general functional capacity， as three main mechanisms hypothesized in literature \\[7-11\\] the recovery time in this study was significantly faster than previously reported \\[2\\]. However， it remains unclear at what point of the intervention regression of the protrusion occurred and to what extent the exercises contributed to this. Nevertheless， the primary goal of the intervention was to reduce symptoms and increase the patient's functional capacity.\n\n【29】Funding\n\n【30】This work did not receive any grant from funding agencies in the public， commercial， or not-for-profit sectors.\n\n【31】Conflict of interest\n\n【32】There are no conflicts of interest to declare by any of the authors of this study.\n\n【33】References\n\n【34】1\\.

Although most such cases are asymptomatic， clip migration can result in serious morbidity such as abscess formation and be a source of sepsis years later. This case report highlights the importance of keeping Filshie clip migration as a differential di-agnosis vs. pelvic inflammatory disease in women without oth-er risk factors and who had previously undergone tubal ligation.\n\n【29】Case Report\n\n【30】A 51-year-old woman initially presented to a general district hos-pital emergency department (ED) with 2-week history of wors-ening right-side flank pain， colicky in nature， associated with dysuria， fever， and chills. There was no associated frequency， urgency， or gross hematuria. An X-ray of kidneys， ureters， and bladder (KUB) showed no definite renal calculus， but noted tub-al ligation clips in the pelvis. She was discharged home with a course of antibiotics as treatment for a urinary tract infection and was followed up in urology clinic 10 days later.\n\n【31】On follow-up， her fever and abdominal pain persisted despite completing 10 days of oral antibiotics， and was subsequently admitted to the hospital with the provisional diagnosis of right-side pyelonephritis.\n\n【32】She had 1 normal vaginal delivery 12 years ago， followed by immediate postpartum tubal sterilization with Filshie clips， done within 6 h delivery， which involved a sub-umbilical 3-cm transverse incision on her abdomen. Each tube was ligated with a Filshie clip through the open incision. The incision was then closed in layers. She had no other significant past med-ical or surgical history.\n\n【33】Figure 1. Filshie clip within bladder wall abscess in CT kidneys ureters bladder.\n\n【34】She was febrile on admission， with temperatures above 38.5°℃. On examination， she was normotensive with tenderness over the right lumbar and iliac fossa regions， but with no rebound tenderness or guarding. A speculum examination revealed a normal cervix and vagina. Vaginal examination showed a12-week-sized uterus with fullness in the right adnexa， but no cervical excitation.\n\n【35】A computed tomography (CT) KUB done on admission showed a 4-cm right anterior urinary bladder wall mass with a tub-al ligation clip， suspicious for a tumor with secondary infec tion (Figure 1). There were no urinary calculi and no changes on imaging suggestive of pyelonephritis. Her tumor markers of CEA， CA 125， and LDH were normal. A flexible cystoscopy showed no bladder lesions or cystitis， but noted external com-pression over the anterior bladder wall. Urine cytology showed no malignant cells. A subsequent post-contrast CT urography showed a rim-enhancing mass abutting the anterior bladder wall containing the right tubal ligation clip， suggestive of a right adnexal abscess arising from pelvic inflammatory dis-ease (PID) (Figure 2).\n\n【36】She was then transferred to our hospital (KK Women’s and Children's Hospital O&G Department) for further management of her pelvic inflammatory disease. An ultrasound (US) pelvis confirmed a 5.6x3.6x4.9 cm right tubo-ovarian abscess， on a background of a fibroid uterus. A full infectious diseases screen was done； she was found to be negative for sexually trans-mitted diseases，including chlamydia， gonorrhoea， HI， hepati-tis B， and syphilis. Urine and blood cultures were also negative.\n\n【37】She was started on triple intravenous (IV) antibiotics(Ceftriaxone， Metronidazole， and Gentamicin) and oral dox-ycycline， as treatment for PID. As she continued to spike fe vers of T39℃ despite 4 days of lV antibiotics， an ultra-sound-guided drainage of her right tubo-ovarian abscess was\n\n【38】Figure 2. Filshie clip within bladder wall abscess in CT urography post-contrast.\n\n【39】Figure 3. Dense omental adhesions seen on initial diagnostic laparoscopy.\n\n【40】attempted， but the contents could not be aspirated because the right adnexal collection was mostly solid. A repeat US pel-vis showed an increase in size of the abscess to 7.6 cm 5 days later. Inflammatory markers were also persistently raised. A de-cision was made to perform surgical drainage in view of the failed conservative management.\n\n【41】She initially underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy， which was quickly converted to midline exploratory laparotomy due to presence of dense omental adhesions to the anteriorabdom-inal wall and bladder (Figure 3). A 4-cm right bladder wall ab-scess was seen separately from the right fallopian tube and ovary (Figure 4). Pus was expelled out of the cavity after dis-secting the omentum off the bladder wall abscess. This resulted in an inadvertent bladder dome perforation， which was subse-quently repaired. A Filshie clip was found deep in the bladder wall abscess cavity and removed (Figure 5). The omentum cov-ering the abscess and a urachal remnant were taken for bi-opsy. Her right fallopian tube was also removed for histology， as it appeared inflamed intraoperatively (Figure 6). A surgical drain was left in situ and the abdomen was closed in layers.\n\n【42】Figure 4. A 4-cm anterior bladder wall abscess.\n\n【43】The patient made an uneventful recovery postoperatively， with down-trending inflammatory markers. Her fever and pain also resolved. She was discharged home well on post-op day 4 with an indwelling catheter for 3 weeks. Her surgical drain was re-moved prior to hospital discharge. A micturating cystogram1 month later showed no extravasation of contrast， and the catheter was removed.\n\n【44】Figure 5. Filshie clip seen within bladder wall abscess.\n\n【45】The histology of the omentum and urachal remnant showed acute and chronic inflammation with areas of ulceration and fat necrosis， while that of the right fallopian tube showed se-rosal acute-on-chronic inflammation and surface ulceration. No malignancy was seen in any of the 3 tissues.\n\n【46】Discussion\n\n【47】Tubal ligation with Filshie clips is a common sterilization meth-od among women who have completed families and has been in use since 1981 \\[1\\]. It has a relatively low failure rate of0.5%\\[2\\]. It is a 12.7x4 mm titanium clip with silicone rubber jaw lining. It works by initially causing tubal avascular necro-sis， which then leads to 2 healed occluded stumps. In most cases， the clip becomes peritonealized and remains in situ.\n\n【48】However， it is thought that slow peritonealization creates a chance for migration of Filshie clips \\[3\\]. Most cases remain un-detected， without any significant morbidity. Filshie estimates that up to 25% of Filshie clips migrate with time， but stay mainly within the peritoneum， without causing symptoms \\[4\\].\n\n【49】Rarely， Filshie clips have been noted to migrate across tissue planes， with an incidence rate estimated at 0.6 per 1000 wom-en by the US FDA in 1996 \\[5\\]. Abscess formation， fistulation， and adhesion formation were some of the common compli-cations arising from clip migration to other tissue sites， as re-ported by most studies， and the time to presentation varied from 6 weeks to more than 20 years following tubal ligation \\[6\\].\n\n【50】To date， there are more than 24 case reports of Filshie clip migration to various sites of the pelvis， including the blad-der \\[6\\]， anterior abdominal wall \\[7\\]， peritoneal cavity \\[8\\]， co-lon \\[9\\]， vagina \\[10\\]， perianal region \\[11\\]， and groin \\[12\\]， most of which required surgical removal， especially in cases of ab-scesses. The urinary bladder is one of the most common sites of migration， with 5 other cases reported to date. Three cases\n\n【51】Figure 6.Inflamed-looking right fallopian tube posterior to bladder wall abscess.\n\n【52】had spontaneous urethral expulsion of the Filshie clip \\[13-15\\]， while the other 2 required surgical removal \\[6\\].\n\n【53】The mechanism of clip migration is still not well understood， given normal pelvic anatomy at the time of sterilization. It has been postulated that the Filshie clip， despite being made from an inert material， induces a low-grade inflammatory response within the peritoneum， with subsequent adhesion formation， allowing its eventual erosion into the bladder wall \\[13\\]. This is also supported by early studies in primates， showing that Filshie clips can induce a foreign body inflammatory response \\[17\\]， and this is clinically evident in the increased risk of ectopic pregnancy after tubal sterilization due to tissue reaction \\[2\\].\n\n【54】The present report adds to the small but growing literature showing that clip migration is a rare but significant late com-plication following sterilization. It may mimic a bladder wall ab-scess or a tubo-ovarian abscess， as in our case. Women should be adequately counselled about the early and late risks of this popular method of female sterilization， especially with the de-layed symptomatic presentation of clip migration years later.\n\n【55】Conclusions\n\n【56】In conclusion， Filshie clip migration should be considered as a source of sepsis in the differential diagnosis of pelvic pain and fever in women with a history of tubal ligation. Women should be counselled regarding the significant risk of clip mi-gration (up to 25%)， although most remain asymptomatic. They should also be made aware of the potential rare late compli-cation of clip migration across tissues and its serious morbid-ity such as abscess formation， which can occur years later.\n\n【57】We would like to thank Dr Felicia Hong， Urology Consultant from Tan Tock Seng Hospital Singapore， for her assistance in bladder repair intraoperatively.

It leads to devastating neurologic outcomes， and most patients do not recover completely. The clinical presentation is diverse and includes a severe acute attack， radiating pain at the back， interscapular， or neurological deficits. We report a case of a young woman， 24-year-old， that was admitted to our department for sudden non-traumatic cervical spinal cord compression syndrome (Type A of the American Spinal Cord Injury Association \"ASIA A\")， including intense cervical back pain， sensory loss， and tetraplegia. Her past medical history was unremarkable. The MRI confirmed a cervical mass responsible for the spinal cord compression， and the emergent surgical intervention allowed us to evacuate acute C3-C7hematoma. Unfortunately， the patient never recovers from the neurologic deficit despite the emergent management of her case followed by functional musculoskeletal rehabilitation for two years.\n\n【5】KEYWORDS Spinal Cord Compression， Hematoma， Epidural， Spinal， Cervical Vertebrae， case report\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Spontaneous spinal epidural hematomas are the idiopathic ac-cumulation of blood within the spinal canal's epidural space， causing symptoms varying from general back pain to complete paraplegia \\[1\\]. It is a very rare cause of acute spinal cord com-pression and is estimated to occur every year in approximately0.1% of 100，000 individuals \\[2\\]. MRI is the radiological investi-gation of choice. Fifty percent of spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma patients do not fully recover， and 30% of patients pre-sented with ASIA A classification did not improve with surgery\\[3\\].

The patient denies neck trauma， and her past medical history was unremarkable. The physical examination revealed super-ficial and deep sensory palsy with the sensibility level at C4. The osteotendinous reflexes were abolished in all 4 limbs and acute urinary retention. There was no fever， and the patient was in general good health status. This cervical spinal cord com-pression is classified as ASIA A (Table 1). The cervical MRI performed in emergency showed a posterolateral right epidu-ral masse that is heterogeneous in T1-weighted， hypointense in T2-weighted， and compressing the dural sheath from the 3rd to the 7th cervical vertebrae (Fig. 1). These findings were sug-gestive of an epidural tumour lesion. The patient underwent surgical decompression the same day. Patient under general anaesthesia and in a supine position， we did laminectomy at C4-C5-C6 and got directly on a bunch of clotted blood in direct contact with dura sheath. This large extradural hematoma was\n\n| A Complete  | No motor or sensory function is preserved in the sacral segments S4-S5.  |\n| --- | --- |\n| B Incomplete  | Sensory function preserved but not motor function is preserved below the neurologicallevel and includes the sacral segments S4-S5.  |\n| CIncomplete  | Motor function is preserved below the neurological level， and more than half of keymuscles below the neurological level have a muscle grade less than 3.  |\n| D Incomplete  | Motor function is preserved below the neurological level， and at least half of key musclesbelow the neurological level have a muscle grade of 3 or more.  |\n| E Normal  | Motor and sensory function are normal.  |\n\n【18】Figure 1： Fig 1： T1-weighted MRI of the cervical spine showing hyperintense epidural fluid collection； identified posterior to the cord in semilunar shape on A/axial view and B/sagittal view， at the C4-C7 levels measuring up to 2 cm thick.

A subsequent search for a hemorrhagic defect proved was unsuccessful.\n\n【20】A detailed rehabilitation schedule was established for the early rehabilitation program， which included a passive joint range of motion training of lower limbs， active joint range of motion training of upper limbs， muscle strength enhances train-ing， pulmonary function training， and position change training. In spite of intense postoperative rehabilitation， the patient re-mained at grade ASIA A classification with severe sequelae after2 vears.\n\n【21】Discussion\n\n【22】Taking the patient directly from ICU to the OR for emergency cervical decompression by laminectomy of C4-C5-C6 for sponta-neous cervical hematoma revealed by sudden tetraplegia is the best medical decision to manage this kind of patient hope that the patient will recover from the nervous assault after surgery.\n\n【23】Nevertheless， that was just a hope that may or may not be all the patient's reality even though it happened to be the same case. MRI is the gold standard radiological investigation for patients presenting with signs and symptoms of spinal cord injury. In most findings， the spontaneous cervical hematoma was of high intensity or heterogeneous in T1-weighted and low intensity in T2-weighted \\[4-6\\]. Different theories have supported that the internal epidural plexus is responsible for bleeding into the epidural space. This may explain the heterogeneity of the le-sion on T1-weighted for the mixture of old blood clots and the persistent venous bleeding.\n\n【24】Patients who present with more severe symptoms within a shorter time frame tend to have larger hematomas； these are associated with worse outcomes， particularly when four or more spinal segments are involved \\[7-9\\]. Moreover， these were the same findings of our reported case. On the other hand， a liter-ature review by Figueroa et DeVine (10) has shown that some individuals presenting with an ASIA A deficit have demon-strated recovery. So， the decision of surgery for spontaneous spinal hematoma must not depend on the heaviness of the neu-rological deficit nor on time wasted by the patient before seeking medical care； for the simple reason that some of these patients do recover after surgery. Many authors reported surgical manage-ment by decompressive laminectomy and hematoma evacuation\\[4，5，11，12\\].However， the results were quite diverse and different from one patient to another， even if they had the same clinical presentation.\n\n【25】Nevertheless， Hongo et al. \\[13\\] performed hematoma re-moval and decompression by corpectomy from the front of C3-C5 at approximately 32 h after the onset of symptoms. The patient could stand and walk 3 days after the operation without fixation. It may be possible that the extent of recovery does not depend only on the heaviness of the nervous palsy prior to surgery but also on the surgical technique used for the de-compression of the dural sheath， nerves， and nerve roots. Pa-tients with minimal symptoms prior to therapy are more likely to acquire complete recovery than those with major deficits in sensorimotor functioning. A hallmark prognostic indicator of pretherapy neural deficits is the ASIA score. Baeesa et al. \\[14\\] reported significant recovery with conservative therapy for se-lected patients with a mild to moderate neurological deficit who demonstrated early neurological improvement. Kim et al. \\[15\\] concluded that conservative therapy could be feasible for se-lected patients with an ASIA score of C，D， or E demonstrating spontaneous early neurological recovery. At the same time， the ASIA A or B patients should undergo emergent decompressive surgery. However， decompressive laminectomy should remain readily available， given the inverse correlation between the op-erative interval and better recovery.\n\n【26】Conclusion\n\n【27】Urgent surgical decompression is the treatment of choice for spontaneous cervical epidural hematoma with a neurological deficit.

Despite some reports of spontaneous recovery most of these patients are treated surgically as a spontaneous aortic dissection， especially if there is a compli-cation of the aortic lesion.\n\n【29】Case Report：\n\n【30】A 52-year-old white female was submitted to an angioplasty in the right coronary without success and the procedure was complicated by a dissection in aortic root with progressive extension to the ascending aorta. This lesion deformed the aortic valve， leaving it with an acute moderate regurgitation. Because of current use of clopidogrel and clinical stability of the patient， the local Heart Team decided to withdrawn this antiplatelet for 5 days before surgery despite the risk related to the aortic syndrome. A new echocardiogram 3 days later showed that the hematoma was reabsorbed with improvement of the aortic insufficiency. An angiotomogra-phy confirmed the reabsorption of the hematoma. The surgery was canceled and the patient was maintained in a conservative treatment and discharged. Seventeen months later， she was re-evaluated and was still as-ymptomatic without aortic regurgitation in the echocardiogram and showing progressive regression of the aor-tic hematoma in the tomography.\n\n【31】Conclusions：\n\n【32】Despite the conservative treatment， this case of iatrogenic aortic dissection complicated by an acute aortic re-gurgitation had a good evolution in a follow-up of 17 months.\n\n【33】MeSH Keywords： Aorta · Dissection· Echocardiography\n\n【34】Full-text PDF http：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/891301\n\n【35】Dissection of the ascending aorta is a life-threatening condi-tion and despite notable advances in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)， there are rare cases of aortic dissection due to PCI (about 0.07%)\\[1\\]， especially in the myocardial infarc-tion scenario (0.19%)\\[2\\].\n\n【36】There are few cases of cardiac-catheter-induced aortic dis section reported in detail in the literature to date. Treatment options include urgent surgical intervention， placement of an intracoronary stent at the origin of the culprit vessel， or con-servative therapy. Considering the small number of cases de-scribed in the literature to date， there is a lack of data to de-fine consistent recommendations for management of this complication. Despite some favorable results of conservative approach，the current limited data suggest that surgical man-agement may be indicated in cases of post-PCI ascending aor-tic dissection， especially if there is any complication related to the aortic lesion， like an acute aortic regurgitation \\[1-12\\]. Patients with limited dissections and successful stenting of the coronary dissection may not require surgery， but the very rare cases of extensive dissection with secondary complica-tions are routinely treated by surgery. A good evolution after a conservative management in this scenario of acute aortic re-gurgitation due to aortic dissection is unexpected.\n\n【37】Case Report\n\n【38】A 52-year-old white female， with history of hypertension， dys-lipidemia， and hypothyroidism， was hospitalized on 21 August2012 due to non-st elevation acute coronary syndrome. This patient did not have a history of smoking， alcohol abuse， or use of illegal drugs. She underwent coronary angiography on the same day and a severe stenosis in the ostium of the\n\n【39】right coronary was detected， but this vessel received distally a rich collateral circulation. Considering this lesion the cause of the symptoms， on 23 August it was decided to perform a percutaneous treatment of the diseased artery. The inter-vention was not successful and was complicated by an aor-tic root dissection with progressive intramural hematoma of the ascending aorta (Figure 1). The patient was then referred to our service on 24 August and transferred to the ICU， be-ing assessed by the cardiac surgery team， which initially re-quested a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE).\n\n【40】The first TEE showed aortic wall thickening with maximum thickness of 3 cm， limited to the posterior-lateral， with a grow-ing characteristic aspect， affecting the right coronary cusp of the aortic valve and extending about 4 cm from the ascend-ing aorta (Figure 2). No typical blade signs of rupture or dis-section were detected. The valve presented moderate regur-gitation secondary to an alteration of cooptation (Figure 2). Both aortic the arch and descending aorta were normal and no signs of pericardial effusion were detected. Initially， sur-gical treatment was suggested， probably Bentall de Bonno， considering the persistence of the tear site at the right coro-nary ostium， the extension up the ascending aorta， and the presence of acute aortic regurgitation.\n\n【41】Due to the recent use of clopidogrel and clinical stability of the patient after blood pressure and heart rate control， the inter-vention was postponed by a further 5 days， even considering this approach controversial in this clinical scenario.\n\n【42】During her stay in the ICU for the “washout\" of clopidogrel， the patient remained hemodynamically stable， Glasgow coma scale of 15， with occasional mild chest pain without any clin-ical repercussion， comfortable respiration， with O2catheters， full and symmetrical pulses in all 4 limbs； intravenous nitro-glycerine in low doses and， prophylactic enoxaparin.\n\n【43】Figure 2. TEE cross-section of the aorta wall with arrows showing hematoma in the ascending aorta (A). (B) image shows the presence of aortic valve regurgitation by color Doppler.\n\n【44】Figure 3. (A) image in the cross section of the aorta showing a good opening of 3 leaflets of the aortic valve. (B) image showing ascending aortic with wall thickening only， not showing gross hematoma seen in the previous examination. (C) image showing left ventricle outflow with a trivial reflux of the aortic valve.\n\n【45】Thus， the case was discussed with staff， and the surgery was can-celed， and it clinical conservative management was chosen instead.\n\n【46】During the follow-up in the ward， on 30 August a CT angiog-raphy was done， in which the presence of a small mural he-matoma in the ascending aorta could be seen from the valve plane， preferentially located in the lateral right aorta， with a thickness of 7 mm and a slight pericardial effusion (Figure 4).\n\n【47】Because of her satisfactory clinical evolution， on 27 August the transesophageal echocardiogram (pre-surgical) was repeat-ed for a bettertreatment definition. We noted the absence of any suggestive image of dissection and/or significant hema-toma in the proximal ascending aorta； there was only a thick-ening of the aortic wall (Figure 3). Also with the improvement in the competence of the aortic valve， only a trivial reflux was shown (Figure 3).\n\n【48】Having a significant resorption of the hematoma in the ascend-ing aorta， taking into account the patient’s good clinical evo-lution， and because the coronary artery receives a rich collat-eral network， the patient was discharged from hospital， with the recommendation of rest for 2 weeks and outpatient treat-ment. After 17 months， the patient did not have any relevant clinical event and imaging showed almost complete regression of the hematoma and no aortic regurgitation (Figures 5 and 6).\n\n【49】Figure 4. (A) image shows a small hematoma to the right side of the aorta. (B) image shows mild pericardial effusion.\n\n【50】TOTALCOR\n\n【51】Figure 5. (A， B) CT performed 17 months after the event showing regression of the thickening of the aorta wall and no pericardial effusion.\n\n【52】Acute aortic syndrome is the modern term that includes aortic dissection (AD)， intramural hematoma (IMH)， and symptom-atic aortic ulcer \\[13，14\\]. latrogenic coronary artery dissection extending to the coronary sinuses during percutaneous cor-onary intervention occurs in less than 0.1% of cases \\[15，16\\]. In diagnostic imaging， it may appears as crescent-shaped or circumferential thickening around the aortic wall， and not as true and false lumens separated by an intimal “flap”， mak-ing the diagnosis between AD or IMH more difficult \\[14-16\\].\n\n【53】Stanford classification， very commonly used to aortic dissec-tion， may be useful for aortic hematoma because both diseas-es have similar prognosis and therapeutic implications \\[13-19\\]. The lesions involving the ascending aorta are classified as type A， and the ones not present in the ascending aorta， as type B.\n\n【54】The proximal hematoma involving the ascending aorta ap-pears to be an important predictor for early progression and death \\[13-18\\]， representing a high risk of a non-surgical man-agement of type A aortic syndromes. Among cases of post-PCI aortic dissections， the overall mortality seems to be a lit-tle lower than in spontaneous lesions， but the risk increases as complications occur.\n\n【55】Figure 6. (A， B) Echocardiogram performed 17 months after the event， without signs of aortic valve insufficiency\n\n【56】Like the current case report， more than 80% of the reported cases have involved the right coronary artery as the culprit vessel \\[15，20\\]. It is possible that the larger ostium of the left main coronary artery may decrease the incidence of catheter-induced trauma to this vessel. The risk of this complication is higher in cases of extensive coronary disease (e.g.， heavily cal-cified vessels or total occlusions) because these procedures usually require a more aggressive manipulation of catheters in vessels whose walls are less resistant to trauma. Despite some abnormalities in the wall of the aorta of cases of cathe-ter-related dissection， the situation is different in patients who had spontaneous aortic dissection， who almost always have significant degeneration of the media， facilitating the propa-gation of the dissection \\[19\\]. The literature shows that iatro-genic aortic dissections have fewer complications than spon-taneous disease \\[21\\].\n\n【57】Considering the differences between spontaneous and cardi-ac-catheter-related dissection of the ascending aorta in terms of pathophysiology and prognosis， the treatment management recommended may also have some unique aspects. The en-try site also has therapeutic implications because a coronary-based dissection may be effectively sealed by stenting within minutes of this complication， limiting the potential for further propagation. Careful surveillance with optimal blood pressure contro. and appropriate imaging could be used to ensure sta-bility and healing of the dissection. Serial transesophageal echocardiography studies certainly showed this in our patient.\n\n【58】References：\n\n【59】1\\.

However， our case had a major complication， which was a clinically-relevant acute aortic regurgitation. This situation was considered potentially catastrophic if no surgery was performed， considering similar situations \\[23\\]. Based on this assumption， we chose to perform a surgical intervention； however， surprisingly， the lesion reverted in the following days and improved in the control exams after 17-month follow-up.\n\n【63】Conclusions\n\n【64】This unexpected effect of conservative treatment reveals the importance of establishing predictive factors for the evolution of iatrogenic aortic syndromes， aiming to make the best treat-ment decision for these rare and unpredictable cases.\n\n【65】Disclosures\n\n【66】I hereby declare that there are no potential or relevant con-flicts of interest of any of the authors.\n\n【67】Acknowledgments\n\n【68】Amil Clinical Research.\n\n【69】3\\.

It often associates with high serum ferritin levels\n\n【26】Case Report：\n\n【27】An 88-year-old woman had fever of over 39°C without response to extended-spectrum antibiotics for 6 days. She had non-specific erythema with infiltration on her trunk. She had leukocytosis with neutrophilia of 80%， mild hepatic dysfunction， normal level of rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody， thrombocytopenia， elevat-ed d-dimer and soluble interleukin2 receptor， extremely high serum ferritin (78 662 ng/mL)， and splenomegaly. Although she had no arthritis or specific erythema， we made the diagnosis of AOSD according to Yamaguchi's criteria with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) after ruling out infections， malignancies， or other connective tissue diseases. Twe lve percent of AOSD patients have HPS. The mean serum ferritin of AOSD with HPS was reported at 18 179 ng/mL， which supported the diagnosis of AOSD because only a few other diseases could show such extremely high serum ferritin. Although she was treated with prednisolone (30 mg/day)， her condition deteriorated and her left pleural effusion increased. Therefore， methylprednisolone 500 mg/day for 3 days was started followed by prednisolone 30 mg/day and immunosup-pressive agent (Cyclosporine 50 mg/day)， which improved her general condition， elevated C-reactive protein\n\n【28】levels， and extremely high serum ferritin levels.\n\n【29】Conclusions：\n\n【30】We report the case of an elderly patient with severe AOSD， who developed HPS and DIC， whose extremely high serum ferritin level was useful in diagnosis.\n\n【31】MeSH Keywords：\n\n【32】Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation· Ferritins ·Lymphohistiocytosis， Hemophagocytic·Still's Disease， Adult-Onset\n\n【33】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/905684\n\n【34】口22013 盟1 山可甘3 28\n\n【35】Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is a rare multi-systemic in-flammatory disorder of unknown etiology characterized by spiking fever， characteristic rash， and arthritis \\[1，2\\]. It often is associated with high serum ferritin levels. The annual inci-dence rate is 0.22 to 0.34 per 100 000 people in Japan， and it is more common in women than in men \\[1，3\\]. The typical rash of AOSD is salmon maculopapular erythema， which dis-appears with defervescence \\[4\\]. It is predominantly found on the proximal limbs and trunk \\[1\\]. However， various atypical rashes have been reported in some case studies of AOSD \\[5\\]. Moreover， there are some reports of AOSD without arthri-tis \\[6\\]. The diagnosis of atypical AOSD can be extremely dif-ficult because of its non-specific serological and pathological findings in common with many other diseases， including in-fections， malignancies，and other connective tissue diseases， which should be excluded \\[1，5，7.\n\n【36】Twelve percent of AOSD patients have hemophagocytic syn-drome (HPS) \\[8，9\\]. HPS is the condition caused by hypercyto-kinemia following genetic disorders with immunodeficiency， infections， malignancies， or other connective tissue diseases. The most frequent etiology of HPS of all connective tissue dis-eases is AOSD \\[8\\]. HPS can be diagnosed according to criteria including fever， splenomegaly， hepatic dysfunction， high se-rum ferritin level， high soluble interleukin-2 receptor， hypofi-brinogenemia， and hyponatremia， even without the diagnos-tic findings of bone marrow \\[10\\].\n\n【37】We here report the case of an elderly woman with severe AOSD with HPS. Her extremely high serum ferritin level was a use-ful diagnostic clue in the absence of major symptoms， which made the diagnosis extremely difficult.\n\n【38】An 88-year-old Japanese woman， who was independent in her daily activities with no drinking history， had high fever. In March2016， she had a fever over 38C for 6 days without response to extended-spectrum antibiotics. On the sixth day of illness， she was transferred to our hospital because of her very low blood platelet count of 15x10/pL On admission， her body tempera-ture was 38.6℃ heart rate was 88 beats/min， blood pressure was 166/77 mmHg， respiratory rate was 16/min， and oxygen saturation was 97% on room air. Arthritis was not present in any of her joints. On the second hospital day， she had erythe-ma annulare at the inner parts of both lower thighs， an edem-atous erythema on her back， and a granular-sized infiltrative erythema on the right knee (Figure 1). Her atypical erythema repeatedly appeared and disappeared regardless of the pattern of fever. Laboratory findings on admission are shown in Table 1. The patient had leukocytosis of 13.7×10\\*/pL with neutrophilia of 87.3%， aspartate aminotransferase 484 IU/L， alanine amino-transferase 96 IU/L， C-reactive protein (CRP) 10.4 mg/dl， procal-citonin 0.85 ng/mL， and an extremely high serum ferritin levels of 78 662 ng/mL. In addition， she was diagnosed with compli-cation of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) scoring6 on the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (JAAM) DIC scoring system (thrombopenia of 21 000/pL and elevated d-di-mer levels of 20.1 pg/mL) \\[11\\]. Rheumatoid factor， antinuclear antibody， several viral antibody titers， such as cytomegalovirus， Epstein-Barr virus， hepatitis B virus， hepatitis C virus and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1， tuberculosis-specific interferon-gam-ma release assay， and blood cultures were negative. An ultra-sound cardiogram revealed normal findings without vegetation on any heart valve. Bone marrow biopsy， skin biopsy of a sin-gle spot， and subsequent random skin biopsies were performed to rule out intravascular lymphoma. Bone marrow biopsy failed to show hemophagocytosis， and flow cytometry did not show any abnormalities， which allowed us to rule out myelodysplastic syndrome and aplastic anemia. Esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy was performed to exclude gastrointestinal malignancies， which\n\n【39】AB C\n\n【40】Figure 1. Rash on the second hospital day.

Contrast-enhanced chest computed to-mography revealed ground-glass opacity， small amounts of bi-lateral pleural effusions， and splenomegaly without lymphade-nopathy. The imaging studies and laboratory data did not show the presence of liver cirrhosis， vira. hepatitis， or autoimmune hepatitis. Even though it was extremely difficult to rule out the presence of infection， malignancy，and other connective tissue disease completely at this point， AOSD was strongly suspected according to the Yamaguchi criteria (fever over 39℃ for more than a week， leukocytosis with neutrophilia of 80%， splenomeg-aly， hepatic dysfunction， and normal level of rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody) \\[7\\]. Her condition and results of ex-aminations did not meet the diagnostic criteria of any other con-nective tissue diseases. We started treatment with the recom-mended dose of prednisolone of 30 mg/day (0.85 mg/kg/day) because her condition had deteriorated on the second hospital day \\[1\\]. Minocycline 200 mg/day was administered concurrently in case her skin lesions were caused by rickettsia. However， her body temperature increased above 38℃， and serum ferritin level and CRP remained high. Deterioration of her condition despite\n\n【44】the treatment with minocycline made the diagnosis of rickett-sia diseases unlikely. On the sixth hospital day， we performed thoracentesis because her left pleural effusion was increasing. The appearance of the pleural effusion was yellow and cloudy， and laboratory testing showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 8 000/pL (neutrophils 94.6%， lymphocytes 2.4%)， glucose171 mg/dL， and pH 7.34. From these findings， the pleural effu-sion was classified as exudative according to Light criteria (ra-tio of pleural fluid and serum protein levels >0.5， ratio of pleu-ral fluid and serum lactate dehydrogenase levels >0.6)， but not compatible with empyema according to parapneumonic effu-sions criteria (moderate free-flowing effusion， negative culture and gram stain of pleural fluid， pH of pleural fluid >7.20). The negative finding of pleural fluid culture， which ruled out bac-terial pleurisy， confirmed the diagnosis of AOSD. Additionally， a complication of HPS including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocy-tosis (HLH) was diagnosed based on HPS/HLH-2009 diagnostic criteria \\[fever， splenomegaly， hepatic dysfunction， serum ferritin level 78 662 ng/mL (2500 ng/mL)， soluble interleukin-2 recep-tor 4 140 U/mL (>2 400 U/mL)， hypofibrinogenemia 120 mg/dL\n\n【45】Figure 2. Clinical course. We started prednisolone 30 mg/day (0.85 mg/kg/day) because her condition deteriorated on the second hospital day. Minocycline 200 mg/day was administered concurrently in case her skin lesions were caused by rickettsia. On the 20h hospital day， we started methylprednisolone 500 mg/day for 3 days followed by prednisolone 30 mg/day， and cyclosporine 50 mg/day when we made the diagnosis of adult-onset Still’s disease with hemophagocytic syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation after ruling out infections， malignancies， or other connective tissue diseases，which improved her general condition， elevated C-reactive protein levels， and extremely high serum ferritin levels. CRP -c-reactive protein； PSL -prednisolone； mPSL- methylprednisolone； Cys- cyclosporine； MINO- minocycline.\n\n【46】(<150 mg/dL)， and hyponatremia 129 mEq/L \\[10\\]. On the 20h hospital day， we started giving methylprednisolone 500 mg/day for 3 days， with which her fever came down， followed by pred-nisolone 30 mg/day， and cyclosporine 50 mg/day， after making the diagnosis of AOSD with HPS and DIC and ruling out infec-tions， malignancies， and other connective tissue diseases. After her symptoms， including fever and intermittent rash， general condition， elevated CRP levels， and extremely high serum ferri-tin levels had improved， we tapered the dose of prednisolone to 22.5 mg/day and increased the dose of cyclosporine to 200mg/day. On the 79h hospital day， she was transferred to anoth-er hospital (Figure 2) for further recuperation.\n\n【47】The objective of this case report is show that extremely high serum ferritin level can be a useful diagnostic clue of AOSD complicated with HPS and DIC， even in very old patients.\n\n【48】Discussion\n\n【49】It was difficult to diagnose AOSD in this patient because of the lack of typical symptoms and signs and due to her ex-ceptional old age. Infection， malignancy， and connective tis-sue disease should be excluded to accurately diagnose AOSD.\n\n【50】The triad of AOSD is spiking fever， salmon-pink rash， and ar-thritis. According to a previous report in which 90 Japanese AOSD cases were analyzed， the incidence rates of spiking fe-ver， rash， and arthritis were over 97%，87% of which were typ-ical salmon-pink rash appearing with fever and disappearing with defervescence \\[2\\]. Therefore， making a diagnosis of atyp-ical AOSD as with our case， without arthritis or typical rash， could be extremely difficult because of its rarity. AOSD accounts for 4% of etiologies of fever of unknown origin， which is the most frequent condition (approximately 25%) among connec-tive tissue disease-related disorders \\[4\\]. AOSD is a disease of rather younger patients， with mean age at onset of 36 years， with 2 peaks of distribution at 15-25 and 36-45 years \\[12，13\\]. However， patients over 70 years old have been reported， with the oldest patient being 83 years old \\[14-16\\]. At 88 years of age， our case is the oldest ever reported， which made the di-agnosis still more difficult. However， an increase in AOSD in very elderly people is predicted with the unprecedented aging of the population in Japan.\n\n【51】Extremely high serum ferritin level was one of the characteris-tics in our patient. Eighty percent of AOSD patients were report-ed to have increased ferritin levels， 70% of which were more than five times the normal upper limit \\[2\\]. Although different\n\n【52】Figure 3. Ferritin levels. Suspected diagnosis varies according to the level of serum ferritin. Serum ferritin levels over 1 000 ng/mL suggest 3 possible diagnoses -liver diseases， infections， and malignancies - some of which exhibit ferritin levels over 3 000 ng/mL. The median level of serum ferritin in adult-onset Still's disease(AOSD) patients is reportedly 4 752 ng/mL. Extremely high serum ferritin levels >10 000 ng/mL are seen only in severe liver damage， multiple blood transfusions，or hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS). Our patient had an extremely high serum ferritin level of 78 662 ng/mL， which is markedly higher than the mean serum ferritin level of 18 179 ng/mL in AOSD patients with HPS.\n\n【53】levels of serum ferritin denoted the various possibilities of di-agnoses (Figure 3)， a serum ferritin level above that was report-ed to be a strong indicator of AOSD \\[2，17\\]. However， patients with liver diseases such as Gaucher disease or hemochromato-sis， infectious diseases such as HIV， or some malignancies some-times have ferritin >1 000 ng/mL \\[18\\]， with the minority being>3 000 ng/mL\\[19\\]. Because the median level of serum ferritin in AOSD patients was reportedly 4 752 ng/mL \\[18\\]， mildly elevat-ed serum ferritin levels from 1 000 to 3 000 ng/mL might not be so specific to AOSD. However， extremely high serum ferritin lev-els over 10 000 ng/mL were shown only in severe liver damage， multiple blood transfusions， or HPS \\[19，20\\]. Additionally， 12% of AOSD patients were reported to have HPS \\[8，9\\] with a mean se-rum ferritin level of 18 179 ng/mL \\[21\\]. There was another re-port asserting that patients with AOSD with leukopenia and/or thrombocytopenia and DIC could be diagnosed as being compli-cated with HPS \\[21\\]. Because our patient had extremely high se-rum ferritin level and DIC without blood transfusion or severe liv-er dysfunction， she was considered to be complicated with HPS.\n\n【54】Various atypical rashes in AOSD have been reported， such as disseminated erythematous papular， verrucous plaques with vasculitic features， persistent papular characterized by non-caseating dermal granulomas， or peau d'orange-like skin in-filtration due to cutaneous mucinosis， although Yamaguchi's criteria includes only typical salmon-pink rash \\[5，22-24\\].Our patient had only atypical rashes without the typical salmon-pink rash， which was a confusing aspect. Because only 23\n\n【55】cases of AOSD with atypical rash had been reported in the past five years \\[25\\]， it is extremely difficult to diagnose AOSD correctly in such a patient. There is a report of a patient who died from delayed diagnosis because of the absence of typi-cal salmon-pink rash \\[25\\]. It is therefore imperative not to ex-clude AOSD as a diagnosis only based on the absence of typ-ical rash. Although a study analyzing 90 AOSD cases in Japan showed that all of their patients had arthritis \\[2\\]， there was another study in which only 70% of cases had arthritis at di-agnosis \\[6\\]. Moreover， arthritis may be mild and temporary at the early stage of the disease， and develop into severe poly-arthritis within several months after onset \\[1，26\\]. It is there-fore also important not to exclude AOSD as a diagnosis merely based on absence of arthritis at the early stage of the disease.\n\n【56】Corticosteroids are usually used to treat AOSD， and the rec-ommended initial dose of prednisolone ranges from 0.5 to1.0 mg/kg/day \\[1，27\\]. The overall response rate of AOSD to cor-ticosteroid treatments is over 60%，and 78% of patients with se-vere systemic complications such as DIC or HPS as in our case reportedly respond well \\[27\\]. Although our patient’s serum ferri-tin levels decreased after starting prednisolone 0.85 mg/kg/day(30 mg/day)， her systemic condition worsened with the occur-rence of pleuritis. About 55% of HPS cases were reported to be resistant to initial doses of corticosteroids \\[9\\]， and some research-ers insist that AOSD patients with life-threatening complications such as DIC or acute respiratory distress syndrome should be treated with methylprednisolone pulse therapy \\[28\\]. We used only 500 mg/day of methylprednisolone for 3 days， so-called half pulse therapy， because of her extreme old age， followed by oral prednisolone and cyclosporine， which was very successful.\n\n【57】Conclusions\n\n【58】We here reported the oldest women with AOSD ever reported， whose extremely high serum ferritin helped diagnose AOSD without typical rash or arthritis. Serum ferritin level higher than 10 000 ng/mL can be a rather specific marker of AOSD if severe liver dysfunction and history of multiple blood transfu-sions are denied， but serum ferritin level itself is only a non-specific marker of inflammation.\n\n【59】Thus， physicians can use extremely high serum ferritin to make the diagnosis of AOSD， especially when the major symptoms such as arthritis and typical rash are absent， response to the recommended dose of steroid therapy is not sufficient， or it is difficult to make the definite diagnosis of AOSD.\n\n【60】Conflict of interest\n\n【61】1\\.

She was hemodynam-ically normal with serum hemoglobin of 136 and a quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) level of 12，400. She had mild lower abdominal tenderness to deep palpation. No biman-ual examination was performed. She was discharged for review in the early pregnancy clinic the next day.\n\n【7】In clinic her transvaginal ultrasound demonstrated a hem-orrhagic right ovarian cyst and small volume of free fluid. It could not identify an intrauterine gestational sac. A subsequent abdominal ultrasound demonstrated a 22x8x9mm ovoid ane-choic cystic lesion in the inferior pole of the spleen suspicious ror a SEP.\n\n【8】The general surgical team consulted and performed a di-agnostic laparoscopy. We evacuated approximately 500mls of haemoperitoneum and excised a 20mm vascular lesion across the inferior pole of the spleen， presumed to be the EP. Haemosta-sis to the splenic bed was achieved with diathermy. The gyne cology team followed with a right ovarian cystectomy.\n\n【9】Copyright @ 2020 by the Bulgarian Association of Young Surgeons\n\n【10】DOI：10.5455/IJMRCR.splenic-ectopic-pregnancies-treatmient\n\n【11】First Received： April 07， 2020\n\n【12】Accepted： May 01，2020Associate Editor： Ivan Inkov (BG)；\n\n【13】Associate Lecturer University of Queensland， St Lucia， Queensland； Email：kageen@gmail.com\n\n【14】Figure 1： Coronal CT showing fetal sac at the inferior pole of the spleen.\n\n【15】The serum hCG level rose to 15107 the following day.

Four patients were nulliparous on presenta-tion \\[2-5\\]. A majority (53.8%) presented with acute abdominal pain and hypotension (systolic under 100mmHg). An increasing number of patients have presented early with mild pain and normal haemodynamic status. One patient in 2016 was entirely asymptomatic \\[6\\]. A majority of cases reported amenorrhea， with mean of 46 days duration.\n\n【24】Examination commonly revealed generalized abdominal ten-derness， with or without rebound. Many patients experienced tenderness in the left upper or lower abdomen. Bimanual exam-ination did not aid diagnosis. hCG levels ranged from 1865 \\[7\\] to 119，027 \\[4\\] and was not associated with location.\n\n【25】Twenty patients had a preoperative transvaginal ultrasound demonstrating no intrauterine pregnancy. Four patients were incorrectly identified to have tubal EPs \\[8-11J. Ten patients had a preoperative abdominal ultrasound： seven confirmed SEPs\\[4，12-17\\]， and three were inconclusive \\[3，18-19\\]. Five patients had preoperative cross sectional imaging to confirm pregnancy\n\n【26】location \\[2， 6， 13，16， 17\\]. Intraoperative findings varied from massive 4L haemoperitoneum \\[20\\] to no haemoperitoneum at all \\[5-6， 13-14，27\\]. Twelve cases were diagnosed with SEPs intra-operatively， after surgeons noticed clots and blood coming from the left upper quadrant \\[7，9-11，18-25J. Seven patients who un-derwent laparoscopy for ectopic of unknown location required multiple operations after hCG levels continued to rise following initial surgery \\[2-3，5，8，11，26-27\\]. These 7 cases had no preop-erative abdominal ultrasound and minimal haemoperitoneum， making a diagnosis more difficult.\n\n【27】EP size varied from 11mm \\[7\\] to a fully formed 14 week ges-tational fetus \\[15\\]. Both the superior and inferior poles of the spleen were affected equally. The spleen was conserved in 5cases. Two were managed with splenorraphy \\[18， 27\\]. Three cases were managed with chemical termination： one patient with direct laparoscopic injection of methotrexate in the gestational sac \\[13\\]； another asymptomatic patient underwent an intramus-cular (IM) methotrexate injection followed by two image-guided procedures (aspiration of the EP yolk sac， and injection of potas-sium into the EP)\\[6\\]； another declined further surgery after 2unsuccessful laparoscopies and was subsequently treated suc-cessfully with 2 doses of IM methotrexate \\[3\\]. These patients required admission for 7 to 9 days， and ongoing ultrasound mon-itoring to confirm fetal demise. This proves that medical man-agement is possible， although hospital stay is often prolonged， and patient psychological stress has not been considered.\n\n【28】Conclusion\n\n【29】As SEPs are exceedingly rare， it is difficult to draw strong con-clusions from available evidence. There is a trend of patients presenting with mild pain and normal haemodynamic status， which may indicate earlier access to healthcare. We believe it prudent to perform abdominal ultrasound if the transvaginal ultrasound is unable to locate the pregnancy. If a patient under-goes surgery for an ectopic of unknown location， we recommend a thorough abdominal survey， as intraoperative diagnosis of SEP can occur. It may be difficult to recognize an SEP unless it causes severe hemoperitoneum or occurs at an advanced gestational age. If spleen conservation surgery is attempted， it may be worthwhile to have products of conception confirmed intraop-eratively by a pathologist. Although medical management of splenic ectopics is possible， we currently do not have enough evidence to recommend it over operative management.\n\n【30】Patient informed consent\n\n【31】The patient agreed that the case was published.\n\n【32】Conflict of interest\n\n【33】Author declare no conflict of interests.

It is characterized by hypertrophy of the left ventricle out of pro-portion to what can be explained by other cardiac or systemic diseases. It is a common cause of sudden cardiac death in young people \\[1.7\\]. Familial HCM is inherited in an autosomal dom-inant fashion， and the majority of mutations described are in proteins of the cardiac sarcomere \\[8\\].

Understanding of HCM has increased remarkably in the past several decades due to im-proved imaging quality and evolving genetic links identified by mutations in the cardiac sarcomeric proteins \\[10\\]. However， its clinical landscape continues to be diverse and is rapidly chang-ing. Aortic dilation is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S \\[11\\]. It is defined based on recent American Society of Echocardiography， and European Association of Cardiovas-cular Imaging published guidelines and using the definition of sinuses of Valsalva or ascending aorta diameter >40 mm for a male or >36 mm for a female.\n\n【13】The pathophysiologic basis of aortic dilation with other dis-eases has been proposed to be either genetic or hemodynamic. However， aortic pathology has recently been described in pa-\n\n【14】tients with HCM； common signalling pathways may mediate dilated aorta and HCM \\[12，131.\n\n【15】Patient And Observation\n\n【16】We report the case of a 64 years old patient with menopause and hypertension as cardiovascular risk factors and no significant pathological history， in particular， no sudden death in the family. Presented for NYHA stage II dyspnea evolving for 6 months without angina，neither palpitation nor syncope. On clinical ex-amination， she is conscious， hemodynamically and respiratory stable， with blood pressure at 115/65 mmHg symmetrical in the2 upper limbs and a heart rate at 62 bpm， without signs of heart failure with a systolic murmur at 4/6 at the mitral focus and perceived and symmetrical peripheral pulses. The electrocardio gram notes a regular sinus rhythm at 75 bpm， left ventricular hypertrophy with secondary repolarization disorders， and in-complete LBB (FIGURE1).\n\n【17】Figure 1 Electrocardiogramm.\n\n【18】On transthoracic ultrasound， we note an undilated left ventri-cle， hypertrophied with a septum interventricular at 16 mm and\n\n【19】a posterior wall at 16 mm， good global and segmental contractil-ity LVEF at 66% with an obstructive septal bulge (Intra LV gradi-ent= 73mmhg)，a dilated left atrium， free of echoes (LA volume at 57 ml/ m-)， a mitral valve seat of a calcification of the large mi-tral valve with severe mitral insufficiency by double mechanism SAM complete and elongation of the anterior leaf with doubt on the rupture of a small cord (FIGURE 2)， a tricuspid aortic valve seat of an aortic insufficiency minimal without stenosis， ascending aneurysmal aorta in its tubular portion (ascending at55mm)(FIGURE 3)， minimal tricuspid insufficiency estimating systolic blood pressure at 28+3=31 mmHg， RV non-dilated right duct with good longitudinal systolic function (S'VD=12m/s， TAPSE=25mm) and a non-dilated inferior vena cava at 18mm and compliant.\n\n【20】Figure 2 Elongation of the anterior leaf.\n\n【21】Figure 3 Aneurysmal ascending aorta in its tubular portion.\n\n【22】A supplement by transesophageal ultrasound was realized， objectifying a severe mitral insufficiency (FIGURE 4) by the defect of coaptation and elongation of the anterior sheet with redundant movement and doubt on the rupture of a small cord. Aneurysmal dilation of the ascending aorta (Root=24mm， Si-nus=34mm， Ascending aorta=50mm)(FIGURE 5) and a dilated left auricle with no visible thrombus.\n\n【23】The chest scan， there is significant aneurysmal dilation ex-tending from the aortic root to the proximal part of the arch of the aorta， upstream of the origin of the right subclavian artery， measuring 85\\*76 mm extended over 120 mm associated with\n\n【24】mediacalcosis (In the aortic In the ring at 30 mm 2.14cm/m²， Valsalva sinus at 34 mm 2.42 cm/m²， The sino-tubular junction at 35.5 mm 2.53 cm/m²).(FIGURE 6)\n\n【25】Figure 4 Severe mitral insufficiency.\n\n【26】Figure 5 Anevrysmal dilation of the ascending aorta.\n\n【27】The Holter electrocardiogram objectified frequent ventricular extrasystoles and numerous supraventricular extrasystoles.\n\n【28】The patient underwent coronary angiography and a biologi-cal assessment that returned to normal.\n\n【29】The patient was put on 40 mg/day of furosemide and biso-prolol 2.5 mg/day.\n\n【30】After the medico-surgical discussion， our patient underwent Bentall's procedure (FIGURE 7)； she was followed up in the postoperative period by echocardiography and clinical exami-nation to determine the effectiveness of this procedure. Again， there was a significant improvement in the symptomatic status with good effort tolerance.\n\n【31】Discussion\n\n【32】There have been conflicting results regarding the prevalence of aortic dilation in the population. Prior studies were limited primarily to small patient cohorts ranging from only 25-223 pa-tients \\[2， 15，16\\]. Clinical experience in a high-volume HCM centre showed that aortic dilation is common among HCM pa-tients. They found dilation of the tubular ascending aorta in 18%of HCM patients， 7-fold greater than expected in the general population. When using adjusted norms， aortic dilation was\n\n【33】Figure 6 Anevrysmal dilation extending from the aortic root to the proximal part of the arch of the aorta.\n\n【34】Figure 7 BENTALL Procedure.\n\n【35】present in 13%， again more common than expected in the gen-eral population. As demonstrated in patients without HCM，in-creasing age correlated with aortic enlargement >19 mm/m2.To our knowledge， aortic size at the level of the sinuses has not been previously reported in an HCM population. While the aortic disease has not been previously clinically recognized in HCM， a recent study by Boonyasirinant and colleagues showed that aortic stiffness increases in patients with HCM compared with controls as measured by magnetic resonance imaging pulse wave velocity \\[2\\]. Vizzardi and al. reported a slightly smaller mean indexed aortic dimension of 16 mm/m²among 25 HCM patients compared to the 16.5 mm/m- reported in this study \\[5\\]. When compared to 25 healthy controls， Vizzardi and al. did not find a difference in ascending aortic size. Still， there was a wide standard deviation of +6 mm/m² among HCM patients， reflect-ing the limitation of the small sample size and low power \\[5\\]. Gavaller et al. studied 38 patients with HCM. They reported a median non-indexed end-diastolic diameter of 29.5 mm at the as-cending aorta， smaller than the median value of 33 mm observed\n\n【36】herein \\[8\\]. Gavaller et al. found a larger non-indexed aortic di-mension among HCM patients compared to healthy controls(26.3 mm)， but not when compared to patients with hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy (29.8 mm). Jain et al. evaluated 105HCM patients who echocardiographic measurements of the as-cending aorta (223 studied) and reported a median non-indexed dimension of 34 mm \\[18\\]. This finding is similar to the current study. In addition， Jain et al. utilized the CT-derived nomo-gram published by Hannuksela et al. (age-adjusted， non-BSA adjusted) to define aortic dilation and found that 9.5% of these patients met the criteria for aortic dilation. Finally， Yousefzai et al. evaluated 201 HCM patients reporting aortic enlargement defined by age， sex， and BSA-adjusted norms in 9% of subjects， slightly less than reported here \\[16\\]. Importantly， these adjusted norms were based on work by Devereux et al. \\[17\\] but did not include adjusted norms for the mid-ascending aorta recently reported by Ayoub et al. \\[18\\]， an important distinction as in this study， the location of aortic dilation was primarily noted at the tubular level (71% of cases of dilation above-adjusted norms).\n\n【37】The tubular ascending aorta was not well visualized in a sub-stantial portion of the population， limiting definitive conclusions about this segment of the aorta. However， the ascending aorta in a smaller cohort of HCM patients is similar in size compared to controls \\[14\\]. Furthermore， similar to the aorta at the sinuses of Valsalva，no clinical parameters specific to HCM were associated with dilation of the ascending aorta.\n\n【38】That observation raises the possibility of an association be-tween two diverse entities. It leads to questions regarding their pathophysiological and/or genetic association. This association was speculated to result from a number of mechanisms， includ-ing intrinsic aortic fibrosis in HCM，neurohormonal disturbance， endothelial dysfunction， or abnormal left ventricular barorecep-tor response \\[14\\]. Interestingly， previous studies have shown a role of TGF-beta in the development of fibrosis and hypertrophy in HCM \\[4， 6，16J. TGF-beta also has an important association with the development of aortic aneurysms and dissection \\[6\\]. However， TGF-beta involvement in HCM may only be related to regional overexpression in the myocardium， in a mechanism independent of its involvement in aortic disease \\[7， 17\\]. It is well known that altered flow dynamics through a morphologically abnormal aortic valve change the spatial velocity gradients and thus create a shear stress stimulus on the aortic walls that alters gene expression and promotes endothelial remodelling.\\[19\\]. Similar flow dynamics in patients with obstructive HCM， or alterations in the spatial velocity gradients in the hypertrophied pathologic left ventricle in patients with obstructive and non-obstructive HCM， might contribute to aortic dilation in these pa-tients. These hemodynamic factors might be more pronounced in patients with intrinsic weakness of the aortic wall， especially in those with a genetic predisposition or other comorbidities contributing to the aortic disease. Given a higher prevalence of LVOT obstruction (72.2% vs 59.0%) in patients with aortic dilation in Yousefzai and al.， even though not statistically signif-icant， it appears plausible that hemodynamic alterations might be an etiopathogenetic factor for aortic dilation \\[13\\]. The mecha-nism of most aortopathies has been ascribed to dysregulation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-b)， which causes weak-ening and disordering of elastic fibre formation in the aortic wall， leading to aortic dilation； expression of the TGF-b gene is enhanced in patients with HCM. \\[7，12\\]. IGF-I and TGF-beta signals may be further amplified by increased receptor numbers on cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts \\[7，18\\]. Thus， these genetic\n\n【39】and molecular alterations， which can activate similar pathways， might explain， to some extent， the higher prevalence of aortic dilation in HCM patients. However， this needs to be proved further. This hypothesis was recently put to the test by Vizzardi and al. and showed impaired distensibility and stiffness of the aorta in HCM patients compared to the control group. \\[17\\].In Yousefzai and al study， 2 out of 5 patients (40%) with HCM and aortic dilation who were tested for TAAD gene tested positive for mutation； however， the true genetic links between HCM and aortic dilation remain unknown because of the small sample group \\[13\\]. This unique subset of patients with concomitant HCM and aortic dilation could be at higher risk for adverse events， including the risk of aortic aneurysm. The concept of the cause of obstruction changes from early ideas that a muscular outflow tract sphincter was the cause， through the discovery of systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflet， to the current understanding that flow drag， the pushing force of flow， is the dominant hydrodynamic mechanism for SAM. Accordingly， the continuing redesign and modification of surgical procedures to relieve outflow obstruction have corresponded to ideas about the cause of this condition.\n\n【40】Conclusion\n\n【41】It is important to assess the exact prevalence of this association via a collaborative effort across institutions. Careful and detailed evaluation of HCM registry patients might help us understand the association of HCM and aortic dilation in large populations in order to gain insights into the clinical outcomes of the pa-tients in whom these entities coexist and understand the genetic， molecular， and hemodynamic interplay that might alter the phe-notypic expression and clinical course of these patients in order to determine the appropriate surveillance and monitoring.\n\n【42】Abbreviation\n\n【43】BSA ： Body Surface Area\n\n【44】HCM ： Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy\n\n【45】IGF-1 ： Insulin-like Growth Factor 1\n\n【46】LA ： Left Atrium\n\n【47】LV ： Left Ventricular\n\n【48】LVEF ： Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction\n\n【49】LVOT ： Left Ventricular Outflow Tract\n\n【50】NYHA ： New York Heart Association\n\n【51】SAM ： Systolic Movement of the Anterior mitral valve\n\n【52】TAAD ： Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms and Dissection\n\n【53】TGF-B ： Transforming Growth Factor Beta\n\n【54】U.S ： United Stat\n\n【55】Conflict of Interest\n\n【56】The authors declare no conflict of interest related to this study\n\n【57】References\n\n【58】1\\.

It was isolated from a patient of a local outbreak of pneumonia with unknown aetiology.\\[1，2\\] Based on a tracing of the infected people in Wuhan， a varying amount of exposure to Wuhan's wet animal market has been commonly found. It was then con-cluded that this is likely the zoonotic origin of COVID-19.\\[3\\] Phylogenetically， this virus is related to the severe acute res-piratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and the Middle East\n\n【14】Travel-Inducted Transmission\n\n【15】According to current evidence， SARS-CoV-2 is primarily trans-mitted between people through respiratory droplets and either direct or fomite contact. \\[6，7，8，9，10\\] Albeit an identical transmis-sion method to SARS coronavirus， SARS-CoV-2's transmission rate is comparatively higher than that of early 2000's SARS coro navirus， reaching an estimated mean R0 of 3.28 and a median of2.79.\\[10，11\\] The difference in transmission rate is due to distinct infectious period， transmissibility， clinical severity， and extent of community spread than that of SARS coronavirus. However traditional public health protocols similar as those used to erad-icate SARS such as extensive surveillance， prompt isolation of patients， strict enforcement of quarantine of all contacts， and in some areas： top-down enforcement of community quaran-tine may still be effective in reducing peak incidence and global deaths.\\[5\\]\n\n【16】Efforts such as large-scale community quarantine and lock-downs may cause numerous side effects， viewed in a macro perspective， hitting hard world economy with a decrease in GDP growth- although part of it is due to China being an integral part to nearly every sector of the world economy.\\[12\\] Viewed in a micro perspective， personal religious reasons and a segment of population working day-to-day pay jobs may contribute to local government's order to not impose major preventive mea-sures.\\[13\\] To keep it simple： if a full-scale lockdown is imposed unconditionally， the government forecasts a huge damage to the country's economy.\\[14\\] However， a policy too lax on biomedical security from local governments added with disobedience from local community may end up exponentially increasing epidemic proportions. This situation on hand creates an ambiguity on boundaries ought to be necessarily taken. Therefore， to han-dle the problem efficiently， a solution justifying both adequate biomedical security and economic interests of all population seg-ment is required to deal with the pandemic to avoid additional cross-sector damage within the country.\n\n【17】An order from President of Indonesia ruling out an imme-diate easing of social distancing rules despite rising numbers of cases had caused breaches of large-scale social restrictions， labelled as a blunder to series of preventive efforts taken before-hand by the local government.\\[14\\] This is also largely due to pressure on reopening businesses and an increase in poverty within the nation， which urged the government to ease lock-downs despite rising COVID-19 cases.15 As mass transporta-tions started to operate， people began to move around the coun-try， causing the unintended spread of the virus from a part of the country to another as around half or even more of COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic.\\[16，17\\] Both local and international migrant workers began moving around freely despite risking community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 along the journey.\n\n【18】Of the 150 million international migrant workers worldwide，95% reside in the five WHO regions in which cases of coro-navirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been confirmed. The absence of a coordinated response for IMW highlights a key deficiency in public health planning.\\[18\\] According to the In-donesian Bureau of Statistics， there are up to 16.542 Indonesians working as international migrant workers placed on March 2020alone. This number has chronologically dropped from 17.757on February 2020 and 20.196 in January 2020， allegedly caused by fear of catching the disease.\\[19，20，21\\] On a bright side， a 20%\n\n【19】decrease in migrant workers starting to work overseas within ap-proximately two months showed a good self-awareness within Indonesian migrant workers， self-protecting themselves by stay-ing back home to socially distance.\\[19，21\\] However， a glance to places where they come to may arise concerns of unintended mass transmission. Although the overall number of Indonesian Migrant Workers (IMW) growth may decrease， a 5% and 30%increase of IMW placed in Taiwan and Hong Kong， respectively， increases chances of community transmission by IMW when they depart back from places they work from.\\[19，21\\]\n\n【20】As IMW's work often involves travelling between or inside foreign countries， exposure to diverse elements of foreign people increases， raising chances of contracting the disease. Asymp-tomatic cases and poorly applied biomedical security in destina-tion countries may further contribute to the rapid spread of the virus throughout the home nation.\n\n【21】Population Mobility\n\n【22】During this COVID-19 pandemic period， 121.498 IMW as per March 21，2020， had returned to their home nation because of ex-piration of work contracts， attending a vacation leave from their workplaces， or because of either direct or indirect termination related to COVID-19 outbreaks inside the country where they work.\\[22，23\\] National Agency for the Placement and Protection of Indonesian Migrant Workers in an article written by Prabowo(2020) predicted that 37，075 IMW would return to the country mid-April to May 2020 during Ramadhan， a sacred month for Muslim communities in the nation.\\[23\\] Alongside massive repa-triations， it is a common in the country to practice mudik， a term used to describe the annual activity of going home to respec-tive regions and meeting distant relatives at the end of the holy month for Muslims. Therefore， repatriation of IMW further com-plimented by mass mobility of the country’s population may cause massive local widespread of SARS-CoV-2， heightening the curve in the country.\n\n【23】Solution\n\n【24】A joint strategy internationally coordinated to limit COVID-19 spread simultaneously must be enforced. Tight screenings and unyielding protocols are to be implemented inside every mass public transportation terminals， both receiving local and international visitors.\n\n【25】A letter issued by Indonesian Minister of Health numbered HK.02.01/MENKES/313/2020 titled Health Protocols for Han-dling Return of Indonesian Residents and Arrival of Overseas Foreigners in Regions Applying Large-Scale Social Limitations obliged Indonesian citizens and foreigners arriving in regions applying large-scale social limitations to undergo interview com-bined with body heat， COVID-19 symptoms， oxygen saturation， and rapid or PCR tests. Common COVID-19 symptoms obvi-ous and practical enough to inspect include elevated core body temperature and dry cough， though it may vary according to co-morbid.\\[24\\] However， arrivers are exempted from taking rapid and PCR tests when they can show a Health Certificate stating they are negative of COVID-19 tested by PCR method from a maximum of 7 days since the sample was taken.\\[25\\]\n\n【26】People unable to show a legal health certificate with require-ments stated by the government must undergo a period of quar-antine while taking PCR (if available) or rapid serological test to prove his negativity of COVID-19.\\[25\\] Even though IMW repa-triation is reported to have fulfilled adequate health protocols，\n\n【27】it does not rule out the possibility of IMW at risk of becoming infected with the virus during transit or while returning to their respective home areas.\\[22\\]\n\n【28】Conflict of interest\n\n【29】There are no conflicts of interest to declare by any of the authors of this study.\n\n【30】References\n\n【31】1\\.

In non-bacteremia patients， sepsis is not a common complication. Immunocompromised patients are more commonly affected. If diagnosis and therapy are delayed， the mor-tality rate is 18-96%. This report is of a 52-year-old man with diabetes mellitus and myelofibrosis presenting with hemorrhagic vesiculobullous lesions of ecthyma gangrenosum on the upper and lower extremities， oral mucosa， and anogenital area with， interestingly， no associated Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia.\n\n【25】Case Report：\n\n【26】A 52-year-old diabetes patient with myelofibrosis presented with hemorrhagic vesiculobullous and necrotic eschar-covered erosions over the upper and lower extremities， oral mucosa， and anogenital area. Although he appeared septic looking initially， with signs of end-stage organ failure， and he was later determined to have septic shock， the clinical diagnosis was not possible without a positive culture swab of the cutaneous lesions showing growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The diagnosis of cutaneous ecthyma gangrenosum-induced sep-tic shock was confirmed， though bacteremia was not detected. This patient was successfully managed with the early initiation of proper antibiotics.\n\n【27】Conclusions：\n\n【28】Early detection and vigilance when confronted with the clinical presentation of ecthyma gangrenosum are a vital part of patient management to reduce the high mortality risk of the disease. Although bacteremia is as-sociated with a high risk for fatalities， cutaneous ecthyma gangrenosum can be complicated by septic shock and serious adverse events. The involvement of multidisciplinary teams in patient management is an essential aspect of ecthyma gangrenosum disease management.\n\n【29】Keywords： Ecthyma， Contagious·Sepsis ·Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation·Systemic Vasculitis\n\n【30】Vasculitis · Skin Diseases， Vesiculobullous· aadA6 protein， Pseudomonas aeruginosa\n\n【31】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/939905\n\n【32】目者 1062 盟- HL03 非7\n\n【33】Publisher's note： All daims expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of their affiliated\n\n【34】AP\n\n【35】organizations， or those of the publisher the editors and the reviewers.

In non-bacteremia patients， sep sis is not a common complication， and immunocompromised patients are more commonly affected. If diagnosis and thera-py are delayed， the mortality rate is 18-96%\\[2\\]. Early diagno-sis， with special attention to cutaneous and clinical findings， is vital for effective case management. Here， we present a case of unusual cutaneous ecthyma gangrenosum complicated by septic shock and end-organ failure despite the absence of bac-teremia and neutropenia. Thus， in immunocompromised pa-tients with suspected signs of septic shock， careful examina-tion of any skin lesion might reveal the source of infection.\n\n【37】Case Report\n\n【38】Three days following the administration of amikacin for an E. coli-infected amputation stump of the big toe， a 52-year-old diabetes patient with myelofibrosis presented with hemor-rhagic vesicular eruption， vesiculobullous lesions， and necrot-ic eschar-covered erosive ulcerated lesions over the upper and lower extremities， gluteal and anogenital areas， and oral and nasal mucosa. The lesions were also associated with a right eye discharge (Figures 1， 2). The patient was pale and looked unwell. Moreover， he presented with severe lower gastrointes-tinal bleeding. His blood pressure was 98/54 mmHg， and his temperature was 36.7℃. Blood chemistry and complete blood count (CBC) laboratory test results were as follows： CBC includ-ing platelets： 396x10° (his baseline was 600-900)； white blood cells (WBC)： 17×10/L (4-10)； hemoglobin： 5.7 G/dL (13-17)； WBC differential： 85% neutrophils and 8% lymphocytes； plate let large cell ratio： 40%； arterial blood gas analyses： pH： 7.36， pCO2： 36.9 mmHg， p02： 31 mmHg， a02： 33.4%； urea： 39.7mmol/L (3.2-7.1)； creatinine： 290 umol/L (53-120)； aspartate transaminase： 424 U/L (0-40)； alanine transaminase： 395 U/L(30-65)； direct bilirubin： 20.8 umol/L (2-5)； international nor-malized ratio： 3.6%(0.9-1.2)； partial thromboplastin time： 45.9seconds (26-36)； prothrombin time： 46.9 seconds (9.8-13.2).\n\n【39】Because the patient gave a history of severe beta-lactam-in-duced allergic reactions， a non-dermatologist suspected that anaphylaxis was the underlying cause of his initial clinical pre-sentation； ie， hypotension and a cutaneous rash that appeared right after systemic antibiotic ingestion.\n\n【40】However， after a careful examination of the nature of his cu-taneous lesions by an expert dermatologist， along with the overall clinical status and the preliminary lab findings， septic shock with signs of end-stage organ failure was suspected to be the top differential diagnosis.\n\n【41】Figure 1. (A-C) Ecthyma gangrenosum. Hemorrhagic vesicular lesions with eschar-covered ulcers over the patient's extremities.\n\n【42】Figure 2. (A， B) Ecthyma gangrenosum. Necrotic erosions over the lips and tongue.\n\n【43】A B\n\n【44】Figure 3. (A， B) Ecthyma gangrenosum histology H&E staining of the skin (40x) shows epidermal necrosis and sloughing， sparse neutrophilic vasculitis that extends deeply into the subcutaneous tissue， and violaceous fibrinous debris surrounding the vascular wall.\n\n【45】A bacterial culture grown from a swab of a leg cutaneous le-sion underneath the scab was positive for Pseudomonas aeru-ginosa. Histopathological findings of an ulcerated vesicular le-sion obtained from the thumb showed epidermal necrosis and sloughing， in addition to sparse neutrophilic vasculitis that ex-tended deeply into the subcutaneous tissue， with violaceous fi-brinous debris surrounding the vascularwall (Figure 3). A Gram stain preparation of the tissue revealed numerous gram-neg-ative rods surrounding necrotic blood vessels.\n\n【46】Upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed and failed to identify any necrotic， inflammatory， or pathologic causes of bleeding， which was probably related to the deterio-ration of his coagulation profile. Given these results， a diagno-sis of ecthyma gangrenosum-induced septic shock was made.\n\n【47】Since this patient had a history of severe allergic reactions to beta-lactam antibiotics， and the antibacterial sensitivity results were readily available within the first 3 days， levofloxacin was initiated to treat the antibiotic-resistant Pseudomonas sp. infec-tion. This patient was successfully managed with early initiation of proper antibiotics after consulting infectious disease special-ists and was discharged from the intensive care unit 10 days af-ter starting the antibiotics. Six weeks after being discharged from the hospital， the patient was doing well， his renal and liver func-tions were normal， and his coagulation profile was also normal.\n\n【48】Discussion\n\n【49】Although the patient presented to the emergency room as hy-potensive， the timeline between the administration of amikacin\n\n【50】and his presentation， as well as the types of skin lesions， did not suggest a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction. The most com-monly reported allergic reactions to aminoglycosides are caused by gentamicin and tobramycin， with amikacin being the least reported cause. Allergies to aminoglycosides are infrequent compared with cephalosporins or quinolones \\[3\\].\n\n【51】Microscopic polyangiitis would be another differential diagno-sis to consider in the context of small-medium vessel neutro-philic vasculitis and clear evidence of acute kidney injury (AKI). However， in septic-looking， hypotensive patients with signs of end-stage organ failure， disseminated intravascular coagula-tion (DIC)-induced hemorrhage， and clear evidence of positive bacterial culture， a diagnosis of ecthyma gangrenosum com-plicated by septic shock is highly suggested \\[4\\].\n\n【52】The patient's clinical findings were highly suggestive of bacterial sepsis， including a systolic blood pressure of <90 mmHg， neutro-phil/lymphocyte ratio of>10：1， and relative thrombocytopenia， with a high platelet large cell ratio， while the following compli-cations suggested septic shock： AKI， DIC， and acute respiratory distress syndrome \\[5\\]. Although the patient was afebrile， immu-nocompromised patients can develop sepsis with normothermia.\n\n【53】Although ecthyma gangrenosum is commonly associated with Pseudomonas bacteremia， it rarely presents as a primary skin infection. Our patient’s blood and urine cultures were negative， which was favorable regarding the likelihood of a response to treatment. Blood cultures may be obtained before initiating antibiotic therapy； however， immediate treatment for septic shock should ensue without delay. Ecthyma gangrenosum has a high mortality rate if diagnosis and treatment is delayed； thus， prompt treatment strategies under the care of a multi-disciplinary team involving infectious disease specialists and the intensive care unit must be implemented.\n\n【54】References：\n\n【55】1\\.

We aimed to explore potential therapeutic drugs for COVID-19 via computational approaches. Material and methods： The RNA sequencing datasets of COVID-19 were downloaded by using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The Database for Annotation， Visualization， and Integrated Discovery(DAVID) was used for examining the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of DEGs. RStudio software SubpathwayMiner package was utilized to conduct pathway analysis on DEGs affected by drugs found in the Connectivity Map (CMap) and Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database was utilized to construct Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of DEGs. COVID-19-related pathways were integrated to identify potential novel drugs for COVID-19. Results： The results revealed that 1613 DEGs were acquired from GEO. We obtained26 significant pathways of COVID-19 utilizing KEGG pathway analysis. We determined the MAPK signalling pathway and 47 CMap small-molecule drugs that affected this pathway. The PPI network analysis revealed that the NRAS， PAK1， RAP1A， and GNG12 are closely associated with an overlapping pathway (MAPK). Further literature verification results indicated that the effect of fluticasone and monensin on COVID-19 had been studied. Conclusions： Ambroxol，cefotiam and benzathine benzylpenicillin have never been addressed for COVID-19 in the literature， and they might be potential novel drugs for this disease. In-vitro， in-vivo and further studies are required to verify the molecular mechanism and definite effects of the potential novel medicines on COVID-19.\n\n【5】KEYWORDS COVID-19， KEGG pathway， CMap database， small-molecule drugs， MAPK\n\n【6】1\\. Introduction\n\n【7】Pneumonia cases of unknown causes were reported in Wuhan， Hubei Province， China， December 2019. This situation was later specified to be caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The clinical condition caused by novel coronavirus is called as COVID-19 \\[1-3\\]. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are genotypically and phenotypically diverse and can cause\n\n【8】Copyright @ 2020 by the Bulgarian Association of Young Surgeons\n\n【9】DOI：10.5455/IJMRCR.covid-19-drugs\n\n【10】First Received： September 23，2020Accepted： October 07， 2020\n\n【11】Associate Editor： Ivan Inkov (BG)；1Department of Biophysics， Faculty of Medicine， SANKO University， Gaziantep， Turkeyi\n\n【12】tdenkceken@sanko.edu.tr； Phone： +903422116561\n\n【13】disease in mammals， birds， and humans. COVID-19 is an acute respiratory infectious disease， which spreads through the respi-ratory tract， by secretions， direct contact， and droplets \\[4\\].\n\n【14】Connectivity Map (CMap) is a gene expression profile database utilized to process the genomic data \\[5\\]. CMap uses the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to create a biological application database based on the small-molecule drug connec-tions， different diseases， and gene expression. We aimed to find novel potential small-molecule drugs for COVID-19 via on-line databases. We implemented an in-silico method to explore novel potential drugs for COVID-19 based on the integrated sub-pathway analysis. First， we identified the DEGs between 16autopsy samples from five COVID-19 patients and five negative autopsy control samples identified and then determined the po-tential pathways of COVID-19. Then， we utilized CMap to verify the pathways of COVID-19 affected by small-molecule drugs.\n\n【15】Lastly， small-molecule drugs that can target sub-pathways asso-ciated with COVID-19 were considered as novel potential drugs in the treatment. The candidate drugs determined in our study may present a novel direction for the treatment of COVID-19.\n\n【16】The relation between SARS-CoV-2 lung infection and pul-monary disease severity has not been fully brightened. In the original study that we acquired the Gene Expression Omnibus(GEO) dataset， autopsy samples from patients deceased due to SARS-CoV2 infection had been collected for total RNAseg analysis to assess viral load and immune response.\n\n【17】2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【18】2.1. DEG analysis of COVID-19\n\n【19】The RNA sequencing datasets (GSE150316) of COVID-19 were downloaded by using the GEO of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) publicly available database. The dataset consists of 16 autopsy samples from five COVID-19patients and five negative autopsy control samples. We com-pared these two groups to determine DEGs. Among these data， only the genes with fold change (FC)>1.5， FC<-1.5， and p<0.05were determined as DEGs， including down-regulated and up-regulated ones. Quality scores were assessed using FastQC2. Reads were aligned to the Homo sapiens genome build GRCh38. Gene expression matrices with raw counts were processed with Deseq2\\[6\\].\n\n【20】2.2. Enrichment analysis of DEGs\n\n【21】DEGs were performed using the Database for Annotation， Visu-alization， and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) database to imple-ment the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. The species was limited to \"Homo sapiens\"and the p<0.05 cut-off was considered as significant.\n\n【22】2.3. Comprehensive analysis between KEGG pathways and CMap database\n\n【23】A comprehensive analysis was carried between the KEGG path-ways and CMap database to explore the molecular mechanism and describe novel potential therapeutic drugs in COVID-19.Ac-cordingly， the association between DEGs pathways from KEGG and 1309 drugs from the CMap database were defined. Firstly the DEGs were set the query signature format file， including the down-regulated and up-regulated gene， and imported to the CMap quick query \\[7，8\\]. Next， the microarray profiles and their related annotation files were downloaded from the CMap database. CMap raw data were extracted， and the control and treatment groups of the microarray profiles were matched ac-cording to the definition in the annotation file. Secondly， the small-molecule therapeutic drugs for the DEGs of COVID-19were acquired via CMap. RStudio software SubpathwayMiner package was utilized to implement KEGG sub-pathway analy-sis on the genes affected by the small-molecule drugs found in CMap to obtain the enriched pathways affected by each small-molecule drugs. Finally， COVID-19-related pathways and en-riched pathways for the small-molecule drugs were integrated to achieve overlapping pathways for subsequent analysis and research. FC >1， FC<-1， and p<0.05 cut-off values were accepted as statistically significant.\n\n【24】2.4. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construc-tion of overlapping pathways\n\n【25】Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) online database was utilized to construct Protein-protein inter-action (PPI) networks of DEGs \\[9\\] and Cytoscape software was utilized to analyze the interaction associations of proteins en-coded by DEGs from overlapping pathways \\[10\\]. In the PPI networks， edges symbolize the interactions between DEGs and nodes symbolize the DEGs. The genes with a node degree ≥4were regarded as hub-genes.\n\n【26】3\\. Results\n\n【27】3.1. Screening results of DEGs\n\n【28】1613 DEGs were acquired， including 1063 up-regulated and 550down-regulated genes， and subsequent analysis was based on this result.\n\n【29】3.2. KEGG pathway analysis\n\n【30】KEGG pathway analysis was conducted to acquire biological functions of 1613 DEGs. Totally 26 KEGG pathways were listed in table 1， significantly enriched with a p-value<0.05.\n\n【31】3.3. Screening results of CMap\n\n【32】CMap database raw data were analyzed using the RStudio soft-ware SubpathwayMiner package to determine the pathways affected by small-molecule drugs. The results revealed that nine pathways， including 20 sub-pathways， were closely related to COVID-19， as shown in Table 2.\n\n【33】The intersection of KEGG pathways and small-molecule drug correlative pathways was acquired. Concerning a previous method \\[11\\]，weconducted a sub-pathway analysis and obtained20 sub-pathways. After integrating these 20 sub-pathways with26 KEGG pathways generated by the DEGs， a pathway related to antiCOVID-19 small-molecule drugs were finally achieved， including the MAPK signalling pathway (Figure 1).\n\n【34】This pathway was related to 47 CMap small-molecule drugs and 33 genes. The genes involved in this KEGG pathway were ELK4， GNG12， PTPN7，JUN， PLA2G2A， GADD45A， RAP1A， FASLG，NRAS，RASGRP3，IL1R2，IL1B，MAP3K2，CACNA1D， FGF1， CD14， HSPA1L，HSPB1，PDGFA， TGFBR1， DUSP5，FAS， RASGRP2，RRAS2，CACNA1F，PAK1，DUSP6，NR4A1， PRKCB， MAP4K1， GADD45B， CDC25B， and RAC2. The PPI analysis with the above 33 genes showed four hub-genes (NRAS，PAK1， RAP1A， and GNG12) (Figure 2). The top five most significant CMap small-molecule drugs were ambroxol， cefotiam， benza-thine benzylpenicillin， fluticasone， and monensin.\n\n【35】3.4. Verifying of predicting small-molecule drugs of COVID-19 by literature\n\n【36】We examined the PubMed database through the MESH search headings： \"Drug name\" AND (COVID OR CoV OR Coron-aviruses) AND (respiratory OR respiration OR lung OR pneu-monia). The searches were not limited to article type， species， languages， sex， subjects， or age. We defined studies that in-vestigated the relevant drug effects on COVID-19. We found two studies concerned fluticasone， and only one study was re-lated to monensin. Most importantly， ambroxol， cefotiam， and benzathine benzylpenicillin have never been addressed in the literature of COVID-19.\n\n【37】Figure 2： Protein-protein interaction of 33 genes.\n\n【38】Discussion\n\n【39】World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19epidemic as a public health emergency of worldwide concern on 30 January 2020. As of 22 September 2020， there have been31.174.627 globally confirmed cases of COVID-19， including962.613 deaths，reported to WHO. In this study， we determined DEGs of COVID-19 and obtained a pathway and hub-genes that may play a crucial role in the COVID-19. Additionally， through the CMap approach， ambroxol， cefotiam， benzathine benzylpeni-cillin， fluticasone， and monensin compounds were determined to share the identical pathways of those generated from the DEGs of COVID-19. The findings from our study suggest that ambroxol， cefotiam， and benzathine benzylpenicillin could be new potential therapeutic drugs for the treatment of COVID-19and warrant further research as they have never been tested before.\n\n【40】The CMap database shows the connection between genes， drugs， and disease utilizing gene expression data and the \"sim-ilarity\" approach with gene expression of the drug or small-molecule compound \\[12\\]. CMap database ensures an essential technique for the development of drugs through comparison to filter candidate compounds curing diseases \\[13， 14\\].\n\n| Pathway ID  | Pathway Name  | P-value  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| pathway0002673  | Systemic lupus erythematosus  | 7.74E-22  |\n| pathway0002575  | p53 signaling pathway  | 0.000666  |\n| pathway0002675  | Graft-versus-host disease  | 0.000918  |\n| pathway0002609  | B cell receptor signaling pathway  | 0.00123  |\n| pathway0002582  | Phagosome  | 0.00135  |\n| pathway0002649  | Leishmaniasis  | 0.00142  |\n| pathway0002651  | Malaria  | 0.00179  |\n| pathway0002674  | Allograft rejection  | 0.00221  |\n| pathway0002611  | Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis  | 0.00242  |\n| pathway0002568  | Chemokine signaling pathway  | 0.00446  |\n| pathway0002607  | Natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity  | 0.00537  |\n| pathway0002630  | Type I diabetes mellitus  | 0.0055  |\n| pathway0002592  | Axon guidance  | 0.00586  |\n| pathway0002603  | NOD-like receptor signaling pathway  | 0.00785  |\n| pathway0002562  | MAPK signaling pathway  | 0.00792  |\n| pathway0002650  | Chagas disease  | 0.00822  |\n| pathway0002596  | Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs)  | 0.0104  |\n| pathway0002481  | Fructose and mannose metabolism  | 0.0171  |\n| pathway0002656  | Pathways in cancer  | 0.0177  |\n| pathway0002623  | Regulation ofactin cytoskeleton  | 0.0189  |\n| pathway0002654  | Staphylococcus aureus infection  | 0.0276  |\n| pathway0002653  | Amoebiasis  | 0.037  |\n| pathway0002567  | Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction  | 0.0373  |\n| pathway0002525  | Arachidonicacid metabolism  | 0.0377  |\n| pathway0002572  | Cell cycle-yeast  | 0.0379  |\n| pathway0002646  | Epithelial cell signaling in Helicobacter pylori infection  | 0.0414  |\n\n【42】In this study， the DEGs between 16 autopsy samples from five COVID-19 patients and five negative autopsy control sam-ples were compared with the expression profiles in CMap to define negatively correlative compounds which are potential small-molecule compounds for COVID-19. Among the can-didate compounds identified in our study， three compounds(ambroxol， cefotiam， and benzathine benzylpenicillin) are in-credibly important. Ambroxol is a secretolytic agent utilized in respiratory disease treatment associated with excessive mu-cus or viscid. The substance is a mucoactive drug with various features that restore the physiological clearance mechanisms of the respiratory tract that play an essential role in the natural defence mechanisms of the body. It stimulates the release of surfactants that decreases alveolar surface tension throughout the lung and keeping the bronchioles from collapsing during expiration and allowing bronchioles to expand during inspira-tion \\[15， 16\\]. Cefotiam is a broad-spectrum antibiotic， which is effective against gram-negative and positive bacteria \\[17\\]. Ben-\n\n【43】zathine benzylpenicillin is used when rapid， and high penicillin levels are required as in the treatment of meningitis， septicemia， endocarditis， severe pneumonia， and pericarditis \\[18， 19\\].\n\n【44】In our study， we indicated that ambroxol had the lowest connectivity score (-0.866)， showing a highly negative correla-tion with the DEGs of COVID-19. Cefotiam and benzathine benzylpenicillin which has the same connectivity score (-0.843) also suggest that they can inhibit the growth of COVID-19. Be-sides， this study predicted that ambroxol， cefotiam， and benza-thine benzylpenicillin could play an essential role in inhibiting COVID-19 by regulating the mitogen-activated protein kinase(MAPK) signalling pathway. Previous researches have revealed that the MAPK signalling pathways are involved in signal trans-duction through transmembrane receptors. In addition， it plays a crucial role in the fibrotic process of many major organs， such as myocardial fibrosis， renal fibrosis， and pulmonary fibrosis \\[20-22\\]. Three MAPKs have been identified in the regulation of lung inflammation in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis， which is a type\n\n【45】Table 2 The results of pathway analysis for the Connectivity Map database.\n\n| SubPathway ID  | Pathway ID  | Pathway Name  | p-value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| pathway0002615\\_01  | pathway0002615  | Circadian rhythm-fly  | 0.00459  |\n| pathway0002579\\_08  | pathway0002579  | Protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum  | 0.006  |\n| pathway0002579\\_05  | pathway0002579  | Protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum  | 0.0122  |\n| pathway0002579\\_06  | pathway0002579  | Protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum  | 0.0122  |\n| pathway0002662\\_01  | pathway0002662  | Prostate cancer  | 0.0145  |\n| pathway0002551\\_01  | pathway0002551  | Nitrogen metabolism  | 0.0159  |\n| pathway0002562\\_012  | pathway0002562  | MAPK signaling pathway  | 0.016  |\n| pathway0002562\\_02  | pathway0002562  | MAPK signaling pathway  | 0.0178  |\n| pathway0002531\\_01  | pathway0002531  | Glycosphingolipid biosynthesis-ganglio series  | 0.0254  |\n| pathway0002562\\_09  | pathway0002562  | MAPK signaling pathway  | 0.0294  |\n| pathway0002577\\_03  | pathway0002577  | SNARE interactions in vesicular transport  | 0.0327  |\n| pathway0002579\\_02  | pathway0002579  | Protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum  | 0.0327  |\n| pathway0002562\\_05  | pathway0002562  | MAPK signaling pathway  | 0.033  |\n| pathway0002562\\_014  | pathway0002562  | MAPK signaling pathway  | 0.0338  |\n| pathway0002562\\_019  | pathway0002562  | MAPK signaling pathway  | 0.0346  |\n| pathway0002577\\_02  | pathway0002577  | SNARE interactions in vesicular transport  | 0.0366  |\n| pathway0002595\\_01  | pathway0002595  | ECM-receptor interaction  | 0.0405  |\n| pathway0002562\\_07  | pathway0002562  | MAPK signaling pathway  | 0.042  |\n| pathway0002614\\_01  | pathway0002614  | Circadian rhythm-mammal  | 0.0449  |\n| pathway0002562\\_010  | pathway0002562  | MAPK signaling pathway  | 0.0483  |\n\n【47】of chronic scarring lung disease characterized by a progressive and irreversible decline in lung function \\[22\\].\n\n【48】Two other compounds obtained in our study have been men-tioned in other COVID-19 research. Fluticasone was found pos-sible interesting drugs for Covid-19 treatment \\[23\\]. Fluticasone propionate is a corticosteroid utilized in asthma treatment \\[24\\]. In another study， a suspected patient with COVID-19 was treated with inhaled fluticasone spray 250mcg/dose (1 puff a day) \\[25\\]. Monensin is an ionophoric antibiotic used to treat bacterial， fun-gal， and parasitic infections. Shen et al. showed that monensin has inhibitory activity against multiple genetically distinct Coro-naviruses in-vitro at low-micromolar concentrations \\[26\\]. In our study， we utilized bioinformatical approaches to screen biomark-ers based on RNAseq data. The DEGs were examined with CMap and sub-pathways， andMAPK signalling pathway was determined to be closely related to the treatment potential of COVID-19.\n\n【49】NRAS，PAK1， RAP1A， and GNG12 were determined as hub-genes. The clinical role of these hub-genes was investigated， and it was found that P21-Activated Kinase 1 (PAK1) was up-regulated in patients with COVID-19. Previous research was shown that PAK1 and CREB expression levels were significantly elevated in human squamous non-small cell lung carcinoma(NSCLC)， compared with normal bronchial tissue specimens. It was also showed that inhibition of PAK1 expression decreased NSCLC tumor masses and sizes \\[27\\]. Also， we found NRAS， RAP1A， and G protein subunit gamma 12 (GNG12) were down-\n\n【50】regulated in patients with COVID-19. RAP1A is a type of Ras-associated protein 1 (RAP1) and it was found that this gene down-regulated in lung adenocarcinoma cells \\[28，29\\]. Besides， NRAS and GNG12 were found as hub-genes in lung cancer in the literature 30，311.\n\n【51】Conclusion\n\n【52】In this study， we comprehensively analyzed the possible mecha-nism of curing COVID-19 using bioinformatics methods. MAPK signalling pathway and PAK1， NRAS，RAP1A， and GNG12 as potential targets of COVID-19 treatment. We further predicted that the top five compounds might be effective in COVID-19， including ambroxol， cefotiam， and benzathine benzylpenicillin that have never been previously reported to cure COVID-19. Nevertheless， some limitations should be admitted. First， the current findings were based on autopsy samples， in-silico meth-ods and validations are needed. Second， CMap did not include lung cell lines. Also， the overlapping pathways of DEGs from GEO and pathways from CMap need to be confirmed. Third， the exact mechanism of the recommended drugs should be ex-amined. Hence， in-vitro，in-vivo and further clinical studies are needed to verify the molecular mechanism and definite effects of the potential therapeutic medicines on COVID-19.\n\n【53】Funding\n\n【54】This study received no fund.\n\n【55】Conflict of interest\n\n【56】There are no conflicts of interest to declare by any of the authors of this study\n\n【57】References\n\n【58】1\\.

Segmental arterial mediolysis is clinically heterogeneous and symptoms may be completely nonspecific. The knowledge of radiological features of segmental arterial mediolysis and the ex-clusion of other pathologies should direct early diagnosis and refer patients for correct treatment.\n\n【28】Case Report：\n\n【29】In the last 2 years， we treated 2 different adult patients (an 89-year-old woman and a 52-year-old man) with spontaneous visceral bleeding， admitted to the Emergency Department due to acute onset of abdominal pain， anemia， and computed tomographic angiography (CTA) evidence of aneurysmatic， and stenotic alterations of splanchnic arteries. Based on clinical， laboratory， and radiological features， segmental arterial mediolysis was suspected. These 2 patients were referred to our Interventional Radiology Department and treated with super-selective transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE)， performed by a minimally invasive approach， allowing an immediate clinical improvement with regression of symptoms and avoiding major surgical treatment.\n\n【30】Conclusions：\n\n【31】In patients with clinical， laboratory， and radiological signs of acute and/or chronic abdominal bleeding and ra-diological findings suggesting segmental arterial mediolysis， mini-invasive endovascular treatment is a safe， extremely reliable， and secure procedure and appears to be the first-choice treatment when available. Since abdominal bleeding could have fatal consequences in these patients， timely diagnosis and endovascular ther-apy are essential to treat visceral vascular alterations due to segmental arterial mediolysis.\n\n【32】Keywords： Aneurysm， False·Angiography， Digital Subtraction· Embolization， Therapeutic ·\n\n【33】Radiology， Interventional·Tomography Scanners， X-Ray Computed\n\n【34】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/929013\n\n【35】品22549 山： 24\n\n【36】Segmental arterial mediolysis (SAM) is a rare vascular disease of the medium-sized and large-sized abdominal splanchnic arteries， characterized by stenoses， fusiform aneurysm， dis sections， and occlusions of the vessels involved \\[1\\]. SAM is a vascular pathology affecting mainly middle-aged and elderly patients， with an incidence of 1 out of 100 000 inhabitants per year. From the first cases described by Gruenwald in 1949 in a newborn with coronary arteries involvement \\[2\\]， Slavin and Gonzales-Vitale in 1976 studied artery histopathologic features of patients with abdominal muscular arteritis， dissecting an-eurysms and arterial luminal occlusion， defining a new histo-pathological entity in segmental arterial mediolysis \\[3\\]. Today， more than 100 cases have been reported in the literature \\[4\\]. However， the prevalence of SAM may be higher due to increased use of computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and magnet-ic resonance imaging (MRI) in recent years \\[5\\]. This allows ear-ly detection of vascular morphological alterations of the ves-sels affected and guides the correct management of this rare pathology， mainly in asymptomatic patients. Pathophysiology\n\n【37】and histological alterations begin with the “mediolysis pro-cess” which consists of non-inflammatory degeneration and lysis of the smooth muscle laver of the outer media of the ar-terial wall. The etiology of SAM is unknown， but an association with episodes of splanchnic hypoxia and vasoconstriction ob-served in multiple medical conditions such as shock， trauma， recent major surgery， vasopressorinfusion drugs， has been de scribed \\[6\\]. Recent studies also reported dysregulation of the peripheral nervous system and stimulation of adrenergic re-ceptors， mainly in young patients \\[1\\]. SAM is an uncommon cause of spontaneous intra-abdominal bleeding in middle-aged patients. However， the broad spectrum of symptoms varies from asymptomatic forms (often diagnosed incidentally after CT or MRI) to catastrophic clinical presentations mainly due to aneurysmal rupture and subsequent massive hemorrhage\\[7\\]. Bleeding may occur into the peritoneum or the bowel lu-men， and related symptoms include abdominal and flank pain， which are the most common symptoms， often associated with hematochezia or vomiting and diarrhea. Signs and symptoms of hypovolemic or hemorrhagic shock with a drop of hemoglo-bin and hematocrit levels are typical of severe forms. Bowel\n\n【38】Figure 1. Case 1.

(D) Coronal-CT image after angiographic treatment with coil embolization reveals the presence of an area of infarction in the upper pole of the spleen， without clinical and laboratory sequelae.\n\n【39】Figure 2. Case 1. (A-D) Multiplanar-CT reconstructions (MPR) show multiple alterations of splanchnic vessels， such as a right renal artery mimic a fibromuscular dysplasia aspect (open arrow in A)， a 'string of beads' appearance of the left gastric artery(white arrow in B-D)， right gastroepiploic artery， and anastomotic arcades of the middle colic artery and left colic artery and ileal and jejunal branches from the superior mesenteric artery (white arrowheads).\n\n【40】ischemia， renal involvement with hematuria， headaches， and stroke symptoms and coronary artery diseases are also report-ed \\[8，9\\]. The suspicion of SAM is also based on the exclusion of other clinical conditions， such as traumatic， infectious， in-flammatory， or systemic diseases and genetic disorders. SAM has a mortality rate as high as 50% when a rupture of a vis-ceral artery aneurysm occurs \\[10\\]； therefore， early diagnosis and treatment are mandatory to improve the outcome and sur-vival of these patients. We present 2 different cases admitted to the Emergency Department due to acute onset of abdomi-nal pain in patients with a drop in hemoglobin levels and CTA evidence of aneurysmatic and stenotic alterations of splanch-nic arteries. The patients were treated with super-selective transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE). For these 2 case re-ports， we used noninvasive diagnostic criteria for the diagno-sis of SAM based on clinical evaluation (absence of genetic，\n\n【41】inflammatory， infectious or atherosclerotic disorders)， radio-logical features (presence of arterial dissection， fusiform aneu-rysm， arterial wall thickening， focal stenosis)， laboratory find-ings (absence of high antibody values， antinuclear antibodies， antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies， inflammatory markers) and exclusion of other medical conditions.\n\n【42】Case Report\n\n【43】Case 1\n\n【44】An 89-year-old woman affected by cholelithiasis， vascular de-mentia， and hypertension (treated with hypotensive drugs -Ca++blockers) was admitted to the Emergency Department due to an episode of lipothymia， fatigue， and acute onset of\n\n【45】Figure 3.

Clinical examination revealed hypo-sthenia of the upper left arm， fever (38C)，vomiting，abdominal tenderness in the upper quadrants， with associated pain during deep palpation. Cardiovascular parameters were altered， with hypotension (blood pressure values： 100/60 mmHg)， heart rate of 95 bpm， and drop of laboratory hemoglobin values (Hb 10.5gr/dl). Hyperglycemia (Hemo Gluco Test： 190 mg/dl) was also present. Oxygen saturation was normal (95%). There were no clinical features of infection. CTA revealed direct signs of ac-tive bleeding fed by the gastroduodenal artery and splenic ar-tery， with peritoneal blood collection (hemoperitoneum) in the posterior right subhepatic space (Morison pouch)， perisplenic space， and rectouterine space (pouch of Douglas). Multiple al-terations of splanchnic vessels were also detected. CTA showed stenosis of the origin of the celiac trunk. Furthermore， aneurys matic dilatations involved a distal branch of the splenic artery(axial dimension of 6 mm)， right renal artery， right gastroep-iploic artery (axial dimension of 8 mm)， and the anastomotic arcades of the middle colic artery and left colic artery (Riolan's arch). These vessels on CTA showed a'string of beads'appear-ance (Figures 1， 2). Thus， the patient was urgently referred for endovascular treatment to our interventional unit (a University second-level hospital) after the failure of medical therapy. Vital parameters were in the normal range and the patient was transferred to the angiographic room. Superficial anesthesia with lidocaine hydrochloride (1-2%) was performed and vas-cular access was achieved through the right common femo-ral artery under ultrasound guidance and using a 5-Fr sheath. Then， a hydrophilic wire (Terumo 180 cm) and a Cobra C2-5 Fr shaped catheter， 80 cm in length， were inserted coaxially and the celiac trunk was catheterized. Diagnostic angiography doc-umented stenosis of the celiac trunk with post-stenotic tract\n\n【47】dilatation and aneurysmatic dilatation of an intraparenchy-mal branch of the splenic artery. Then， using a microcatheter-microwire system (Boston Scientific Direxion Transed System0.021 inchx130 cmx165 cm)， the splenic artery was negotiat-ed and a superior polar branch was embolized with 3 detach-able micro-coils (2 micro-coils of 3 mmx8 cm - Azur CX 18Detachable- and 1 micro-coil of 4 mmx13 cm-Azur CX 18Detachable). After coil embolization， occlusion of the patho-logical vessels was achieved (Figure 3). After the endovascu-lar procedure， clinical parameters (hemoglobin values， heart rate， oxygen saturation， blood pressure) and patient perfor-mance status improved and were maintained throughout her hospital stay. Four days later， subsequent radiological controls with CTA revealed the presence of an area of infarction of the upper pole of the spleen without clinical sequelae. Then， the patient was discharged in good clinical condition.\n\n【48】Case 2\n\n【49】A 52-year-old man， with a remote pathological diagnosis of hypertension treated with hypotensive drugs， was admitted to our Emergency Department for asthenia， sudden onset of ab-dominal pain， and diarrhea. The clinical examination revealed abdominal tenderness associated with pain during palpation， mainly in the upper abdominal quadrants. Blood pressure was110/70 mmHg， heart rate was 90 bpm， and laboratory hemo-globin values revealed anemia (Hb 9.8 gr/dl). Oxygen satu-ration was normal (95%). There were no clinical features of infection. A CTA was acquired， showing fat stranding in the peripancreatic space and vascular injury， with direct signs of active bleeding due to inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery pseudo-aneurysm formation. In this patient we observed an\n\n【50】Figure 4. Case 2. (A-C) Coronal-CT， three-dimensional reconstruction and axial-CT images show an inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery pseudo-aneurysm formation (white arrow) and fat stranding in the peripancreatic space， with an anatomical variant subtype consisting of an inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery (IPA) originating from an accessory right hepatic artery from the superior mesenteric artery (SMA).\n\n【51】anatomical variant subtype with the inferior pancreaticoduo denal artery (IPA) originating from an accessory right hepatic artery from the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) (Figure 4). The patient， without evidence of hemodynamic instability， was transferred to our Radiology Department； right common femo-ral artery access was achieved using a 5-Fr introducer sheath and the SMA was selectively catheterized using a Cobra C2 5-F shaped catheter， 100 cm in length and a hydrophilic wire sys-tem (Terumo 260 cm). Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) of the SMA was performed， detecting a pseudo-aneurysmat-ic formation with active bleeding of the IPA. A microcatheter-microwire system (Boston Scientific Direxion Transend 0.021inchx130 cmx165 cm) was inserted coaxially and the IPA was super-selectively catheterized and embolized with 2 detach-able micro-coils (2 mmx4 cm， Azur CX 18 Detachable). The fi-nal angiographic check demonstrated total occlusion of the target vessel. Two days later， a second arteriography was nec-essary due to the drop of hemoglobin values of the patient. DSA， performed through super-selective arteriography using a microcatheter-microwire system (Boston Scientific Direxion\n\n【52】Hi-Flo 0.021 inchx155 cm)， showed further active bleeding from a branch of the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery， dis-tally to the previously embolized area (Figure 5). The target vessel was treated by placing another detachable micro-coil(2 mmx4 cm， Azur CX 18 Detachable). After the procedure， clinical parameters and laboratory values improved， with no further evidence of anemia.\n\n【53】In these 2 cases， total occlusion of the target vessel at final an-giographic control during procedures was considered a tech-nical success. Clinical success was evaluated by clinical， lab-oratory， and radiological findings for several hours after the procedure. We also evaluated the hemoglobin levels for 48 h after the procedure. Discontinuation of vasopressor medica-tions， normalization of blood pressure and heart rate， and sta-bilization of serum hemoglobin values suggested that active bleeding had clinically ceased. Procedure-related minor and major complications were analyzed and compared according to the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) classification \\[11\\]. In addition， blood and stool cultures were negative， as well as\n\n【54】Figure 5. Case 2.

The radiological and clinical findings argued against a diagnosis of Marfan， Gsell-Erdheim syndrome， and polyarteritis nodosa(exclusion of American Rheumatology Association's criteria). Then， the patients were managed with a strict clinical check-up and imaging follow-up with CTA at 6 and 12 months for the first year and then surveillance at 12-month intervals. The patients gave written informed consent for the publication of their case data and details.\n\n【56】Discussion\n\n【57】Although the first case was described 70 years ago， SAM is a little-known and often misdiagnosed pathology of the blood vessels， with a broad spectrum of clinical presentations varying\n\n【58】from asymptomatic forms to life-threatening conditions. The exact etiology of SAM is still unknown； however， its histolog-ical features are widely described. Medium-sized arteries are the main structures involved， with a dynamic pathological pro-cess， called mediolysis， leading to irreversible alterations of the medial layer of the arterial wall. The mediolysis pathological process leads to progressive loss of the external elastic lamina， resulting in separation of the outer medial muscle layer from the adventitia in a focal area or in the entire circumference of the vessel. The breach between the internal elastic lamina and the intima layer causes an area of weakness where blood can enter and determines aneurysmatic alterations and ves-sel dissection with subsequent intramural hematoma \\[12，13\\]. The dissecting hematoma may also compromise the vessel lu-men and cause repair process and fibrosis. These alterations lead to stenoses and thrombosis of the arteries， resulting in ischemic manifestations. The most commonly involved ves-sels are the celiac trunk and its branches (in about 70-80% of\n\n【59】cases)， the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries and their branches (in about 10-15% of cases)， and other visceral ar-teries (in about 5% of cases) \\[1，15\\]. The natural history is un-predictable and SAM can evolve over time， remain stable for several months， or suddenly deteriorate with the extension of the pathology to other vascular segments. The early detection of SAM is important to improve the prognosis after the first occurrence \\[16\\]. Diagnosis and management of SAM are very complex since the heterogeneous clinical forms of presenta-tion with multiple visceral arteries involvement and parenchy-mal alterations make it a challenge for physicians. Histological examination of lesions is the criterion standard for diagnosis， but it is usually too invasive for patients. Furthermore，inter-ventional therapy does not allow collecting tissue during the same endovascular procedure. Histological tissue samples in other anatomical regions (superficial arteries) are often not examined because the patient’s condition does not allow a more invasive diagnostic procedure. Given the characteris-tic discontinuity of vascular lesions， the risk of obtaining a nondiagnostic tissue sample in other vascular areas is high. Kalva et al used noninvasive diagnostic criteria derived from a literature review，considering that it was too invasive to ob-tain pathologic tissue with high clinical suspicion of SAM and after ruling out alternative diagnoses \\[17，18\\]. However， labora-tory data are often normal and not specific for the pathology. Patients often have no signs of inflammatory conditions， and blood and stool cultures are negative for infectious diseases. Then， a correct clinica! and radiological examination and the exclusion of other causes of arteriopathies， such as system-ic diseases and genetic disorders， are the key points to guide the correct diagnosis and management of this disease. CTA is the criterion standard to assess splanchnic arteries and pa-renchymal-related alterations and it reveals patterns compati-ble with SAM \\[19\\]. Furthermore， CTA provides high spatial res-olution and shows the detailed anatomy of vessels and their alterations. Naidu et al showed the importance of using CTA to assess radiological findings and disease progression in a review of 111 patients with SAM \\[20\\]. The main radiological characteristics are dissecting aneurysms (distribution tends to spare bifurcations)， and patients often have CT scans show-ing intraperitoneal hemorrhage； radiological findings also in-clude a 'string of beads' pattern， characterized by arterial dila-tations， single or multiple visceral aneurysms， arterial stenosis， or arterial occlusions. The absence of vessel inflammation is typical of SAM. Due to the nonspecific clinical presentation， SAM can mimic different pathologies and conditions， includ-ing atherosclerosis alterations， systemic inflammatory vascu-litis such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis，polyarteritis no-dosa， eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis， Kawasaki disease or Takayasu's arteritis， mycotic aneurysm， cystic medi-al necrosis (in patients with Marfan Syndrome)， fibromuscular dysplasia， and infectious processes. Epidemiological， labora-tory， histology， and radiological findings need to be carefully\n\n【60】analyzed and integrated to obtain the correct diagnosis and to guide the treatment \\[21，22\\]. The natural history of SAM is unpredictable and requires continued surveillance over sev-eral years. SAM can be a life-threatening condition if the clin-ical presentation is severe (a hemorrhage can lead to sig nificant mortality) and if treatment is delayed. However， no formal guidelines and standardized clinical practices exist for the treatment of SAM. The management depends mainly on clinical symptoms and severity and extent of the alterations of vessels involved. Conservative medical therapy may be the first choice in patients with no symptoms and without signs of rapid evolution of pathology. In these patients， blood pressure control， lifestyle modifications， and conservative medical ther-apy with antiplatelet and hypotensive drugs are recommend-ed. Close monitoring of vessel alterations with CTA is strongly recommended based on the literature. The monitoring of an-eurysms is also necessary， and elective angiographic interven-tion should be considered based on the dimensions and ra-diological signs of immediate rupture of vascular aneurysms. In the literature， patients with SAM and with clinical presen-tation of acute intra-abdominal spontaneous bleeding and drastic degradation of clinical performance were treated with2 different therapeutic approaches： surgical treatment and en-dovascular therapy \\[23，24\\]. When possible， TAE should be the first choice in patients with SAM. Endovascular management is a mini-invasive procedure with a low rate of periprocedural complications and lower procedural time with improved sur-vival in the acute presentations of segmental artery mediol-ysis. Surgery should be considered when TAE is not available or is contraindicated， or for the management of extensive oc-clusive or hemorrhagic events that cannot be readily treated with a mini-invasive approach.\n\n【61】Conclusions\n\n【62】Segmental arterial mediolysis is an uncommon condition in which endovascular therapy is a minimally invasive， safe， and reliable treatment. In these 2 rare cases， interventional radiolo-gists played a crucial role in performing timely super-selective transcatheter arterial embolization of pathological vessels re-solving intra-abdominal active bleeding. In this condition， pa-tients who are not promptly treated may experience severe clinical complications， with a poor prognosis. Furthermore， pa-tients with clinical and radiological characteristics of SAM are often elderly and have comorbidities that make invasive sur-gical therapy technically difficult or contraindicated. Therefore， considering the heterogeneity of vessels involvement leading to intra-abdominal bleeding in SAM patients， a minimally in-vasive endovascular management should be the first choice when available and in the absence of contraindications to re-solve a potential life-threatening medical condition.\n\n【63】1\\.

It is associated with a potent adverse effect profile； however， the effects of flecainide toxicity in the set-ting of a pacemaker have not been well described. We describe a unique case of flecainide toxicity secondary to acute kidney injury in the setting of a dual-chamber pacemaker， resulting in ventricular capture latency and intermittent failure to capture.\n\n【14】Case Report：\n\n【15】The patient was a 91-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation maintained in sinus rhythm on fle-cainide， who presented complaining of purple visual disturbances and syncope. She was found to be hypoten-sive and bradycardic， with a heart rate between 30 to 40 beats per minute. Lab work was notable for creatinine at 2.12 mg/dL A 12-lead ECG demonstrated atrial and ventricular pacing with severely widened QRS complex and a significant latency between the pacemaker ventricular spike and the ventricular capture. The pacemaker was interrogated， revealing a significant increase in ventricular threshold from 0.75 V at 0.5 ms at baseline to5.0 V at 1 ms to obtain consistent capture. After multiple boluses of lV sodium bicarbonate， the QRS acutely narrowed， latency interval improved， and consistent pacing capture was achieved. The flecainide level drawn on arrival was 3.09 mcg/mL.\n\n【16】Conclusions：\n\n【17】Flecainide increases the ventricular capture threshold for pacemakers. Toxicity in these patients may present with pacemaker ventricular capture latency or failure to capture.\n\n【18】MeSH Keywords：\n\n【19】Acute Kidney Injury· Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions·Flecainide·Pacemaker， Artificia\n\n【20】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/916370\n\n【21】1664 H山白\n\n【22】2\n\n【23】非2\n\n【24】21\n\n【25】Flecainide is a Vaughan-Williams class Ic antiarrhythmic agent used most commonly in the treatment of atrial fibrillation， atrial flutter， and supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias in patients without known structural or ischemic cardiac dis-ease \\[1，2\\]. As a class Ic agent， its primary mechanism of action is blockade of fast sodium channels， resulting in a reduction in myocardial conduction velocity and a negative inotropic ef-fect on the myocardium. Its primary action in atrial tissue is to prolong the effective refractory period (ERP)， demonstrat-ing use-dependence， resulting in a more pronounced effect as the heart rate increases \\[3\\]. Flecainide has a narrow ther-apeutic window and a highly variable plasma half-life in the setting of renal dysfunction. A mortality rate of 10-25% has been reported with class Ic antiarrhythmic agent toxicity \\[4\\]. Although flecainide toxicity is described in the literature on acute kidney injury， there is a paucity of literature on the acute presentation of flecainide toxicity in the setting of a cardiac pacemaker \\[5\\]. We describe a case of flecainide toxicity sec-ondary to acute kidney injury in the setting of dual-chamber pacing， resulting in ventricular capture latency and intermit-tent failure to capture \\[6\\].\n\n【26】Case Report\n\n【27】The patient was a 91-year-old female with a history of parox-ysmal atrial fibrillation maintained in normal sinus rhythm on flecainide for more than 3 years. She also had sick sinus syn-drome， with a dual-chamber pacemaker placed many years prior， COPD， and heart failure with preserved ejection frac-tion. The patient presented for the first time to the Emergency Department (ED) complaining of nausea， lightheadedness， and generalized weakness. The patient's medication list was no-table for the use of flecainide 100 mg BID and metoprolol tar-trate 50 mg BID. A recent transthoracic echocardiogram had been performed a few months prior and had demonstrated a normal ejection fraction， concentric left ventricular hyper-trophy， and biatrial enlargement. The patient had recently un-dergone a total right knee replacement for degenerative joint disease 4 weeks prior， and post-operative ly the patient had de-veloped these symptoms along with poor oral intake. The pa-tient's creatinine was noted to be elevated at 2.09 compared to her baseline normal renal function. The patient was briefly admitted for acute kidney injury，re-hydrated with intravenous fluids， and discharged home without change in medications.\n\n【28】A few days later， the patient developed worsening fatigue and lightheadedness with several episodes of syncope. She also reported new visual disturbances with purple discoloration. She presented again to the ED and was found to be hypo-tensive， tachypneic， mildly encephalopathic， and bradycardic\n\n【29】with a heart rate of 30-40 beat per minute (bpm). A 12-lead ECG demonstrated atrial and ventricular pacing with severely widened QRS complex (QRS duration >200 ms) with a signif-icantly latency between the pacemaker ventricular spike and the ventricular capture. Metabolic studies were remarkable for an ongoing elevation in creatinine at 2.12 with a GFR of23 mL/min per 1.73 m²and a lactate of 3.8 mmol/L with a po-tassium level at the upper limit of normal.\n\n【30】The patient's dual-chamber pacemaker was emergently inter-rogated and found to be intermittently capturing in the ven-tricle. The ventricular threshold during device interrogation indeed revealed a significant increase from 0.75 V at 0.5 ms at baseline to 5.0 V at 1 ms to obtain consistent capture， even though a significant latency persisted， as noted earlier(Figure 1A). The patient was in complete heart block with no ventricular escape， as demonstrated by the pacemaker intra-cardiac electrograms (Figure 2). Due to concern for suspected flecainide toxicity， she was given IV sodium bicarbonate and a norepinephrine drip was started for initial hemodynamic sup-port. After multiple boluses of l sodium bicarbonate， the QRS acutely narrowed， pacemaker latency interval improved，and consistent pacing capture was achieved， although the paced QRS remained abnormally prolonged (Figure 1B). The patient’s cardiogenic shock secondary to bradycardia rapidly resolved. Two days later， the paced QRS complex duration became nar-rower， similar to baseline (Figure 1C).\n\n【31】The flecainide level drawn on arrival was 3.09 mcg/mL (refer-ence range： 0.20-0.99 mcg/mL). A few days later， the intrinsic atrioventricular conduction resumed. The electrolytes remained in the normal range throughout the hospitalization. The pa-tient's acute kidney injury resolved and she was discharged home. Flecainide was discontinued and the patient was contin-ued on metoprolol tartrate for control of her atrial fibrillation.\n\n【32】Discussion\n\n【33】We describe a case of a patient with a pacemaker who pre-sented with flecainide toxicity， in cardiogenic shock， with un-stable bradycardia， and increased ventricular threshold and la-tency， leading to intermittent ventricular capture. Flecainide has a potent adverse effect profile. The medication has a steep dose-response curve and has been recognized as having a nar-row therapeutic index \\[7\\]. Flecainide toxicity can result in nau-sea， vomiting， visual disturbances， and seizure \\[8\\]. In line with this， our patient presented with nausea， fatigue， pre-syncope， and visual disturbances. Like other antiarrhythmic agents， fle-cainide has pro-arrhythmic properties， particularly at serum levels greater than >1 mcg/mL and in patients with struc-tural or ischemic cardiac disease \\[9\\]. Along with dose-depen-dent prolongation of the PR interval and widening ofthe QRS\n\n【34】Figure 1. (A) 12-lead ECG performed after the pacemaker was switched into VVI mode at a pacing threshold of 5 mV at 1 ms. Note the impressive latency between the ventricular spike and the ventricular depolarization and the QRS duration above 200 ms. (B) 12-lead ECG performed after treatment with intravenous sodium bicarbonate， demonstrating improvement of the QRS duration and disappearance of the latency interval. (C) 12-lead ECG performed a day later， demonstrating a ventricular paced rhythm with a QRS narrower than that before ECG.\n\n【35】Figure 2. Intracardiac electrograms from the initial pacemaker interrogation， demonstrating no ventricular escape at 40 bpm.\n\n【36】complex， it has been reported that ventricular tachyarrhyth-mia， high-grade AV block， and bundle branch block are asso-ciated with flecainide toxicity \\[8\\].\n\n【37】In our patient， the QRS complex was found to be severely wid-ened on presentation， with a duration greater than 200 ms and intermittent ventricular capture due to increased thresh-old. Flecainide toxicity results in rate-dependent QRS complex widening by competitive inhibition of the Nav1.5 cardiac so-dium channels， which results in a slowing of the phase 0 por-tion of the cardiac action potential \\[10\\].\n\n【38】A unique feature of this case is a dual-chamber pacemaker pa-tient becoming pacemaker-dependent， with acute flecainide toxicity， and subsequently developing syncope due to ventric-ular capture latency and intermittent failure to capture. It has been demonstrated that flecainide can increase the ventricular capture threshold for pacemakers， and patients at therapeutic doses may require pacemaker setting adjustment when initi-ating flecainide \\[11\\]. However， pacemaker failure to capture in the setting of acute flecainide toxicity has seldom been re-ported in the literature \\[5\\]. Our case also demonstrates a pro-longed pacemaker latency interval in the setting of flecainide toxicity and subsequent rapid improvement in latency interval after treatment with intravenous sodium bicarbonate， which has not been previously reported. Along with elevated capture thresholds， the ECG findings in this case were the result of the device attempting to pace while the myocardium was in an extended refractory period secondary to flecainide. The intrin-sic function of the device itself was normal. Adjustment of the pacemaker settings to optimize pacing capture and prompt rec-ognition that this was not “device failure\" were important in rapid resolution and minimization of morbidity in this patient.\n\n【39】Sodium bicarbonate is a well described therapy for flecainide toxicity. It has been demonstrated that both alkalization and increased sodium concentration reverse flecainide effects on Purkinje fibers in animal models. This may be caused by ac-celerating flecainide molecule dissociation from the sodium channel receptor and by competitive inhibition， but the mech-anism is not fully understood \\[12\\]. In our patient， prompt so-dium bicarbonate administration resulted in rapid resolution of the patient's device failure to capture and cardiogenic shock. Cardiac pacing has previously been described as a treatment for flecainide toxicity \\[13\\]. While it may be helpful when pa-tients present with complete heart block， our case and other cases described in the literature suggest that cardiac pacing may be of minimal benefit when the predominant issue is QRS widening \\[14，15\\]. Acidification of the urine has been shown to increase urinary excretion of flecainide， but there is little data available on its clinical role in the setting of flecainide toxicity， and it was not pursued in the treatment of this patient \\[16\\].\n\n【40】In the patient described， the etiology of flecainide toxicity was an acute kidney injury， which has been recognized as a com-mon trigger. Flecainide is eliminated from the body by renal excretion and the hepatic cytochrome P450 CYP2D6 enzyme. The primary elimination mechanism is renal excretion and， in the setting of normal renal function， 80-90% of the drug is excreted into the urine \\[17\\]. In a patient with intact renal and hepatic function， the medication's plasma half-life is approxi-mately 12-26 hours. However， studies have demonstrated that the medication has a highly variable plasma half-life in the set-ting of renal dysfunction， and its usage requires caution and dose adjustment in these circumstances \\[18\\]. An initial maxi-mum oral dosage of 100 mg daily is typically recommended in patients with moderate to severe renal failure (creatinine clear-ance <35 ml/min) \\[19\\]. Importantly， flecainide cannot be re-moved with the use of hemodialysis. Furthermore， lower doses should be considered in elderly patients， as in our case. Some authors recommend altogether avoiding class I antiarrhyth-mic agents in very elderly patients due to their adverse effect profile \\[20\\]. Flecainide particularly must be used with caution in these patients due to the high probability of undiagnosed coronary artery disease. Flecainide also has a known nega-tive inotropic effect and has been associated with increased mortality in heart failure patients， particularly among patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction \\[21\\]. Although data are scarce regarding the use of flecainide in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction， we believe fle-cainide should be used with caution in these patients as well.\n\n【41】Conclusions\n\n【42】Flecainide is a class Ic antiarrhythmic agent with a narrow therapeutic index and a potent adverse effect profile. Ourre-port describes a unique case of flecainide toxicity in a pace-maker-dependent patient. This case illustrates several impor-tant points regarding the treatment of patients with flecainide toxicity. When treating patients that have renal dysfunction and older patients with flecainide， physicians should exercise caution. Patients with acute kidney injury should have their medication discontinued or at least reduced until resolution. Particular care should be practiced when treating patients on flecainide，even when they are not pacemaker-dependent， as it is associated with the risk of iatrogenic complete heart block and risk of pacemaker failure to capture due to elevated myo-cardial capture thresholds. This could be more dramatic for pa-tients that are pacemaker-dependent. Sodium bicarbonate is an effective therapy for flecainide toxicity.\n\n【43】1\\.

Seborrheic dermatitis may affect adults and infants in the rich in sebaceous glands areas such as the face， chest， back and head area. Aim This study aims to describe the species of Malassezia species found in pityriasis Versicolor and seborrheic dermatitis in Dr Wahidin Sudirohusodo general hospital and its network hospitals Makassar in 2018. Method A cross-sectional study was performed on 29 patients of pityriasis Versicolor， and 40 patients with seborrheic dermatitis who came for treatment at Dr Wahidin Sudirohusodo general hospital and its network hospital in Makassar by Nested PCR examination of scale specimens scraped from both groups of patients with each primer to identify species of Malassezia species. Frequency distribution test was conducted by Fisher’s exact test. Results The results showed29 patients pityriasis Versicolor and 40 patients seborrheic dermatitis. Of the three species of Malassezia (M.globosa， M.furfur， M.restricta)， with Nested PCR examination， only 14 cases of M. restricta were found in pityriasis Versicolor patients (48.3%) and 31 cases of seborrheic dermatitis (77.5%). M. furfur and M.globosa were not found in both groups of patients. Conclusions and Recommendations M.restricta was found on seborrheic dermatitis， and its prevalence is more significant than its finding on pityriasis Versicolor. Therefore， antifungals should be considered to be given to patients with seborrheic dermatitis.\n\n【4】KEYWORDS： Seborrheic Dermatitis； Malassezia；Nested-PCR； Pityriasis Versicolor.\n\n【5】Copyright @ 2019 by the Bulgarian Association of Young Surgeons DOI：10.5455/JMRCR.detection-malassezia-pityriasis-versicolor-seborrheic-dermatitis-nested-pcr First Received： April 30， 2018\n\n【6】Accepted： May 02，2018\n\n【7】Manuscript Associate Editor： Ivan Inkov (BG)\n\n【8】1Andi Nurhana， Department of Dermatology and Venereology， Faculty of Medicine，\n\n【9】Hasanuddin University，Makassar， Indonesia Email；nurhana7272@gmail.com\n\n【10】Malassezia is a normal flora which commonly situated on the skin. Hence in some cases，Malassezia might reproduce in large quantities resulting in disease. Malassezia belongs to lipophilic and or lipid-dependent groups. This yeast habitat is the skin of humans and other warm-blooded animals. Found in 90% of healthy adult skin， this organism can change its state of sapro-phyte into a pathogen under the influence of predisposing fac-tors， such as changes in skin microflora and or changes in host\n\n【11】Malassezia species may cause pityriasis Versicolor and are associated with the pathogenesis of skin disorder such as seb-orrheic dermatitis， atopic dermatitis， and recent finding shows their involvement in the occurrence of psoriasis. Pityriasis Ver-sicolor was first observed in 1801 by Willan. In 1889， Baillon suggested that the Malassezia genus was the cause of pityriasis Versicolor.2\\]\n\n【12】Previous study done in Ahvaz Iran shows that most species involved in pityriasis Versicolor and seborrheic dermatitis were M. furfur (51.3%) and M. restricta (65.2%)， other species such as M. globosa (35.2%) and M. restricta (13.5%) were found in pityriasis Versicolor， and M. globosa (26.1%)， M. furfur (8.7%) were found in seborrheic dermatitis. We did not find any other species in this study.\\[1\\]\n\n【13】Pityriasis Versicolor (PV) is a superficial fungal infection caused by yeast and lipophilic fungi of the Malassezia genus， characterised by fine scaly patches (pityriasis)， hypochromic or hyperchromic (Versicolor)， and usually present in the neck， body and arms. Its infection might extend to face， groin and thigh.\\[3\\]\n\n【14】The study of several experts in various sites on the colonisa-tion of Malassezia species in PV patients showed varying results. This suggests a geographical variation in the prevalence of differ-ent Malassezia species in patients with pityriasis Versicolor.\\[4\\]\n\n【15】Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a chronic skin disorder com-monly affecting adults and infants. It is situated in the areas of the body with a high concentration of sebaceous follicles and ac-tive sebaceous glands including face， scalp， the upper part of the body， and the body folds (inguinal， inframammary， and axilla). Clinical features of them are pinkish to red plaque and superfi-cial spots with yellowish， and sometimes oily， scores. Seborrheic dermatitis is common in patients with infections of Human Im-munodeficiency Virus (HV) and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) as well as in neurological disorders， such as Parkinson's disease.\\[5\\]\n\n【16】PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) is an enzymatic method for DNA amplification by way of in vitro. Several significant com-ponents such as DNA mould， primary oligonucleotides，deoxyri-bonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP)， DNA polymerase enzymes， and buffering compounds are needed to do PCR. Nested-PCR is a replication technique of DNA samples using DNA polymerase enzymes which have two pairs of primers to amplify the frag-ments. Using Nested-PCR， any erroneous fragment amplified by the first primer might be amplified a second time by the second primer. Lim et al. (2008)， using Nested-PCR to identify Malassezia species in patients with seborrheic dermatitis.\\[6\\] Re-cent studies in Ahvaz， Iran， also identified dominant species in patients with pityriasis Versicolor and seborrheic dermatitis by using this method. The results of the dominant Malassezia species were M furfur followed by M. restricta.\\[1\\]\n\n【17】This study aimed to describe the species of Malassezia species found in pityriasis Versicolor and seborrheic dermatitis in Dr Wahidin Sudirohusodo general hospital and its network hospi-tals Makassar in 2018.\n\n【18】MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n【19】The study was conducted in the Division of Skin and Genitalia of Dr Wahidin Sudirohusodo general hospital and its network hospitals Makassar in 2018 including clinical determination of pityriasis Versicolor and seborrheic dermatitis. The Nested-PCR examination was performed at the Microbiology Laboratory of the Faculty of Medicine， Hasanuddin University.\n\n【20】This research is observational research conducted with cross-sectional approach. The research variables consist of the de-pendent variable (Malassezia species) and independent variable(pityriasis Versicolor and seborrheic dermatitis).\n\n【21】The population of the study was pityriasis Versicolor and seborrheic dermatitis patients treated in Skin and Genitalita clinic or inpatient of Dr.Wahidin Sudirohusodo general hospital and its network hospital Makassar in 2018. The samples of research are all patients who meet the criteria that are as many as 69 people consisting of 40 people with seborrheic dermatitis and 29 people with pityriasis Versicolor.\n\n【22】The subjects who met the criteria of the study sample were classified into two groups， such as PV and SD. Their skins were then collected by skin scraping after the skin lesions were cleansed with alcohol swabs. It was done by using a blunt scalpel to obtain scale， which was then accommodated on a glass object that has been passed on fire spiritus. The specimen was then inspected by using KOH. Hereafter， DNA of the Malassezia was isolated to be tested with Nested-PCR.\n\n【23】The data in this study was processed by computer statistical software using SPSS version 20. To test the analysis hypothesis， Chi-square test was used. The hypothesis is accepted when the value of P <0.05 with 95% confidence interval.\n\n【24】RESULTS\n\n【25】This study has 69 samples consisting of 40 people with sebor-rheic dermatitis and 29 people with pityriasis Versicolor who meets the inclusion criteria from Dr Wahidin Sudirohusodo gen-eral hospital and its network hospitals. The examination was done by taking into account the clinical manifestations to deter-mine the clinical diagnosis. Scale specimens were taken by scrap-ing it from the lesions of seborrheic dermatitis and pityriasis Versicolor patients. Nested-PCR then examined them performed to identify Malassezia species at Microbiology Laboratory of UNHAS Makassar Hospital. This study aims to determine the frequency or incidence of Malassezia species found in patients with seborrheic dermatitis and pityriasis Versicolor.\n\n【26】Characteristics of patients with seborrheic dermatitis and pityriasis Versicolor showed that there was a significant differ-ence in the age of seborrheic dermatitis patients with pityriasis Versicolor (p<0.05). Pityriasis Versicolor patients were found at younger ages (28.69±13.96 vs 45.88 ±9.32). No differences in sex distribution were found (p>0.05)； More men were found in both groups (Table 1).\n\n【27】The findings of Malassezia species in patients with sebor-rheic dermatitis and pityriasis Versicolor showed that M.restricta species were found in both groups， but no M. furfur and M.globosa species were found in both groups (Table 2).\n\n【28】X² test results showed a significant difference of M.restricta findings (p <0.05) between patients with seborrheic dermatitis compared to Pityriasis Versicolor. The findings of M.restricta in Seborrheic Dermatitis were higher than the findings of M. restricta on Pityriasis Versicolor (77.5% vs 48.3%) (Table 3).\n\n【29】Electrophoresis of PCR products in the sample group of patients with seborrheic dermatitis and pityriasis Versicolor showed positive predominance detecting M. restricta on tar-get band of 320 bp with CTTGGTTGGACCGTCACTG forward primer and AGGCGGATGCAAAGTGTCTC reverse primer.(Figure 1)\n\n【30】Table 1 Characteristics of patients with seborrheic dermatitis and pityriasis Versicolor\n\n| Characteristics  |  | Seborrheic Dermatitis(n=40)  | PityriasisVersikolor (n=29)  | The Value of P  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age (years)  | Min/Max  | 29/68  | 4/56  | <0，0001  |\n|  | Mean(SD)  | 45，88(9，32)  | 28，69(13，96)  | <0，0001  |\n| Gender  | Male；n(%)  | 27(67，5%)  | 21(724%)  | 0，863  |\n|  | Female； n (%)  | 13 (32，5%)  | 8(27，6%)  | 0，863  |\n| \\*independent sample t test； Continuity correction X2 test  |  |  |  |  |\n\n【32】Table 2 Malassezia species findings in patients with seborrheic dermatitis and pityriasis Versicolor\n\n| Malassezia Species  | SeborrheicDermatitis (n=40)  |  | PityriasisVersicolor (n=29)  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | N  | %  | n  | %  |\n| M.furfur  | 0  | 0.0%  | 0  | 0，0%  |\n| M.globosa  | 0  | 00%  | 0  | 0，0%  |\n| M.restricta  | 31  | 77，5%  | 14  | 48，3%  |\n\n【34】DISCUSSION\n\n【35】Seborrheic dermatitis is a skin condition with sub-acute or chronic inflammation， characterised by pruritus， oily erythe-matous plaque， yellowish-grey scores seen in rich in sebaceous glands areas such as the face， head， upper chest， and back. Seb-orrheic dermatitis accounts for about 3-5% of adult population， with a tendency to occur in men.\\[5，7\\]\n\n【36】The cause of seborrheic dermatitis is not yet known， hence some factors which play a role in its etiopathogenesis is the Malassezia species.\\[8\\] Recent clinical studies show that increased density of Malassezia has an important role in the pathogene-sis of seborrheic dermatitis.\\[9\\] Seborrheic dermatitis occurs in adolescence or young adulthood， with increased incidence in patients older than 50 years.8 In elderly patients， the reduced immune system made them more susceptible to various dis-eases such as seborrheic dermatitis. In Indonesia， retrospective research results from Malak et al. (2016)， shows the highest distribution for seborrheic dermatitis incidence was from 45-64years group in Manado.\\[10\\]\n\n【37】Figure 1： Nested-PCR examination results\n\n【38】In this study， the distribution of cases of seborrhoeic dermati-tis obtained on men was more than women. The number of men samples were 27 cases (67，5%) whereas women were only 13cases (32，5%). This is similar to previous research by Malak et al.(2016)， in Manado， the 61 cases were men (67.0%)， and 30 cases were women (33.0%). It is probably associated with higher an-drogen hormone stimulation in men than in women where this hormone has a function to produce sebum and enhance sebum activity which is one of the causes of seborrheic dermatitis.\\[10\\]\n\n【39】The study found M.restricta species， but no M. furfur and M.globosa species were found in both groups. The species of Malassezia detected in a positive sample of seborrheic dermati-tis was M. restricta. According to the literature， most studies\n\n| Clinical Diagnose  | M.restricta  |  |  |  | The Value of p  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Positive (n=45)  |  | Negative (n=24)  |  |  |\n| Seborrheic Dermatitis  | 31  | 77，5%  | 9  | 22，5%  | 0，024  |\n| Pityriasis versikolor  | 14  | 48，3%  | 15  | 51，7%  |  |\n\n【41】\\*Continuity Correction X2 test\n\n【42】智花雾显置泽显黑著售置质品智普碧配置智盟\n\n【43】Figure 1 (continued)\n\n【44】around the world show M. restricta as the dominant species in patients with seborrheic dermatitis. Research conducted by Lim et al (2008)， using the Nested-PCR method， and Lee et al (2011)， using the PCR-RFLP method to identify Malassezia species in patients with seborrheic dermatitis in Korea， obtained the results of dominant species such as M. restricta (47%) and M. furfur(27%).\\[6，11\\] Thus the results of this study are similar to those of previous researchers.\n\n【45】Cases of pityriasis Versicolor also found in more men than women. The number of men was 21 cases (72，4%) whereas women were only 8 cases (27，6%). Archana et al. (2015)， in Karnataka India also found PV incidence was more common in men (73%) than in women (27%). Gosh et al.， Rao et al.， and Krishnan et al. also found the tendency in men is likely to be influenced by outer activity in men.\\[12\\]\n\n【46】Based on Malassezia's findings in patients with seborrheic dermatitis and pityriasis Versicolor in this study showed that M.restricta species were found in both groups， but no M. furfur and M.globosa species were found in both groups. In 40 pa-tients with seborrheic dermatitis， 31 cases (77.5%) were positive M.restricta while 9 cases (22.5%) were negative. Whereas in 29patients of pityriasis Versicolor， 14 cases (48，3%) were positive M.restricta yet 15 cases (51，7%) were negative. In the previous study conducted by Mahmoudabadi et al. (2014)， in Ahvaz Iran， the Malassezia's finding in 30 patients with seborrheic dermati-\n\n【47】tis were 15 cases of M. restricta (65.2%)， 6 cases of M. globosa(26， 1%) and 2 cases of M. furfur (8.7%). In pityriasis Versi-color group， M.furfur was more common as they had 19 cases(51，3%)， 13 cases of M.globosa (35，2%) and 5 cases of M.restricta(13，5%) from 45 cases.\\[1\\]Malassezia which is the main cause of PV species seems to differ geographically. M. globose has been reported more prevalent in many countries with moderate tem-perature and Mediterranean climates such as Spain， Japan， Israel， northern India， Iran， Tunisia， Italy and Bosnia-Hercegovina. M. sympodialis is more common in subtropical countries such as Argentina，Brazil and South India except in Canada which has a moderate temperature. M. furfur has shown a clear dominance in tropical countries such as Indonesia， Thailand， Brazil and Venezuela.13\\]\n\n【48】In this study we found 4 cases of pityriasis Versicolor having10% positive potassium hydroxide (KOH) examination results， which was the discovery of \"spaghetti and meatballs\"， but no DNA of Malassezia species was found on the Nested-PCR ex-amination. This might due to the Nested-PCR primer which was specific to M.furfur， M.globosa and M. restricta， thus other species then those might not be detected.\n\n【49】CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n【50】We concluded that in pityriasis Versicolor patients， Malassezia restricta was the only species found with the prevalence of 48.3%， whereas M. furfur and M.globosa were not found. In seborrheic dermatitis patients， the only species found was Malassezia re-stricta with the prevalence of 77.5%， whereas M. furfur and M.globosa were not found. We also suggest that in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis， antifungal drugs， especially in recur-rent patients should be considered. Further research is needed by extending the type of primer used to identify other types of Malassezia with the appropriate number of samples.\n\n【51】Competing Interests\n\n【52】The authors declare no conflict of interest.\n\n【53】REFERENCES\n\n【54】1\\.

Additionally， patients suffer from the reduced duration of L-dopa response， dose failures and dose variability in response\\[1\\]. Pharmacological adjustments are usually unsatisfactory in controlling these motor complications， thus progressively com-promising quality of life \\[2\\]. Bilateral high-frequency stimulation of either subthalamic nucleus (STN) or globus pallidus interna(GPi) is one of the most effective procedures currently available for alleviating the disabling motor symptoms and complications in advanced PD. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of both targets improves tremor， limb rigidity， bradykinesia and akinesia \\[3，4\\]. In this paper， we will review the current pharmacological and surgical treatment options in an advanced stage of PD， empha-sizing the contribution of new perspectives of physical therapies on motor functioning that enhance positive impacts of medical and surgical treatments.\n\n【16】Clinicians define advanced PD as stage 4 and five on the Hoehn and Yahr scale which means the onset of motor complications， despite aggressive pharmacological and behavioural manage-ment \\[5\\]. In this stage， patients may notice a decline in motor benefit several hours after the last dose of L-dopa (“end of dose deterioration\"or \"wearing off phenomenon\"). Several potential mechanisms collectively lead to a narrow therapeutic window where low plasma and striatal levels of dopaminergic drugs will lead to “off\" periods and high levels will lead to choreiform involuntary movements emerging within 1-2 hours after L-dopa intake (“peak-dose dyskinesia\"). Later， dyskinesias may also occur at the onset and offset of motor benefit (“diphasic dyski-nesias\"). It has been estimated that motor complications occur50% of patients by five years of disease \\[6\\]. In later stages of PD， patients who suffer from motor complications usually need assistance for most of their daily activities such as feeding， per-sonal hygiene， dressing， turning in bed， rising from the seating position and walking. Moreover， gait disturbances， especially“freezing of gait\" and postural instability are more frequent in the advanced stage that leads to frequent falls and increases the risk fractures.\n\n【17】Medical management of motor complications\n\n【18】In the management of motor complications，neurologists should first focus on the optimization of dopaminergic drugs and issues like drug absorption， timing， dosages and pharmacokinetic and delivery changes should be reevaluated. For instance， a protein-rich diet can lead to delaved absorption of L-dopa， and this can be improved by taking the pills one half to one hour before meals \\[7\\]. Fractionating the daily L-dopa dose into smaller， more frequent doses and administering liquid L-dopa formulations can increase drug absorption as well， and reduce “off\" period and peak dose dyskinesias \\[8\\]. Amantadine (100-300mg/day) may also help to suppress peak-dose dyskinesias. Wearing off symptoms are usually managed by combining L-dopa with a catechol-o-methyltransferase inhibitor (entacapone)， a dopamin-ergic agonist or an MAO-B inhibitor (selegiline). Another option is adding a slow release L-dopa preparation especially at bed-time can help to relieve nocturnal akinesia and early morning dystonia.\n\n【19】Most of the time manipulating the oral drug regimen is enough to manage motor fluctuations and dyskinesia， but in some PD patients， severe motor fluctuations and peak dose dyskinesias make it necessary to use alternative routes of drug deliver or consider DBS surgery. Continuous dopaminergic stim-ulation with subcutaneous apomorphine injections can help to reduce daily “off\"periods of about 50%， but side effects， like hypotension and skin nodules， can be troublesome. Another alternative route of L-dopa delivery is achieved by percutaneous gastrostomy (PEG). This system directly delivers concentrated gel preparations of L-dopa-carbidopa (Duodopa \\[Solvay Phar-maceuticals， Hannover， Germany\\]) into jejunum and can help to reduce motor complications by attaining more stable plasma L-dopa levels.\n\n【20】Surgical management of motor complications\n\n【21】Unfortunately， as the disease progress， therapeutic benefit win-dow gradually narrows and patients are severely disabled due to frequent and severe shifts between “off\" periods and “on”periods with peak-dose dyskinesias. In recent years DBS has\n\n【22】become an critical symptomatic treatment in the management of dopamine resistant tremor and motor fluctuations due to long-term dopaminergic treatment. Ten to 20% of PD patients are eligible for deep brain stimulation \\[9\\]. The significant benefits of DBS are to smooth motor fluctuations and dyskinesia who does not achieve satisfactory symptom control with optimized medical therapy； patients with medically refractory tremor； who are intolerant of dopaminergic drugs； or the patients with a com-bination of these issues should be considered for DBS surgery. However， the presences of significant cognitive impairment， refractory psychiatric or medical co-morbidities are the main contraindications for DBS and may influence the decision to pro-ceed. There are several available surgical methods. In the most common method， DBS surgery is performed in two stages. After the patient's preparations have been completed， the stereotactic frame is placed on the head under local anaesthesia. The patients are transferred to the computed tomography (CT)scanning or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suite for image acquisition and then to the operation room for the surgery. The target-ing is based on magnetic resonance images (MRI) or merged with CT. Then， neurosurgeons plan the target coordinates and lead trajectory. The subthalamic nucleus (STN)，globus pallidus interna (GPi)， the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN)， zona in-certa and ventro-intermediate nucleus (Vim) are five possible targets chosen (10). These structures play critical roles in the control of movement. Patients are positioned for surgery in the head holder. After a standard incision， burr holes， trajectory， macroelectrode and microelectrode recordings for targets are performed； then， the DBS electrode is inserted in the awake patient who had satisfactory improvement of symptoms and an adequate threshold for side effects such as strength， vision， and improvement of motor function. The process is repeated on the other hemisphere. In the second stage， the same day following the electrode implantation， the lead cable connectors and IPG are placed under general anaesthesia. DBS compli-cations may be divided into risks associated with the surgical procedure and chronic complications of therapy that may or may not be device related \\[10\\]. The most severe complications of DBS surgery are stroke (0.9%)， intracerebral haemorrhage (1.2%)， seizure (1.2%)， hardware-related complications such as device infection (4.4%)，lead fracture (3.8%)， skin erosion， and device migration or misplacement (3.2%)， and the risks vary from study to study depending on many factors \\[11， 12\\]. These risks may be somewhat attenuated by appropriate screening and treat-ment of comorbid conditions， including hypertension， which increases hemorrhage risk during microelectrode recording； dia-betes， which increases the risk of infection； psychiatric disease， which increases the risk of depression and suicide； cognitive deficits， which increase the risk of postoperative confusion； and obesity or other significant cardiopulmonary diseases， which may increase the general risk of surgery \\[11\\].\n\n【23】Physiotherapy and rehabilitation\n\n【24】In recent years physical therapy focusing on gait and balance gained more importance. Interesting new perspectives are forth-coming on motor functioning to enhance the positive impacts of DBS. Physical therapies combined with DBS can help to pre-serve an appropriate level of activity， treat specific disabilities and establish new movement patterns.\n\n【25】Functional disorders caused by clinical symptoms lead to de-terioration in activities of daily living and quality of life， depend-ing on the severity of the disease. The physiotherapy program\n\n【26】Fig.1. Therapeutic process.\n\n【27】Fig.2. Physical therapy assessment and rehabilitation program in post-operative phase.\n\n【28】to be applied according to the needs of the patient in different phases of Parkinson's disease will also vary. Information about the treatment process of patients at different stages is summa-rized in Figure 1 28\\].\n\n【29】Physiotherapy approaches， including exercise programs， play an essential role in the treatment of Parkinson's disease \\[291. Increasingly， exercise programs have been shown to be highly effective in reducing functional deficits \\[30)\\] The most important goal of the rehabilitation program is to increase the mobility and functional capacity of the patient， to increase the quality of life， and to make social life return by increasing the level of independence. Physiotherapy and rehabilitation programs should not only aim to treat the functions that are impaired but also to prevent the problems that will arise. Beginning the physiotherapy program concurrently with the treatment of the disease from the early stages of the disease may help to avoid such problems that lead to dependence， inactivity， social isolation and reduced quality of life \\[31\\].\n\n【30】1\\. Preoperative Phase The aim of physiotherapy and rehabil-itation in the preoperative stage is to prepare the patients who are undergoing DBS. The goal of physical therapy pro-gram are； improve the respiratory function and to prevent respiratory complications， decrease rigidity， reduce the pain， maintain independence， improve the flexibility； optimize gait， to recommended assistive devices， maximize gross mo-tor coordination and balance， provide the safe ambulation， educate and guide caregiving needs \\[32， 33\\].\n\n【31】The first step of preoperative evaluation is to inform the patient and his/her family about the possible complications of the surgeon. The evaluation procedure to be performed before determining the appropriate rehabilitation program for the patient includes balance， mobility， tremor， rigidity， coordination， speech， evaluation of hand functions， activ-\n\n【32】ities of daily living， environmental assessment， assistive device selection 34\\].\n\n【33】2\\. Postoperative Phase After surgery， patients are assessed at first 24 hours following the battery setting. Parkinson’s dis-ease has a respiratory failure due to flexure posture，kypho-sis and rigidity. After surgery， physiotherapy begins with breathing exercises. Respiratory exercises， postural align-ment exercises， and upper body extension exercises are effective for increasing respiratory capacity \\[34， 35\\]. Post-operative evaluation and physiotherapy program to be per-formed are given in Figure 2.\n\n【34】To reduce postural disturbance and balance problems，the patient should be taught the correct posture. Postural ex-tension exercises and trunk rotation movements should be applied. To prevent falls， the patient should be instructed to rotate around a large arc by correctly positioning the foot and increasing visual and verbal stimuli， while walk-ing. Walking with a rhythm and proper walking with arm swings should be taught to prevent freezing \\[34， 35k. in Parkinsonian patients， speech problems are seen as a re-sult of the fact that the respiratory frequency cannot be controlled at first， but later on， facial muscles are affected. Respiratory exercises， facial， oral and lingual muscle exer-cises should be performed to prevent aspiration by speech therapy and to ensure speech correctness \\[34\\]. The steps of the rehabilitation program that will occur after surgery are explained in detail in Figure 3 \\[28\\].\n\n【35】3\\. Recommendations for patients and family. Frequent rest periods should be given during exercises； excessive fatigue should be avoided.\n\n【36】The activities that patients should not do after surgery are as follows：\n\n【37】·Cervical manipulation， massage and excessive cervical ex-ercise should be avoided.\n\n【38】Upper limb activities above the head level should not be done.\n\n【39】·Do not lift more than 3-4 kg in the first month.\n\n【40】· Some medical devices such as MRI should not be used.\n\n【41】·Do not pass through electromagnetic gates.\n\n【42】·Wireless connections are dangerous for battery.\n\n【43】·Stay away from high-powered industrial machines.\n\n【44】· Simple sportive activities can be carried out， especially those that are not physically risky to crash and without contact with the tie or neuro-stimulator.\n\n【45】Rehabilitation practices should continue lifelong in Parkinson’s disease. In this regard， directing patients to activities such as walking and dancing to improve aerobic capacities will facilitate the maintenance of the rehabilitation program \\[36\\]. Patient and family should be made aware. The exercises and suggestions should be given as a home program， for this purpose \\[36，37\\].\n\n【46】Discussion\n\n【47】DBS surgery will potentially benefit only symptoms that are lev-odopa responsive \\[11\\]. However， the patients who have typical PD with tremor， dyskinesias， and wearing-off spells are a good candidate for DBS.DBS can improve“on\" time， reduce on-off fluctuations， and decrease levodopa-induced dyskinesias (direct suppressive effect or indirectly by allowing some reduction in\n\n【48】Table 1 Treatment strategies\n\n| Stimulation of activities  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Goal  | Strategy  |\n| Transfers  | Perform transfers (more) independently  | Practice transfers by using cognitive movement strategies and on/off cues for movement initiation  |\n| Body posture  | Conscious normalization of body posture  | Practice relaxed and coordinated moving； providing feedback and advice  |\n| Reaching and grasping  | Improve reaching and grasping， and manipulating and moving objects  | Practice reaching and grasping by using cues and cognitive movement strategies  |\n| Balance  | Improve balance during activities  | Practice balance， train muscle strength (see the prevention of falls)  |\n| Gait  | Improve walking (independently)； the objective is to increase the (comfortable)walking speed； however， safety comes first  | Practice walking by using cues for initiationand continuation of walking， give instruction and train muscle strength and trunk mobility  |\n| Prevention  |  |  |\n| Inactivity  | Preserve or improve physical condition  | Provide information on the importance of movingand playing sports， training of physical capacity；muscle strength (with the emphasis on trunkand leg muscles)； aerobic capacity； and joint mobility (among others thoracic kyphosis， axial rotation and length of muscles of calf and hamstrings).  |\n| Pressure Sores  | Prevention of pressure sores  | Give advice and adjust the patient’s bodyposture in bed or wheelchair (possibly in consultation with an occupational therapist)； (supervised) active exercises to improve cardiovascular condition and prevention of contractures  |\n| Falls  | Decrease or prevent falls  | List possible causes of falls using falls diary；provide information and advice； train strength， body posture， coordination and balance， attuned to the cause of problems with maintaining balance and the increased falls risk； decrease the fear to fall (if necessary) provide hip protectors.  |\n\n【50】medication dose)， but， with the exception of tremor， does not provide motor benefits that exceed the patient's best “on\"med-ication state (with the current available targets of STN or GPi)\\[11\\]. Symptoms that do not respond at all to levodopa usually do not improve significantly with DBS. Following DBS， there may be a reduction， but not elimination， of anti-Parkinsonian medications.\n\n【51】DBS of the STN and GPi have been shown to be the most effective brain targets. All cardinal symptoms including akine-sia， rigidity， tremor， and postural instability improve in STN target. At this time， data show that both STN and GPi DBS are effective for most symptoms， and it is not clear if one is a better target. Some reports demonstrated that there were no significant differences in motor outcome between STN DBS and GPi DBS\\[13\\]. Katz et al. performed a multicenter study that randomized PD patients to either STN or GPi DBS found that stimulation at either target provided similar overall motoric benefits \\[14\\]. They classified 235 subjects by motor subtype： tremor dominant (TD)， intermediate (I)， or postural instability gait difficulty (PIGD)， based on pre-DBS baseline UPDRS scores off-medication \\[14\\]. Their results showed that responsiveness to both GPi and STN DBS is similar among different PD motor subtypes， although the TD motor subtype may have a more significant response to GPi DBS concerning gait. PIGD patients obtained less overall benefit from stimulation \\[14\\]. Williams reported that advantages of the STN target include more medication reduction， less frequent battery changes， and a more favourable economic profile \\[15\\]. However， they also found that advantages of GPi include more robust dyskinesia suppression， easier programming，and greater flexibility in adjusting medications \\[15\\]. Vim stimulation is only effective for tremor， not for the other symptoms of PD. Vim DBS may sometimes be an option in older patients with unilateral tremor-dominant PD \\[13\\]. The PPN is an investigational new target that may be appropriate for patients with gait freezing\\[10\\]. Zona incerta is another potential target for tremor and other cardinal motor manifestations， and this remains under investigation \\[10\\]. Plaha et al. showed that the results of zona incerta DBS are a good improvement \\[16\\].\n\n【52】In appropriately selected patients with advanced PD，DBS of the subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus interna significantly reduces \"off\" time motor symptoms， reduces dyskinesias and im-proves quality of life \\[17-20\\]. Furthermore， recent publications suggest that DBS is superior to best medical therapy to allevi-ate motor symptoms and improve quality of life \\[20， 21\\]. The beneficial effects of DBS on specific motor symptoms (such as tremor， bradykinesia and dyskinesias) appear to be long-lasting\\[17\\]. However， other symptoms， including gait dysfunction and falls， do not necessarily improve after DBS and may even worsen\\[22\\]. In PD patients postural instability and gait impairment are also significant problems which become increasingly severe as the disease progresses even though L-dopa treatment postural impairment is not adequately improved， implying the involve-ment of nondopaminergic pathways. Moreover， besides disease progression and dyskinesias， L-dopa may also be responsible for worsening of posturthe al sway \\[23-26\\]. In other words， pos-tural stability and gait impairment are more variably affected by medications and DBS. There are also conflicting reports on whether functional balance tests improve with DBS \\[27\\]. In re-cent years physical therapy focusing on gait and balance gained more importance. Physical therapies combined with DBS can help to preserve an appropriate level of activity， treat specific dis-abilities and establish new movement patterns. The advanced\n\n【53】PD patients are a good candidate for DBS. Interesting new per-spectives are forthcoming on motor functioning to enhance the positive impacts of DBS. New perspectives of physical therapies on motor functioning enhance positive impacts of medical and surgical treatments.\n\n【54】References\n\n【55】1\\. J.

If accompanied by life-threat-ening arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death， Brugada syndrome (BrS) is diagnosed. The presence of Brugada ECG pattern in absence of the syndrome has come to be known as Brugada phenocopy (BrP).\n\n【26】Case Report： We introduce a case of both Brugada type l and Il patterns unmasked in a 28-year-old female with fever sec-ondary to mastitis. Though fever-induced BrP is a universally known phenomenon， the presentation of both typel and Il patterns presenting in a patient during a single hospitalization makes this case unique from oth-ers. The patient was brought to the emergency department after experiencing a syncopal episode that ap-peared classically vasovagal in nature. Once her fever resolved， her baseline ECG showed no abnormalities.\n\n【27】Conclusions：\n\n【28】Though Brugada ECG pattern may be very alarming， especially after syncope， appropriate management in the case of a fever-induced event would consist of observation with cardiac monitoring， immediate treatment of fever with antipyretics， and antibiotics for suspected infection. Close follow-up by a cardiologist as an outpa-tient is imperative to further ascertain if the patient is at high risk of life-threatening arrhythmias， significant for BrS.\n\n【29】MeSH Keywords： Brugada Syndrome·Electrocardiography· Fever· Syncope\n\n【30】Full-text PDF https：//www.amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/906464\n\n【31】Brugada syndrome (BrS) was first described in 1992 as a he reditary disorder diagnosed on the basis of a clinically signif-icant event： documented ventricular fibrillation， polymorphic ventricular tachycardia， nonvagal syncope， or sudden cardi-ac death \\[1，2\\]. Electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern is character-ized by a minimum of 2 mm J-point elevation and 1 mm ST-segment elevation in at least two of the right precordial leads， V1-V3， with RSR' of the QRS \\[1-3\\]. It was not until 2013 that the term Brugada phenocopy (BrP) was coined， describing the presence of Brugada ECG pattern without manifestations of the syndrome， though there multiple accounts of such phe-nomenon documented prior to its terminology \\[4，5\\]. The prev-alence of Brugada ECG patterns is approximated to be 0.15%， with higher prevalence in Asia， and nine times more common in males than females \\[6-8\\]. In the United States， Brugada ECG pattern is an even rarer occurrence， with a prevalence of approximately 0.012%\\[7，9\\]. In a prospective study by Adler et al.， type I Brugada pattern was 20 times more prevalent among febrile patients \\[10\\]. All aberrant ECGs were inciden-tally found in the febrile patients-none reported syncope or arrhythmia-related symptoms \\[10\\].\n\n【32】Case Report\n\n【33】A 28-year old， G4P4004， Caucasian female with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency department after a witnessed syncopal episode that occurred at a shop-ping mall. She described feelings of warmth， lightheadedness， and palpitations， but lost consciousness before she could sit down. As per bystanders， the patient was unconscious for less than one minute without tonic-clonic movements， tongue bite， and bladder or bowel incontinence. The patient denied confu-sion， slurred speech， or weakness upon awakening. The patient reported three similar episodes in the past， all experienced in the setting of pain - the first occurrence was 12 years prior to presentation. In this instance， the patient reported having left breast pain and subjective fevers for the past week， at-tributing pain to breastfeeding. The patient denied personal history of documented ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia， and any family history of arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death.\n\n【34】Admission vital signs showed temperature of 102.1°F (38.94℃)， blood pressure of 104/93 mm Hg， and pulse of 128 beats per minute， with negative orthostatics. Physical examination re-vealed left breast tenderness without erythema or discharge. It was concluded that fever was due to left breast mastitis. Cardiac auscultation revealed no abnormalities. A 12-lead ECG completed on admission showed sinus tachycardia at108 beats per minute， with normal axis， PR interval， QRS du-ration， and QTc interval. There was RSR' morphology and ST\n\n【35】segment elevations in leads V1 and V2 with coved-type pattern consistent with a type I Brugada (Figure 1). Troponin-I mea-sured was 0.00. Other laboratory studies completed showed absence of hyponatremia with a sodium level of 135 mEq/L， and absence of hypokalemia or hyperkalemia with a potassi-um level of 3.9 mEq/L as a contributing factor to ECG abnor-malities. Urine drug screen was also negative for illicit drugs or controlled substances.\n\n【36】The patient was treated with acetaminophen and oral cepha-lexin. However， on her second day of stay， her leukocyte count increased from 11，800/uL to 17，900/uL and a decision was made to change from oral antibiotics to intravenous ampicil-lin/sulbactam.As her fever subsided and decreased to a tem-perature of 100°F (37.78℃)， her ECG showed regression to type ll Brugada， with ST segment elevations in leads V1 and V2 of saddle back configuration (Figure 2). At a temperature of98.3°F (36.83℃)， her ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with-out evidence of J-point or ST segment elevations (Figure 3). Echocardiogram showed no regional wall motion abnormali-ties， no right ventricular dilation or hypertrophy， and normal left ventricular ejection fraction. The review of telemonitor-ing during 48-hour stay showed absence of ventricular fibril-lation or ventricular tachycardia. On the day of discharge， it was advised that the patient consider genetic testing and car-diac monitoring with an implantable loop recorder- however， she deferred further inpatient workup and was scheduled for a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist to evaluate her in-creased risk of sudden cardiac death. The cardiologist agreed with this plan， as he did not believe that patient's syncopalep-isode was related to Brs but rather by vasovagal phenomenon， supported by history of previous similar syncopal events， and each time having quick recovery without medical intervention.\n\n【37】Discussion\n\n【38】The patient's history of syncope in the setting of pain， with prodromal symptoms of warmth， palpitations， and lighthead-edness seem to be vasovagal in nature， however， she had a fever-induced Brugada ECG pattern that may be a marker of increased risk. Once her fever dissipated， a normal ECG man-ifested suspicious for BrP. In a paper by Gottschalk，et al.， BrP is categorized into three classes： class A where all mandato-ry diagnostic criteria are met， class B where BrP is highly sus-pected but not all diagnostic studies could be completed， and class C where BrP is highly suspected but provocative testing is not justified \\[11\\]. The patient presented fits in class B， and can be specified as having type IB and IIB BrP.\n\n【39】The prevalence of either type l or ll Brugada ECG is approxi-mately 0.15%\\[6，7J， but the presentation of both type l and I Brugada ECG patterns in a single patient is undocumented.\n\n【40】Figure 2. Patient's repeat ECG the day after admission showing Brugada type ll pattern after decrease of temperature from 102.1°F (38.94°C) to 100°F(37.78°C).\n\n【41】Though there are numerous studies looking at the prevalence of Brugada ECG patterns in various countries， there lacks data in how many of those patients presented with more than one type of Brugada ECG pattern. Implantable cardioverter defibril-lator (ICD) implantation is recommended for those with mul-tiple risk factors of nonvagal syncope， familial sudden cardi-ac death， or inducible ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation on electrophysiology study \\[12，13\\]. This patient had no true known risk factors， as her syncope was likely unrelated to ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. It remains controversial as to the most appropriate workup to further risk stratify this patient， but a reasonable approach was to conduct genetic test-ing and long-term cardiac monitoring to rule out ventricular arrhythmias as a cause of syncope. Other possible diagnostic\n\n【42】tests include electrophysiology studies and provocative test-ing with a sodium channel blocker \\[11\\].\n\n【43】There are multiple gene mutations associated with the dis-ease， but about 20% of BrS cases are due to abnormalities in cardiac sodium channels. Mutations in SCN5A gene lead to decreased functioning of these channels in the right ventric-ular epicardium， thereby believed to cause slow conduction and reentry \\[2，14\\]. Another theory proposes that voltage gra-dient across the cardiac layers generates dispersion of epicar-dial repolarization， making it vulnerable to premature impuls-es that lead to ventricular arrhythmias \\[15，16\\]. The mechanism for fever-induced Brugada ECG pattern is not completely un-derstood. Many hypothesize that under higher temperatures，\n\n【44】sodium channels are prone to enter their slow inactivated state \\[17\\]. Additionally， sinus tachycardia often seen in febrile patients reduces the time between consecutive depolarization and does not allow enough time for mutated channels to re-cover from inactivation \\[17\\]. Fever can help unmask BrS， but it can also produce electrocardiographic findings of BrP in oth-erwise healthy individuals.\n\n【45】The most reasonable approach to patients with incidental fe ver-induced BrP is supportive care with antipyretics and clear-ance of infection with antibiotics. Pharmacologic therapies such as antiarrhythmics or beta-blockers do not protect af-fected individuals. Close follow-up as an outpatient is crucial in identifying high-risk patients with Brugada ECG pattern， as treatment requires placement of ICD for prevention of sudden cardiac death \\[12，13\\]. In patients with documented ventricu-lar fibrillation， polymorphic ventricular tachycardia， or abort-ed cardiac death， ICD placement is the only management that decreases mortality \\[12，13\\].\n\n【46】References：\n\n【47】1\\.

This begs the question whether these indi-viduals， though incidentally found， could be at higher risk for sudden cardiac death when compared to individuals present-ing with either only type l or ll Brugada ECG. Fever-induced BrP may be benign and can be treated with monitoring and an-tipyretics. However， it is critical to identify patients that may have an increased incidence of sudden cardiac death. Risk stratification must be done for patients who are at an inter-mediate risk. When type l or Il Brugada pattern is recognized and the patient also has documented ventricular fibrillation or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia，syncope highly suspect-ed to be due to a ventricular arrhythmia， or familial sudden cardiac death， an ICD is the only effective treatment shown to decrease mortality.\n\n【57】Conflicts of Interest\n\n【58】None.\n\n【59】10\\.

The severe inflammatory skin disease has been postulated of having its relation to immunogenetics and exacerbated by various factors. Most GPP cases are sporadic， characterized by cutaneous manifestations of severe erythroderma， scaling skin， the lake of pustules， and may be accompanied by extracutaneous manifestations， including acute respiratory distress syndrome， heart failure， and sepsis. This investigation reported GPP in an elderly man with prior untreated psoriasis vulgaris and pneumonia， which， to our knowledge， was the first case in our secondary regential hospital， Bangli Medika Canti Hospital. The patient underwent systemic and topical corticosteroid therapy， intravenous ceftriaxone， wound dressing， and moisturizer， which yielded a satisfactory result. We present a case and literature review of this distinct phenomenon.\n\n【6】KEYWORDS generalized pustular psoriasis， von Zumbusch， corticosteroid， wound dressing， therapy\n\n【7】Introduction\n\n【8】Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease associated with its genetic na-ture and autoimmune pathogenic traits. Globally， the prevalence of psoriasis is approximately about 2-4% but varies geograph-ically.\\[1， 2\\] In Asia， a lower prevalence was reported (China\\[0.3%\\]， Taiwan \\[0.19-0.24%\\]， and Japan \\[0.34%\\])， while a higher prevalence was seen in Europe.\\[3\\] Psoriasis has several different clinical subtypes： psoriasis vulgaris， inverse psoriasis， guttate psoriasis， and pustular psoriasis. Specifically， the pustular form presents itself in several manifestations， such as GPP of von Zumbusch， impetigo herpetiformis， and two variants of local-ized pustular psoriasis (palmoplantar pustulosis and acroder-\n\n【9】Copyright @ 2021 by the Bulgarian Association of Young Surgeons\n\n【10】DOI：10.5455/IJMRCR.Von-Zumbusch-balinese-elderly\n\n【11】First Received： March 4， 2021Accepted： April 19， 2021Associate Editor： Ivan Inkov (BG)；\n\n【12】Corresponding author： Dr. Paulus Mario Christopher； Bangli Medika Canti\n\n【13】Hospital - L.C.

The generalized erythema with plaques and pustules started from one month before and came in waves with exacerbation and quiescence periods. Initially， the patient complaint of fever and malaise followed by pustu-lar lesions on an erythematous base and pruritus. History of sore throat， dysuria， toothache， cold， cough， use of traditional oil， and consumption of new drugs within the previous eight weeks was denied. The past medical history revealed untreated psoriasis vulgaris. In contrast， further past medical history (dia-betes mellitus， hypertension， cardiac disorders， asthma， stroke， past surgery， allergies， and routine drug(s) consumptions) were remarkable with no family history of psoriasis.\n\n【17】At admission， the patient was febrile (38.9oC) and tachypneic(24 times/minute)， while the other vital signs were within nor-mal limits. Body mass index was within the normal range. On physical examination， bilateral rhonchi were found with normal\n\n【18】Figure 1-5b. Dermatological status. Figure 1-5a.

Dermatological examination revealed generalized multiple erythematous plaques with white-to-yellowish crust and hyperkeratotic lesions on the anterior to posterior thorax and abdomen， upper and lower extremities. We also found mul-tiple pustules on the lower extremities， with some confluent pustules forming a lake of pus on an erythematous base. Aus-pitz sign was positive. Psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score and body surface area (BSA) were 63，6%(severe) and 90%(severe)，respectively.\n\n【20】The laboratory examination revealed leucocytosis， 18.800/uL with 92.2% neutrophil，4.2% lymphocyte， and 3.6% monocyte. Chest X-ray showed bilateral lung opacities. Further histopatho-logical examination was not conducted due to resource limita-tion. A generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) of von Zumbusch with secondary bacterial infection and pneumonia was estab lished. After reviewing the available therapeutic options， during the acute phase， we decided to initiate treatment with intra-venous methylprednisolone 62.5 mg and ceftriaxone 1 gram q12hr， oral chlorpheniramine maleate 4 mg q8hr， topical des-oximetasone 0.25% and gentamycin 0.1% cream q8hr， topical urea 20% cream q12hr， and dressed with isotonic saline solu-tion (NS 0.9%) for 15 minutes every q4hr (Figure 1-5b). After a week of therapy， the patient was discharged with a 59，75%improvement in the PASI score with methylprednisolone switch-ing from intravenous to oral 16 mg q8hr and subsequent drugs and doses. Subsequent follow-up was done for tapering off the methylprednisolone and revealed the resolution of the disease.\n\n【21】Discussion\n\n【22】Generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) of von Zumbusch is a rare alarming， and life-threatening variant of psoriasis. The pathoim-munology of the GPP of von Zumbusch is not yet completely understood. The current pathoimmunogenetic mechanism in-volved three gene mutations， accounting for less than 30% of\n\n【23】GPP cases， identified in 1) interleukin-36 receptor antagonist(IL36RN)，2) caspase recruitment family member 14 (CARD14)， and 3) APIS3 have been identified in GPP. IL36RN encodes IL-36 receptor antagonist (IL36Ra)， suppressing the function of IL-36， which are potent inducers of neutrophil chemokines. In contrast， CARD14 encodes a keratinocyte adaptor protein me-diating TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2)-dependent activation of NF-kB signalling. AP1S3 encodes a subunit of the adaptor protein 1 complex， a transcription factor for regulating keratins expression in keratinocytes. These mutations lead to dysregulation of pro-inflammatory pathways.\\[4-6\\]\n\n【24】Generalized pustular psoriasis of von Zumbusch is one of the most severe life-threatening and often recalcitrant forms of psoriasis. The lesions are characterized by acute onset of painful erythematous skin lesions to full-blown erythroderma that quickly may progress to scattered sterile pustules 2 to 3mm in diameter and coalesce into lakes of pus accompanied by systemic symptoms (fever， chills，pruritus， dehydration， tachy-cardia， anaemia， weight loss， arthralgia， and weakness). After several days to weeks， the pustules typically resolve with resid-ual erythema and extensive scaling. Laboratory examinations are in line with systemic inflammation revealing leucocytosis and lymphopenia， high erythrocyte sedimentation rate， hypoal-buminemia， electrolyte abnormalities， and elevation of the liver and/or renal function parameters. Histopathological evalua-tion of skin biopsy often revealed Kogoj's spongiform pustules(accumulations of neutrophils under the stratum corneum) and classical findings of psoriasis such as parakeratosis， acanthosis， hyperkeratosis， elongation of rete ridges， diminished stratum granulosum， capillary dilation of the papillary dermis， Munro’s microabscesses， and superficial perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrations.\\[2， 5，6\\]\n\n【25】Diagnosis of GPP of von Zumbusch is based on the diagnostic criteria of history taking， physical examination， and/or support-ive examinations (laboratory and histopathological examina-tions) (Table 1). Additionally， comprehensive history taking concerning the history of underlying psoriasis vulgaris， medica-tions， infections，and/or pregnancy， which may serve as a trigger factor as well as a diagnostic clue， should be noted. Alarming systemic symptoms， such as fever， chills， dyspnea， and delirium， and monitoring of life-threatening complications may suggest the need for inpatient admission. Complication(s) that may occur in patients with GPP include sepsis， acute renal failure， neutrophilic cholangitis， high-output congestive heart failure， acute respiratory distress syndrome， and death.\\[5\\]\n\n【26】Assessment of psoriasis severity is used to determine the management and evaluate the therapeutic outcomes. Various assessments can be used， from generic (e.g.， 36-Item Short Form Survey) to disease-specific (PASI) and site-specific tools (e.g. Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index). Based on the PASI score， psoria-sis is categorized into three groups， PASI score of <10 for mild psoriasis， PASI score of 10-20 for moderate PASI score of >20 for severe psoriasis. In our case， the initial PASI score was 63，6%(severe).7\\]\n\n【27】Management of GPP has no standard guideline； treatment is based on the extent of the area involved， disease severity， and underlying risk factors. Treatment for GPP often follows the ex-isting guidance for plaque psoriasis. Variety of treatment options for adult GPP are 1) systemic therapy (acitretin， cyclosporine， methotrexate， anti-TNF-a \\[infliximab， adalimumab， and etan-ercept\\]， and oral corticosteroids)， 2) topical therapy (corticos-teroids， calcipotriene \\[+ systemic agent， tacrolimus \\[+ systemic\n\n|  | Year 2003  | Systemic symptoms  | Pustules  | Histopathology  | Laboratory abnormalities  | PV  | Recurrence  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Year 2003  | Systemic symptoms  |  |  | 干 Left shift leukocytosis， elevated  |  |  |\n|  | Year 2003  | Systemic symptoms  |  |  | 干 Left shift leukocytosis， elevated  |  | 十 Clinical and  |\n| Umezawa et al  | Year 2003  | Systemic symptoms  |  |  | 干 Left shift leukocytosis， elevated  |  | 十 Clinical and  |\n| Umezawa et al  | Year 2003  | 十  | 十  | 十  | 干 Left shift leukocytosis， elevated  |  | 十 Clinical and  |\n| Umezawa et al  | Year 2003  | 十  | 十  | 十  | 干 Left shift leukocytosis， elevated  |  | 十 Clinical and  |\n| Umezawa et al  | Year 2003  | 十  | 十  | 十  | 干 Left shift leukocytosis， elevated  |  | 十 Clinical and  |\n| Umezawa et al  | Year 2003  |  |  |  | ESR，elevated CRPelevated ASTO，elevated IgG or IgA， hypoproteinemia， hypocalcemia  |  |  |\n| Umezawa et al  | Year 2003  | Fever and  | Multiple isolated septic pustules on erythematous  | Kogoj's spongiform  | ESR，elevated CRPelevated ASTO，elevated IgG or IgA， hypoproteinemia， hypocalcemia  |  | histopathological  |\n| Umezawa et al  | Year 2003  | malaise  | Multiple isolated septic pustules on erythematous  | Diistules  | ESR，elevated CRPelevated ASTO，elevated IgG or IgA， hypoproteinemia， hypocalcemia  |  | findings  |\n| Umezawa et al  | Year 2003  | malaise  | skin  | Diistules  | ESR，elevated CRPelevated ASTO，elevated IgG or IgA， hypoproteinemia， hypocalcemia  |  | findings  |\n| Umezawa et al  | Year 2003  |  |  |  | ESR，elevated CRPelevated ASTO，elevated IgG or IgA， hypoproteinemia， hypocalcemia  |  | 十 Relapsing (>1 episode)  |\n| Navarini et al  | 2017  | 士  |  |  | ESR，elevated CRPelevated ASTO，elevated IgG or IgA， hypoproteinemia， hypocalcemia  | 土  | 十 Relapsing (>1 episode)  |\n| Navarini et al  | 2017  | 士  | Primary， sterile，  |  |  | 土  | 十 Relapsing (>1 episode)  |\n| Navarini et al  | 2017  | 士  | macroscopically visible  |  |  | 土  | or persistent(>3  |\n| Navarini et al  | 2017  | 士  | epidermal pustules on  |  |  | 土  | months)  |\n| Navarini et al  | 2017  | 士  | non-acral skin  |  |  | 土  | 干  |\n| Fujita et al  | 2018  | 十  | non-acral skin  | 十  |  |  | 干  |\n| Fujita et al  | 2018  | 十  | Systemic or extensive  | 十  |  |  | Clinical and  |\n| Fujita et al  | 2018  | Fever and fatigue  | flush accompanied by multiple sterile pustules  | Kogoj's spongiform Dustules  |  |  | histopathological findings  |\n| ESR： erythrocyte sedimentation rate；PV： psoriasis vulgaris； CRP： C-reactive protein； ASTO： anti-streptolysin O antibody levels； +： present； ±： present or absent； -： absent； In  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n【29】ESR： erythrocyte sedimentation rate；PV： psoriasis vulgaris； CRP： C-reactive protein； ASTO： anti-streptolysin O antibody levels； +： present； ±： present or absent； -： absent； In Fujita et al： a definitive diagnosis of GPP can be established in patients with all four feature and suspected in those with pustules and histopathological findings\n\n【30】agent\\]， and psoralen +UVA \\[PUVA\\])，3) other biologic therapy(anti-IL-1 agents \\[anakinra， canakinumab， and gevokizumab\\]， anti-IL-17 agents \\[secukinumab，brodalumab， and ixekizumab\\]， and anti-IL-23 agents \\[guselkumab and ustekinumabD)， and 4) other therapy (granulocyte and monocyte adsorption apheresis and dapsone).\\[8，9\\] In this opportunity， we will focus primarily on systemic and topical corticosteroids as a primary agent for anti-inflammatory and immunosuppression with our experience in a rural setting.\n\n【31】Corticosteroid/glucocorticoid played a substantial role in dermatologic therapy and was discovered in 1950. Naturally occurring glucocorticoids， cortisol (hydrocortisone)， are synthe-sized from cholesterol by the adrenal cortex. Glucocorticoid action involves passive diffusion through the cell membrane， followed by binding to soluble receptor proteins in the cyto-plasm. The hormone-receptor complex then translocates to the nucleus and regulates the transcription of a limited number of target genes. There are three main mechanisms of glucocor-ticoid action； 1) direct effects on gene expression through the binding of glucocorticoid receptors to glucocorticoid responsive elements inducing the expression of annexin A1， annexin A1receptor (ALXR)， and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase 1， 2) indirect effects on gene expression through the interactions of glucocorticoid receptors with other transcrip-tion factors， and 3) glucocorticoid receptor-mediated effects on the second messenger cascades through nongenomic pathways yielding rapid effects.\\[10-12\\]\n\n【32】Through these mechanisms， corticosteroid modulates media-tors' levels of inflammation and immune response， suppressing the role of monocytes and lymphocytes (both Th1 and Th2 cells) and macrophage functions. (10) Systemic medication is reserved for managing moderate-to-severe psoriasis， particularly when phototherapy is not feasible or effective.\\[13\\] In a study from Japan， short-term systemic corticosteroids for GPP during se-vere systemic clinical findings may prove effective.\\[14\\] Topical corticosteroids are an integral part of the psoriasis therapeutic ar-mamentarium as monotherapy or complement to systemic ther-apy. The use of topical therapy as adjuvant therapy in moderate to severe psoriasis may also be beneficial. It can potentially min-imize the amount of phototherapy or systemic agent required for satisfactory disease control to be achieved.\\[12\\] Nonetheless， close observation is recommended to conserve the epidermal function.3\\]\n\n【33】The main drawbacks to corticosteroid use for psoriasis in-clude the potential rebound on drug withdrawal necessitating a higher dose (tachyphylaxis)， flare-ups， and the long-term side\n\n【34】effects， such as skin atrophy， striae， and telangiectasia or sys-temic effects of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression， elevated glucose level， osteoporosis， cardiovascular， gastroin-testinal， and neurological complications.\\[15， 16\\]\n\n【35】Adjunctive corticosteroid/glucocorticoid therapy includes wound cleansing and dressing and concomitant moisturiz-ers.\\[17\\] Our rationale of choosing isotonic NS as our solution of choice for wound cleansing and the dressing was based on its 1) isotonic composition leading to no additional nor with-drawal of fluid from the wound bed， 2) hypoallergic properties，3) no alteration of normal bacterial flora in wound area leading to skin barrier function improvement， enhancement of stratum corneum hydration， and reduction of dryness and inflamma-tion.\\[18\\] Frequent， continuous changes are required to maintain adequate tonicity and permeability for the dressing to be effec-tive clinically. There is usually blood and dried exudate adherent to the ulcer dressing on removal， forming a non-permeable bar-rier that prevents further movement of fluid and electrolytes from the wound into the dressing.\\[19\\] Urea as our moisturizer of choice is due to its hygroscopic properties leading to hydration of the stratum corneum， improvement of skin barrier function， and enhancement of penetration. Research has shown that urea appeared to impact the proliferation of epidermis through gene expression involved in keratinocyte differentiation， subsequent epidermal thinning at a molecular level， epidermal lipid synthe-sis (TG-1， involucrin， loricrin， and filaggrin)， and antimicrobial peptides production (LL-37 and p-defensin-2).\\[20\\]\n\n【36】Conclusion\n\n【37】Generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) of von Zumbusch is a rare variant of psoriasis resulting from the interplay between genetic， immune， and trigger factor(s). There have been no specific guidelines for the management of GPP. Advancement in understanding risk factors， pathogenesis， and therapeutic options will aid in a comprehensive approach among physicians caring for GPP.\n\n【38】Author's Contributions\n\n【39】All of the authors contributed equally from the conception and design， data acquisition and analysis， drafting， and reporting of the case report.\n\n【40】Ethical Approval\n\n【41】The patient has signed informed consent and agreed for the publication of their data and any accompanying images as a case report article.\n\n【42】Funding\n\n【43】This work did not receive any grant from funding agencies in the public， commercial， or not-for-profit sectors.\n\n【44】Conflict of interest\n\n【45】There are no conflicts of interest to declare by any of the authors of this study.\n\n【46】References\n\n【47】1\\.
